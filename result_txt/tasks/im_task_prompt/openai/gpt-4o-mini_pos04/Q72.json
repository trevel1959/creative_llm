    "**Eco-Friendly Biodegradable Materials**: Develop a surfboard made from biodegradable materials, such as hemp fiber or bio-resin. This would reduce the environmental impact of surfboard production and disposal. Additionally, the board could be designed to break down naturally after a certain period or upon disposal, leaving no harmful waste behind.",
    "**Modular Surfboard Design**: Create a surfboard with a modular design that allows surfers to customize their boards for different conditions. Components like fins, tail shapes, and even the core material could be interchangeable, enabling surfers to adapt their board for various wave types and riding styles without needing to buy multiple boards.",
    "**Integrated Solar-Powered LED Lights**: Incorporate solar panels on the top surface of the surfboard that power LED lights along the edges. This feature would enhance visibility for surfers riding at dawn or dusk, improving safety. The lights could also be programmed to change colors based on wave height or speed, creating a visually stunning experience.",
    "**Surfboard with Built-in GPS and Tracking System**: Design a surfboard equipped with a GPS and tracking system that allows surfers to log their rides, track their progress, and find optimal surf spots. The data could be shared with a community app where surfers can connect, share experiences, and even find partners for surf sessions.",
    "**Hydrodynamic Surface Technology**: Develop a surfboard with a specialized hydrodynamic surface that reduces drag in the water. This could involve creating a textured surface that mimics the skin of certain fish, allowing for smoother gliding and increased speed. The technology could also enhance stability, making it easier for beginners to ride."
