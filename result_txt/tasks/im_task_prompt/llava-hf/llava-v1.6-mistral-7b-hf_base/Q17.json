    "SMART WASHING MACHINE: Another idea is to make a smart washing machine that can be controlled remotely via an app or voice command. This could include features such as programmable wash cycles, automatic load detection, and notification alerts when the laundry is ready for removal.",
    "WASHING MACHINE MONITOR: A washing machine with a built-in monitor could be an improvement feature that provides real-time updates on the washing process. This could include information such as cycle duration, water and energy consumption, and any errors or issues that may arise.",
    "WASHING MACHINE ALERT SYSTEMS: Incorporating a washing machine alert system could be another creative feature. This could include notifications when the load is imbalanced, when the machine needs maintenance, or when the end of the cycle is approaching.",
    "WASHING MACHINE WITH REUSABLE DRUM LINERS: To reduce the environmental impact of plastic laundry baskets, a washing machine with reusable drum liners made of sustainable materials could be an improvement. This could help to lower the amount of plastic waste generated by washing machines.",
    "WASHING MACHINE WITH BUILT-IN CLEANING CYCLES: A washing machine with built-in cleaning cycles for different types of fabrics and materials could be an improvement. This could include specific cycles for delicates, cottons, towels, and more, allowing users to select the most appropriate cycle for their laundry needs."
