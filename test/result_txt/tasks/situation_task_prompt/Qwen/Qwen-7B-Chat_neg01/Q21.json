    "Develop a local search engine that uses the physical world around you as its database. For example, if you're standing in front of a library, your device could scan for Wi-Fi signals from the library's network and use that information to provide you with relevant books or articles.",
    "Create a distributed network of devices that can share information with each other without relying on centralized servers. Each device could be programmed to store a small amount of data and to communicate with nearby devices to build a larger, more comprehensive network.",
    "Design an offline-capable browser that can still display web pages even when there is no internet connection. This could involve using techniques such as caching frequently visited pages or using local storage to save data that can be retrieved later.",
    "Create a system of QR codes that can be used to store and retrieve information in a decentralized manner. When someone scans a QR code, their device can connect to a nearby device that has the information stored on it, allowing them to access the data without needing to rely on a central server.",
    "Develop a type of virtual reality interface that allows users to interact with digital information in a way that feels more like interacting with physical objects. For example, a user could point their VR headset at a bookshelf and see a 3D model of the shelf appear in front of them, along with information about the books on the shelf. By creating a more immersive experience, this could make accessing information feel more natural and intuitive."
