    "**Flavor Infusion Chamber**: Add a detachable flavor infusion chamber that allows users to experiment with different herbs, spices, or flavored oils while brewing. This chamber could be designed to steep these additional ingredients into the coffee, creating unique flavor profiles. Users could purchase flavor packs to enhance their coffee experience, catering to the growing interest in gourmet and artisanal coffee.",
    "**Self-Cleaning Mechanism**: Incorporate a self-cleaning feature that uses a combination of steam and UV light to sanitize the internal components of the coffee maker. This would eliminate the need for users to manually clean the machine and ensure that every cup of coffee is free from bacteria and buildup. A notification system could alert users when the cleaning cycle is complete.",
    "**Personalized Coffee Profiles**: Develop a user-friendly interface that allows multiple users to create personalized coffee profiles. Each profile could save preferences for brew strength, temperature, and coffee type. Users could switch profiles with a simple voice command or touch interface, making it ideal for households with different coffee preferences.",
    "**Eco-Friendly Design**: Design the coffee maker with sustainability in mind, using biodegradable materials for all non-electrical components. Additionally, it could feature a built-in composting system for coffee grounds, allowing users to easily dispose of waste and even use it as fertilizer for plants. An energy-efficient mode could also be added to minimize electricity usage when not in active brewing.",
    "**Interactive Coffee Experience**: Create an augmented reality (AR) feature that connects with a mobile app. When users point their device at the coffee maker, they can access tutorials, coffee recipes, and brewing tips in real-time. This could include guided steps for creating various coffee drinks, enhancing the brewing experience, and educating users about different coffee beans and brewing methods."
