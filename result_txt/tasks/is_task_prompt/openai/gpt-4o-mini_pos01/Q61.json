    "In a lush, green forest lived a bear named Benny who had an insatiable love for honey. Every day, he would climb trees, risking his safety just to reach the sweet, golden treasure. One sunny afternoon, Benny discovered a hidden grove filled with the biggest honeycombs he had ever seen. Overwhelmed by temptation, he devoured so much honey that he felt too heavy to move. As the sun set, he realized he had become stuck in a tree. His friends, worried about him, worked together to free him. From that day on, Benny learned moderation and shared his honey with others, finding joy in friendship.",
