    "Sand timer: A sand timer is a container filled with sand that has an hourglass shape. As the sand flows from one end to the other, it indicates the passing of time. Sand timers are easy to use and can be a fun way to teach children about time.",
    "Water clock: A water clock is a device that uses water to measure the passage of time. The water flows through a series of pipes and into a container, where it is collected and drained at regular intervals. The amount of time it takes for the water to flow through the pipes can be used to determine the time.",
    "Pendulum clock: A pendulum clock uses a swinging pendulum to keep track of time. The pendulum is attached to a clock face and swings back and forth, causing the hands on the clock to move. Pendulum clocks are accurate and reliable, but they require regular winding and maintenance.",
    "Atomic clock: An atomic clock uses the vibrations of atoms to keep track of time. The atoms are excited and then allowed to return to their original state, emitting a specific frequency of radiation. This frequency can be used to determine the time. Atomic clocks are highly accurate and are used in scientific research and other applications.",
    "Smartphone or smartwatch: In today's digital age, many people rely on their smartphones or smartwatches to keep track of time. These devices can be easily accessed and used to tell the time, set alarms, and even track physical activity."
