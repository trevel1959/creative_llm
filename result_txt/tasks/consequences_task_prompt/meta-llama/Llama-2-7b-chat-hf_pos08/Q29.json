It would be challenging to process, analyze, and prioritize the information, leading to information overload. This could result in difficulty concentrating, decision-making difficulties, and a decreased ability to retain new information.",
    "Lack of Focus: Without the ability to forget, humans would constantly be bombarded with every piece of information they've ever read. This would make it difficult to focus on any one thing, as their minds would be constantly jumping from one piece of information to another. This could lead to a lack of depth in understanding and a decreased ability to retain new information.",
    "Increased Anxiety: The constant barrage of information would lead to increased anxiety and stress levels. The inability to forget would make it difficult to relax and enjoy the present moment, as the mind would be constantly preoccupied with the vast amount of information stored.",
    "Decreased Creativity: With the ability to remember everything, humans would have less room for creativity and imagination. The constant barrage of information would make it difficult to come up with new ideas, as every thought and concept would be compared to the vast amount of information stored in their minds.",
    "Ethical Concerns: With the ability to remember everything, there would be significant ethical concerns regarding privacy and consent. Every piece of information read would be stored in a person's mind, making it difficult to maintain privacy and confidentiality. Additionally, the ability to remember everything would raise questions about informed consent, as individuals would be unable to forget any information they had read, including potentially harmful or unethical content."
