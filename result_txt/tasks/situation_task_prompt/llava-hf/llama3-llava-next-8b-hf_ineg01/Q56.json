    "The Mirrorless Mirror: Another solution could be the development of a mirrorless mirror, a device that uses sensors and AI algorithms to detect the user's movements and position. This device could be mounted on a wall or placed on a stand, allowing users to see their reflection without the need for a physical mirror.",
    "The Mirrorless Mirrorless: This concept takes the idea of a mirrorless mirror to the next level by eliminating the need for any physical device. Users could wear a smart wristband that uses sensors and AI algorithms to detect their movements and position, allowing them to see their reflection without the need for a physical mirror.",
