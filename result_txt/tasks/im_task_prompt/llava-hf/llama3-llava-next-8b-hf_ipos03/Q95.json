    "Laundry Sorting System: The laundry basket could be designed with a built-in sorting system that automatically separates different types of fabrics. This would save time and effort, as users would not have to sort their laundry before washing it. The system could use sensors and machine learning algorithms to identify the type of fabric and place it in the appropriate compartment.",
    "Eco-Friendly Laundry Basket: The laundry basket could be made from sustainable materials, such as bamboo or recycled plastic. This would reduce the environmental impact of the laundry basket and make it more eco-friendly.",
    "Expandable Laundry Basket: The laundry basket could be designed with expandable compartments, allowing users to easily add more storage space as needed. This would be particularly useful for families with multiple children or for people who like to do laundry in bulk.",
    "Laundry Folding System: The laundry basket could include a built-in folding system that automatically folds clothes after they are dried. This would save time and effort, as users would not have to manually fold their laundry.",
    "Laundry Aroma System: The laundry basket could be equipped with a built-in aroma system that releases a pleasant scent while the laundry is drying. This would make the laundry process more enjoyable and pleasant."
