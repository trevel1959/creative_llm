    "**Eco-Cycle Tower**: Design a building that doubles as a self-sustaining ecosystem. The tower's exterior is covered in a lush, vertically-stacked garden, with each floor featuring a unique microclimate. The building's structure is composed of recycled materials, and the rooftop features a large solar panel array and a rainwater harvesting system. The tower's inhabitants can enjoy fresh air, natural light, and stunning views while minimizing the building's carbon footprint.",
    "**The Orbital Habitat**: Imagine a high-rise building that defies gravity, with a rotating section that creates artificial gravity through centrifugal force. This allows for a more comfortable living experience in the upper floors, while the lower floors remain gravity-free for research or entertainment purposes. The building's unique design also incorporates a massive, retractable dome for stargazing and observation.",
    "**The AquaSpire**: Envision a high-rise building that incorporates a massive, spiral-shaped aquarium. The building's exterior is covered in a gleaming, translucent material that allows natural light to filter in, while the interior features a stunning array of marine life. The building's inhabitants can enjoy the soothing sounds and sights of the ocean while still being in the heart of the city.",
    "**The Bio-Dome**: Design a high-rise building that is a fully enclosed, self-sustaining ecosystem. The building's exterior is covered in a thick, transparent dome that filters in natural light and regulates temperature. The interior features a lush, tropical environment with a diverse array of plant and animal species. The building's inhabitants can enjoy a unique, immersive experience while minimizing their impact on the environment.",
    "**The SkyPod**: Imagine a high-rise building that consists of a series of interconnected, modular \"pods\" that can be easily added or removed as needed. Each pod features a unique, futuristic design and is equipped with advanced technology for sustainable living. The building's inhabitants can enjoy a dynamic, ever-changing environment while still being connected to the rest of the city."
