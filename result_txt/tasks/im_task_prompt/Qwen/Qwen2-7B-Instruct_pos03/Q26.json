Additionally, it could include features like smart reminders to empty the bin, monitor usage, and even suggest recycling options.",
    "**Eco-Friendly Trash Can**: Develop a trash can that is made from recycled materials and designed for sustainability. The can could have a compact design that minimizes its environmental footprint. It might feature a biodegradable liner, an odor control system powered by natural ingredients, and a recycling section for separating recyclable materials. This concept not only promotes recycling but also encourages users to think about their waste management practices.",
    "**Trash Can as a Personal Health Monitor**: Integrate a health monitoring system into a trash can. This could involve using motion sensors to detect when someone throws away food waste, which can then be analyzed for nutritional content. The data could provide personalized dietary advice or even contribute to a community nutrition program. This idea combines everyday household use with personal health improvement, making it both practical and beneficial.",
    "**Interactive Trash Can for Education**: Create a trash can that serves as an educational tool for children.

With colorful designs and fun animations, this trash can could make learning about environmental responsibility enjoyable and engaging for young minds.",
    "**Trash Can as a Community Resource Center**: Design a large, public trash can that doubles as a community resource hub. This can include a digital screen displaying local news, events, and information, as well as a space for community members to leave small items (like books, toys, or clothing) for others to take. It could also feature a QR code linking to online resources or a community forum. This idea fosters community interaction and resource sharing while keeping the environment clean."
