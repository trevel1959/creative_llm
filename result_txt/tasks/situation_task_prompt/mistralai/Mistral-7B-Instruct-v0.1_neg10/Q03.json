    "If your house were to suddenly disappear, where would you live?",
    "If my house disappeared, I would live in a treehouse in the woods. I have always dreamed of living in a treehouse and this would be the perfect opportunity to make it a reality. I would build a sturdy treehouse with all the amenities I need, such as a bed, a stove, and a toilet.",
    "If my house disappeared, I would live in a van. I have always wanted to travel the world and this would be the perfect opportunity to do so. I would buy a van and convert it into a cozy living space, complete with a bed, a stove, and a toilet. I would then hit the road and explore the world.",
    "If my house disappeared, I would live in a cave. I have always been fascinated by caves and would love to live in one. I would find a secluded cave and build a small home inside, complete with a bed, a stove, and a toilet. I would live off the grid and enjoy the peace and solitude of living in a natural environment.",
    "If my house disappeared, I would live in a treehouse in the jungle. I would build a treehouse high up in the jungle canopy and live off the land. I would hunt and fish for food, grow my own vegetables, and collect rainwater for drinking. I would enjoy the adventure of living in the wilderness and the peace and quiet of the jungle."
