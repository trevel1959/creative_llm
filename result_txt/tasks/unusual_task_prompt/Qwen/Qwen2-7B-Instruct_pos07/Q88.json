The box can be designed to be reusable, perhaps as a small bin for other recyclables after the tissues are used up. This idea promotes environmental sustainability and encourages eco-conscious behavior.",
    "**Interactive Tissue Box**: Create an interactive tissue box that also serves as a digital assistant.

The tissues could be dispensed through a small slot, providing a convenient and futuristic experience.",
    "**Themed Tissue Boxes**: Offer a variety of themed tissue boxes that cater to different occasions or preferences.

    "**Health-focused Tissue Box**: Develop a tissue box that includes a built-in air purifier or a UV sterilizer. This innovative feature would ensure that tissues are free from bacteria or viruses, making it particularly useful during cold and flu seasons.
