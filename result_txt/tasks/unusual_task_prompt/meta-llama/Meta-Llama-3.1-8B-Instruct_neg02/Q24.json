    "**Toothbrush with Built-in Microchip**: Design a toothbrush with a microchip that tracks your oral hygiene habits. The microchip can monitor the time spent brushing, the areas of the mouth that need more attention, and even detect signs of oral health issues like plaque buildup or gum disease. The data can be synced with a mobile app, providing personalized recommendations for improvement. The toothbrush can also vibrate or emit a gentle beep to remind you to brush for the full recommended 2 minutes.",
    "**Toothbrush with Color-Changing Bristles**: Create a toothbrush with bristles that change color based on the user's oral health. The bristles can shift from blue (indicating good oral health) to red (indicating poor oral health) or even yellow (indicating the presence of plaque). This visual cue can motivate users to maintain better oral hygiene habits and make adjustments to their brushing technique.",
    "**Toothbrush with Integrated UV Sanitizer**: Develop a toothbrush with an integrated UV sanitizer that eliminates bacteria and germs on the bristles. The UV light can be activated after brushing, ensuring that the toothbrush is sanitized and ready for the next use. This feature can be especially beneficial for people with weakened immune systems or those who travel frequently.",
    "**Toothbrush with AI-Powered Brushing Technique Feedback**: Design a toothbrush that uses AI to analyze the user's brushing technique and provide real-time feedback. The toothbrush can detect the pressure, speed, and direction of the brushstrokes, offering personalized recommendations for improvement. This feature can help users develop a more effective brushing technique, leading to better oral health outcomes.",
    "**Toothbrush with Built-in Water Flosser**: Create a toothbrush that incorporates a built-in water flosser, allowing users to floss and brush their teeth simultaneously. The water flosser can be controlled by a separate button or integrated into the toothbrush handle, making it easy to switch between brushing and flossing modes. This feature can be especially beneficial for people with tight spaces between their teeth or those who struggle with traditional flossing methods."
