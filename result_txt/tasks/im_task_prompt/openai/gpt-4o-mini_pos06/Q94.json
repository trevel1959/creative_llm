    "**Color-Changing Wax**: Develop a candle with thermochromic wax that changes color as it burns. This could be achieved by incorporating pigments that react to heat. As the candle melts, it could transition through a spectrum of colors, providing a visual spectacle that adds to the mood of the environment, making it perfect for parties or romantic dinners.",
    "**Mood Candle**: Create a line of candles that change their scent and color based on the user’s mood, detected through a wearable device that monitors physiological indicators like heart rate or skin temperature. The candle would adjust its fragrance and hue to promote relaxation, energy, or focus, making it a personalized wellness tool.",
    "**Eco-Friendly Candle with Seed Paper**: Design a candle that, once fully burned, leaves behind a biodegradable container filled with seed paper. After use, consumers can plant the remnants to grow flowers or herbs. This not only promotes sustainability but also encourages users to create a lasting memory from their candle experience.",
    "**Candle with Embedded Bluetooth Speakers**: Incorporate small Bluetooth speakers into the base of the candle. Users can connect their devices to play music or ambient sounds while enjoying the candle's light. This feature would create a multi-sensory experience, making it ideal for relaxation, meditation, or entertaining guests.",
    "**Smart Candle with Safety Features**: Develop a smart candle that uses sensors to detect its surroundings. If it senses that it’s been knocked over or is too close to flammable materials, it automatically extinguishes itself. This would provide peace of mind for users, especially in households with pets or small children."
