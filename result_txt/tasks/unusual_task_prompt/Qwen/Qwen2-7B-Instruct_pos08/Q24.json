    "**Teeth Whitening Toothbrush**: Design a toothbrush that incorporates LED lights in the bristles which emit a specific wavelength of light that accelerates the whitening process when used with teeth whitening gel. The user would need to follow a brief protocol (like brushing for two minutes twice a day) for several weeks to see results. This idea merges dental hygiene with cosmetic enhancement, potentially making it an attractive product for people looking for a convenient way to improve their smile without extensive treatments.",
    "**Self-Healing Toothbrush**: Develop a toothbrush that can repair itself after being damaged or worn down. This could involve a special coating that reforms minor fractures or abrasions over time, significantly extending the life of the brush. It would be especially beneficial for those who are prone to damaging their brushes frequently due to rough use or aggressive brushing habits.",
    "**Dental Health Monitoring Toothbrush**: Create a toothbrush equipped with sensors that can detect plaque buildup, gum inflammation, and other signs of oral health issues. It would sync with a smartphone app that provides personalized feedback on brushing technique, suggests areas requiring more attention, and tracks long-term oral health trends. This tool could help users maintain better oral health by catching potential problems early.",
    "**Customizable Oral Care System**: Design a toothbrush that comes with interchangeable heads tailored to different dental needs, such as sensitive teeth, deep cleaning, or whitening. Users could switch out heads based on their current oral health goals, providing a more versatile and efficient approach to dental care.",
    "**Innovative Oral Hygiene Accessories**: Develop a line of accessories that work alongside a standard toothbrush, enhancing its effectiveness. For example:    - **Teeth Whitening Strips**: A set of strips that fit over the teeth while brushing, delivering concentrated whitening agents directly to the enamel surface."
