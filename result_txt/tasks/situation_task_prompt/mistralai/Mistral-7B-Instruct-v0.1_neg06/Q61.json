    "Invent a pollination machine: Create a device that can be used to manually pollinate plants. The machine can have a brush with pollen that can be applied to the stigma of the flower.",
    "Use genetic engineering: Use genetic engineering techniques to modify the plants so that they can self-pollinate. This would eliminate the need for pollinators altogether.",
    "Create a pollination drone: Develop a drone that can be used to pollinate plants. The drone can be equipped with pollen and can fly over the plants to pollinate them.",
    "Use water to pollinate: Develop a technique that uses water to pollinate plants. This can be done by spraying water on the flowers, which will cause the pollen to the stigma of the flower.",
    "Use animals to pollinate: Develop a method that uses animals to pollinate plants. This can be done by training animals to pollinate the plants, or by introducing animals into the ecosystem that are natural pollinators."
