    "**Firewood and Stone Oven Method:** In the absence of conventional cooking equipment, you can use firewood and stones to cook your meal. First, create a large fire pit or gather firewood to build a fire. Then, use stones to create an oven-like structure around the fire. You can place food like meat, fish, vegetables, and even bread on the hot stones to cook them. This method relies on the heat from the fire to cook the food.",
    "**River Rock Cooking:** If you're near a river or have access to large stones, you can use these as makeshift cooking surfaces. Place stones in a row and use them as a flat surface for cooking food over an open flame or a fire. For example, you could lay fish or meat on top of the stones, which will transfer the heat and cook the food evenly.",
    "**Earthen Pottery Cooking:** If you can create or find pottery, you can make simple pots out of clay or other natural materials. These pots can be placed directly on the fire or buried in the ground next to the heat source. Fill the pots with water, food, and any necessary seasonings, then cover the pot with a lid made from another piece of clay or a flat stone. The steam and heat generated inside the pot will cook the food.",
    "**Smokehouse Method:** Without electricity, you can still utilize the concept of a smokehouse to preserve and cook food. Find a sheltered area where you can hang meat, fish, or vegetables outside. Use wood or other natural materials to create a controlled smoke environment. The smoke acts as a natural preservative and adds flavor to the food, while the heat from the smoldering wood slowly cooks the ingredients.",
    "**Solar Cooker:** Build a simple solar cooker using materials like aluminum foil, cardboard, and plastic wrap. Create a box with a reflective surface (aluminum foil) on the bottom and sides and a clear top (plastic wrap). This design traps the sun's rays, heating the contents inside. Place food like rice, beans, or vegetables in the center of the cooker and cover with a lid (like a plastic container or another piece of cardboard). The concentrated sunlight will cook the food within hours, depending on the strength of the sun and the efficiency of the cooker."
