    "**Integrated Health Monitoring Sensors**: Create a computer mouse that includes built-in health monitoring sensors to track users' hand posture, movement patterns, and even stress levels. By using haptic feedback or visual indicators, the mouse could alert users when they are holding it incorrectly or need to take a break, promoting better ergonomics and overall health. This feature could be complemented by an accompanying app that provides insights and recommendations for healthier computing habits.",
    "**Smart Gesture Recognition**: Innovate a mouse that incorporates gesture recognition technology, allowing users to perform complex commands through hand movements. For example, users could swipe their hand above the mouse to scroll, pinch to zoom, or wave to switch between applications. This would not only enhance productivity but also provide a more interactive experience, making it easier for users to navigate their digital environments without relying solely on clicks.",
    "**Customizable RGB Lighting and Visual Feedback**: Design a mouse that features customizable RGB lighting, which can be programmed to respond to various actions or notifications. For instance, the mouse could change colors when receiving a new email, alerting the user without distracting them from their work. Additionally, the lighting could be adjusted to reflect different profiles (work, gaming, casual) or user preferences, making the mouse a stylish accessory as well as a functional tool.",
    "**Built-in Wireless Charging and Battery Management**: Develop a mouse that utilizes wireless charging technology, eliminating the need for batteries or cables. Users could simply place the mouse on a charging pad when not in use, ensuring it is always charged and ready to go. To further enhance this feature, integrate smart battery management that provides users with real-time battery status and alerts them when the charge is low, so they never experience unexpected downtime.",
    "**Multi-Device Connectivity with Smart Switching**: Create a mouse that can connect to multiple devices simultaneously and switch between them seamlessly. Users could easily toggle between their laptop, tablet, and smartphone with a simple button press or gesture. This feature would be especially beneficial for those who work across different platforms, providing a more fluid workflow without the hassle of reconnecting each time they switch devices."
