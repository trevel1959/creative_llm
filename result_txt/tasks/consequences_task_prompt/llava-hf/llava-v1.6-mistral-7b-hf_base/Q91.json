    "Transportation Disruptions: Vehicles would no longer be able to operate as they do now. Cars, trains, and airplanes would all have to be redesigned to account for the reversed gravity.",
    "Gravity-Defying Structures: Buildings and other structures would have to be redesigned to withstand the weight of the Earth's atmosphere.",
    "Health Issues: The human body is not designed to withstand the force of gravity pulling upwards. People would experience dizziness, nausea, and other health issues.",
    "Animal Behavior: Animals would also have to adapt to the new gravity. Birds would fly upwards and fish would swim upwards.",
    "Gravity-Powered Machines: Reversed gravity could be harnessed to create new types of machines that use gravity to move objects, such as gravity-powered cars or elevators."
