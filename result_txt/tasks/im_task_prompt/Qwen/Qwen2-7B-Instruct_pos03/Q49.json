    "**Customizable Oral Care Experience:** Design an electric toothbrush that can be customized to suit individual oral care needs. This could include different brush heads for various teeth sensitivity levels (e.g., sensitive, normal, or deep cleaning), adjustable brushing intensity, and customizable vibration patterns. Users could select these preferences through a mobile app that syncs with their toothbrush via Bluetooth. ",
    "**Teeth Whitening Kit Integration:** Integrate a teeth whitening kit into the electric toothbrush design. The toothbrush could come with replaceable brush heads that contain activated charcoal or other natural whitening agents. These brush heads would be used in conjunction with a dedicated whitening gel or paste. A smartphone app could guide users on how often to use the whitening brush head and provide progress tracking.",
    "**Smart Hygiene Tracker:** Develop an electric toothbrush that incorporates a smart sensor system. The sensor can track not only brushing time but also brushing pressure, angles of tooth brushing, and even gum health. Data collected from this sensor could be sent to a mobile app where users receive personalized feedback, tips, and reminders to improve their oral hygiene routine. This feature could help users avoid common brushing mistakes and promote healthier teeth and gums.",
    "**Innovative Brush Head Design:** Create a toothbrush with innovative brush head designs such as a rotating brush head that moves in a circular motion to mimic the natural motion of human fingers during brushing. This could enhance plaque removal efficiency while being gentler on the gums compared to traditional oscillating brushes. Additionally, consider incorporating micro-fiber bristles for improved cleaning and gentle polishing.",
    "**Integrating AI for Personalized Feedback:** Develop an electric toothbrush that utilizes AI technology to analyze brushing habits and provide personalized feedback. The toothbrush could learn user preferences over time and suggest adjustments to the brushing technique based on individual mouth characteristics. This could include identifying areas of the mouth that are brushed less frequently or recommending specific brushing techniques for particular teeth. The AI could also suggest new dental care products or routines tailored to the user's needs."
