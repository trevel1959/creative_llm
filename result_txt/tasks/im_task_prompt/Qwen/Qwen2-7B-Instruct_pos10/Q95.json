    "**Smart Laundry Basket**: Develop a smart laundry basket that uses sensors to detect the type of fabric and recommend the most suitable washing cycle for each item. The basket could also alert you when the load is full or when detergent is running low. It could even integrate with your smart home system to optimize energy usage.",
    "**Portable Laundry Basket with Built-in Dryer**: Create a compact, foldable laundry basket that doubles as a small electric dryer. The basket features a fan and heating element that can quickly dry clothes after they are washed. This would be particularly useful for those who live in apartments without space for separate laundry rooms.",
    "**Eco-Friendly Laundry Basket**: Design a laundry basket made from sustainable materials like bamboo or recycled plastic. This basket could be designed with compartments for different types of clothing (e.g., whites, darks, delicates) to help reduce water and energy usage during washing. Additionally, it could include a built-in filter to capture lint, reducing the need for additional cleaning of the washing machine.",
    "**Personalized Laundry Basket with Memory Functions**: Build a laundry basket with memory functions that allows users to save their preferred washing settings (e.g., water temperature, detergent amount, drying time). This feature would make it easy for family members to use the basket without having to adjust settings every time, ensuring consistent care for all garments.",
    "**Laundry Basket with Built-in Organizer and Storage**: Incorporate a modular design into the laundry basket, allowing users to add or remove compartments for sorting items by color, fabric type, or washing instructions. The basket could also include additional storage pockets for laundry supplies like detergent, softener packets, or dryer sheets, keeping everything organized and easily accessible."
