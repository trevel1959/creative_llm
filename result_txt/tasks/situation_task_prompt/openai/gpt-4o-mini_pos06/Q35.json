    "**Personal Electric Unicycle (PEU)**: Innovate a personal electric unicycle that balances itself using advanced gyroscopic technology. This device would be compact and portable, allowing users to easily carry it onto public transport or store it in small spaces. With a top speed suitable for city travel and a range of around 20 miles, it could serve as a unique and agile mode of transportation.",
    "**Mobile Solar-Powered Pods**: Create solar-powered mobile pods that can be reserved via an app. These pods would be small, self-driving units that pick up users at their location and take them to their destination. They would operate in a shared economy model, reducing the need for personal vehicles while harnessing renewable energy for travel.",
    "**Walking Robot Companions**: Imagine a future where small, autonomous walking robots accompany individuals to their destinations. Users could summon these robots through an app, and they would navigate through pedestrian pathways, helping carry items and providing companionship during the journey. This would not only facilitate movement but also promote social interaction in urban areas.",
    "**Augmented Reality Navigation Shoes**: Design smart shoes equipped with augmented reality (AR) technology that guides wearers through their surroundings. By projecting directions and information onto the ground in front of them, these shoes would enhance walking experiences and make it easier for people to explore new areas without getting lost.",
    "**Community-Based Pedestrian Trams**: Establish a network of small, community-operated pedestrian trams that run on designated routes throughout urban areas. These trams could be powered by renewable energy and offer free or low-cost rides. They would encourage walking and reduce congestion while providing a comfortable and social travel option for residents."
