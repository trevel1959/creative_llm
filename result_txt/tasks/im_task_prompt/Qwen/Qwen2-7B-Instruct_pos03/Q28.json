    "**Innovative Lighting System:** Develop a bicycle helmet that integrates advanced lighting technology for enhanced safety during night-time or low-light rides. The helmet could feature an array of LEDs that dynamically adjust their intensity based on the rider's speed and the brightness of the environment. The helmet might also include sensors to detect the presence of other vehicles or pedestrians, triggering the lights to flash more intensely for added visibility.",
    "**Hybrid Cooling and Protection:** Create a helmet that combines traditional protective features with innovative cooling technology to keep riders comfortable in hot weather. This could involve integrating a small, compact air conditioning unit into the helmet design, which would cool the interior by drawing in cooler air from outside and circulating it throughout the helmet. The cooling system could be powered by the bike's battery or a small, rechargeable battery pack.",
    "**Personalized Comfort Adjustment:** Develop a helmet that allows for customized fit and comfort using advanced materials and technologies. This helmet could incorporate a 3D scanning system that quickly maps the rider's head shape and creates a custom mold for the helmet's interior padding. The padding could be made from memory foam or a similar material that adapts to the rider's head shape over time, providing a snug and comfortable fit.",
    "**Integrated Health Monitoring:** Design a helmet that includes health monitoring features, such as heart rate monitors, blood oxygen saturation levels, and even basic fitness tracking capabilities. This would enable cyclists to monitor their physical condition during rides and receive real-time feedback on their performance. The data could be transmitted wirelessly to a smartphone app or a smartwatch for analysis and tracking.",
    "**Sustainability and Recyclability:** Create a bicycle helmet that is environmentally friendly, using sustainable materials and manufacturing processes. This helmet could be made from recycled plastics, organic fabrics, or biodegradable materials. Additionally, the helmet could be designed with a modular construction, allowing parts to be easily replaced when they wear out or become damaged. A recycling program could also be established to encourage customers to return old helmets for proper disposal and recycling, reducing waste and promoting sustainability."
