    "**Language Barriers and Translation Services**: Language differences can pose significant challenges during international meetings. To address this, organizers should hire professional interpreters fluent in the delegates' languages and provide real-time translation services. Additionally, pre-summit materials should be translated into multiple languages to ensure that all participants are well-prepared and can contribute meaningfully to discussions.",
    "**Sustainable Venue Selection**: Choosing a venue that aligns with the summit's values of peace and sustainability is crucial. Organizers should prioritize locations that practice environmental responsibility, such as using renewable energy sources, minimizing waste, and promoting local biodiversity. This not only sets a positive example but also ensures that the summit itself does not contribute to environmental degradation, reinforcing the message of global stewardship.",
    "**Security Concerns and Protocols**: Given the high-profile nature of an international peace summit, security is a top priority. Organizers must collaborate with local law enforcement and security agencies to develop comprehensive security protocols. This includes background checks for attendees, secure transportation arrangements, and emergency response plans. Additionally, a focus on cybersecurity measures is essential to protect sensitive discussions and information from potential threats.",
    "**Conflict Resolution Mechanisms**: Organizers should anticipate potential disagreements among delegates and establish clear conflict resolution mechanisms before the summit begins. This could involve appointing a neutral mediator who can facilitate discussions and help parties find common ground. By having a structured approach to resolving conflicts, the summit can maintain a focus on collaboration and dialogue, rather than allowing tensions to escalate.",
    "**Inclusive Participation and Representation**: To ensure that the summit reflects a truly global perspective, organizers should actively seek to include voices from underrepresented groups, such as women, youth, and marginalized communities. This can be achieved through targeted outreach efforts, scholarships for delegates from low-income countries, and dedicated panels that focus on issues pertinent to these groups. By fostering inclusivity, the summit can generate a more comprehensive understanding of global peace challenges."
