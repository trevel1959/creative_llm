    "**Incorporate Sleep Meditation:** Since you'd be unable to sleep during the day due to lack of darkness, consider turning your sleep time into a meditation practice. This could involve deep breathing exercises, visualization techniques, or guided imagery. You can create a peaceful environment, perhaps with soft music or soothing sounds like rain or ocean waves, to help you relax and 'sleep' through the day. This not only helps in managing the lack of night but also enhances your mental well-being.",
    "**Daytime Reading Lamps:** Invest in high-quality, adjustable reading lamps that can mimic natural sunlight. By doing so, you can create an artificial \"night\" atmosphere during the day for sleeping. These lamps will provide a comfortable, dim light that promotes relaxation, helping you fall asleep easier when the daylight is still around.",
    "**Daytime Yoga or Exercise Routine:** Engage in regular physical activities like yoga, stretching, or even light cardio. Not only does exercise help improve sleep quality, but it also helps you manage stress and boredom. You could create a daily routine that includes a variety of exercises, ensuring you're both physically and mentally stimulated throughout the day.",
    "**Create a Daytime \"Dreamscape\":** Transform your living space or bedroom into a serene, dreamy environment during the day. Use calming colors, soft lighting, and comfortable bedding to encourage restful \"sleep.\" Incorporate elements like scented candles or essential oils to enhance the relaxing atmosphere. Additionally, play soothing music or nature sounds to further promote a sense of calm and tranquility.",
    "**Sleep Technology and Apps:** Utilize technology designed to improve sleep quality. Try out sleep-tracking apps or devices that monitor your sleep patterns and offer personalized recommendations. These tools can help you understand your sleep cycle better, allowing you to make adjustments to your daytime habits and ensure you're getting adequate rest. Incorporating smart lights or wearable sleep monitors can also help you simulate nighttime conditions and optimize your sleep experience during the day."
