    "A  sustainable city  with a self-sustaining ecosystem, where buildings are covered in greenery and have solar panels, and there are no cars or pollution. I would draw this first because it would be amazing to see a place where humans and nature coexist in harmony, and it would be a great solution to the environmental problems we face today. The city would be powered by renewable energy, and the buildings would be designed to minimize waste and maximize efficiency. It would be a place where people could live in peace and prosperity, surrounded by nature and beauty.",
    "A  library that contains every book ever written, and where people can access any information they need. I would draw this second because it would be incredible to have access to all the knowledge and wisdom of humanity at our fingertips. The library would be a place where people could come to learn, grow, and explore new ideas, and it would be a treasure trove of human knowledge and experience. It would be a place where people could come to discover new things, challenge their assumptions, and expand their horizons.",
    "A  machine that can heal any disease or injury, and restore people to full health. I would draw this third because it would be amazing to see people living free from pain and suffering, and to know that we have the power to cure any illness or injury. The machine would be a game-changer for medicine and healthcare, and it would give people hope and new possibilities for the future.",
    "A  device that can translate any language in real-time, and allow people to communicate with each other across cultural and linguistic boundaries. I would draw this fourth because it would be incredible to be able to communicate with people from different cultures and backgrounds, and to be able to understand and appreciate their perspectives and experiences. The device would be a tool for building bridges and fostering understanding and cooperation between people from different parts of the world.",
    "A  virtual reality world that is indistinguishable from reality, and where people can live out their fantasies and dreams in a completely immersive and interactive environment. I would draw this fifth because it would be amazing to be able to experience new worlds and possibilities in a completely new and exciting way. The virtual reality world would be a place where people could come to escape the stresses and challenges of everyday life, and to explore new ideas and possibilities in a safe and controlled environment."
