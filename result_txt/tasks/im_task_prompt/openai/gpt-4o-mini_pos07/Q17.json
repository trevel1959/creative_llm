    "**Eco-Friendly Detergent Dispenser**: Design a built-in dispenser that uses biodegradable capsules or pods filled with eco-friendly detergent. The machine could analyze the load size and type to release the exact amount of detergent needed, minimizing waste and promoting sustainable washing practices. Additionally, the machine could have a feature that recommends local eco-friendly detergent brands based on user preferences.",
    "**Self-Cleaning Mechanism**: Introduce a self-cleaning feature that uses steam and specialized cleaning agents to sanitize the drum and hoses after each wash cycle. This would help prevent mold, mildew, and odor buildup, ensuring that the washing machine remains hygienic and operates efficiently over time without the need for manual cleaning.",
    "**Virtual Reality User Interface**: Create a virtual reality (VR) interface for the washing machine that allows users to customize their washing experience in an immersive environment. Users could select wash cycles, adjust settings, and visualize how different options would affect their laundry in a 3D space. This could make the process more engaging and user-friendly, especially for tech-savvy individuals.",
    "**Laundry Folding Robot Integration**: Develop a companion robot that works in tandem with the washing machine to fold clean laundry. Once the washing and drying cycles are complete, the robot could automatically retrieve the clothes from the dryer and neatly fold them, providing a seamless laundry experience and saving users time and effort.",
    "**Built-In Water Recycling System**: Implement a water recycling feature that captures and purifies water used in washing cycles. This system could filter out contaminants and allow the machine to reuse water for subsequent loads, significantly reducing water consumption. Users could monitor their water savings through an app, encouraging eco-friendly habits."
