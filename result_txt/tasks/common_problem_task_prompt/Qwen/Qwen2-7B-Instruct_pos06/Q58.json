    "**Blockchain-based Authentication System**: This idea leverages the decentralized and secure nature of blockchain technology to create a robust authentication system for the multinational company. Employees can use their blockchain wallets as a multi-factor authentication method, which would significantly enhance the security of the system. The wallet could also serve as a digital identity card, containing information like the user's name, role within the organization, and access permissions. This approach not only strengthens security but also simplifies the onboarding process for new employees. **Confidence Score: 0.95**",
    "**AI-Powered Anomaly Detection**: Implement an AI-driven system that constantly monitors network traffic and user behavior patterns. This solution uses machine learning algorithms to identify deviations from normal activity, alerting security teams to potential threats in real-time. The system can learn from past attacks and adapt its detection methods accordingly, making it more effective over time. **Confidence Score: 0.9**",
    "**Multi-Tiered Zero Trust Architecture**: Adopt a zero-trust security model where all users and devices are initially considered untrusted until proven otherwise. This architecture involves creating multiple layers of defense at different points in the network. For instance, the outer layer could involve perimeter defenses like firewalls and intrusion detection systems, while inner layers could include device trust verification, user authentication, and application access controls. **Confidence Score: 0.85**",
    "**Phishing Simulation Training**: Develop a comprehensive phishing simulation program that trains employees to recognize and avoid malicious emails and links. The training includes realistic scenarios and regular assessments to test employees' knowledge and response. The program should provide feedback and reinforcement to improve employee awareness and reduce the risk of successful phishing attacks. **Confidence Score: 0.9**",
    "**Cybersecurity Incident Response Playbook**: Create a detailed incident response playbook that outlines steps for detecting, investigating, containing, and recovering from cybersecurity incidents. This playbook should be accessible to all relevant stakeholders and updated regularly based on new threats and lessons learned from previous incidents. Regular drills should be conducted to ensure that all employees understand their roles and responsibilities during a security breach. **Confidence Score: 0.9**"
