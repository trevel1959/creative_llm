    "**Self-Cleaning Interior with Eco-Friendly Solutions**: Develop a self-cleaning oven that utilizes eco-friendly steam technology. When activated, the oven would generate steam that loosens grime and food residues. Users could then simply wipe the interior with a cloth, reducing the need for harsh chemicals and making cleaning more efficient and environmentally friendly.",
    "**Multi-Function Cooking Modes**: Create an oven with customizable cooking modes that can be programmed for specific dishes. For example, a \"pizza mode\" could use a combination of bottom heat and top broil for optimal crust and cheese melting, while a \"baking mode\" would ensure even heat distribution for cakes and bread. Users could also create and save their own cooking profiles for future use.",
    "**Integrated Air Fryer Technology**: Incorporate air fryer technology into the oven, allowing users to switch between traditional baking and air frying with a simple setting change. This would enable healthier cooking options, giving users the ability to achieve crispy textures without the need for excessive oil, all while using the same appliance.",
    "**Augmented Reality Cooking Assistant**: Introduce an augmented reality (AR) feature that provides step-by-step cooking guidance through a smart device or glasses. When users look at the oven, they would see overlays that indicate temperature settings, cooking times, and even visual cues for when to check or flip their food. This would enhance the cooking experience and reduce the chances of errors.",
    "**Voice-Activated Control System**: Equip the oven with a voice-activated control system that allows users to operate it hands-free. Users could simply say commands like \"preheat to 350 degrees\" or \"set timer for 20 minutes,\" making it easier to multitask in the kitchen, especially when hands are busy with food preparation."
