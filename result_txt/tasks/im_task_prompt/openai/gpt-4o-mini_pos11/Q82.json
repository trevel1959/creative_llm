    "**Self-Cleaning Socks**: Utilize nanotechnology to create a fabric that actively repels dirt and moisture, preventing odors and stains. The socks could be treated with a special coating that breaks down bacteria and grime when exposed to sunlight or specific wavelengths of light. This would reduce the need for frequent washing and extend the lifespan of the socks.",
    "**Mood-Enhancing Socks**: Design socks with embedded LED lights that change color based on the wearer’s mood or environment. Using a smartphone app, users can select colors that reflect their feelings or create patterns that respond to their movements. This not only adds a fun aesthetic but also serves as a form of self-expression and can uplift the wearer’s mood.",
    "**Ergonomic Support Socks**: Create socks with built-in arch support and cushioning that adapt to the foot's shape. By using a combination of memory foam and elastic materials, these socks would provide targeted support where needed, reducing foot fatigue during long periods of standing or walking. This design would appeal to professionals who are on their feet all day, such as nurses or retail workers.",
    "**Modular Socks**: Develop socks with detachable and interchangeable parts. For instance, the toe section could be swapped out for different materials (like wool for warmth or mesh for breathability), and the ankle section could be modified for various heights or designs. This would allow users to customize their socks for different occasions, from casual to formal, while reducing the number of pairs they need to own.",
    "**Integrated Compression Technology**: Innovate socks that feature adjustable compression zones, allowing users to customize the level of compression based on their activity. Athletes could benefit from enhanced blood circulation during workouts, while individuals with circulatory issues could use them for comfort and support. This could be achieved through a simple mechanism, such as tightening or loosening a built-in lacing system."
