    "**Eco-Friendly Printing Mode**: Introduce a built-in eco mode that automatically adjusts settings to save energy and resources. This mode would reduce the printer's power consumption when idle, use double-sided printing by default, and alert users when they're about to print on paper that has already been used on one side. The printer could also provide a summary of resources saved after each printing session.",
    "**Integrated Document Scanner with OCR**: Create a multifunction printer that features an advanced document scanner capable of Optical Character Recognition (OCR). This would allow users to scan physical documents and convert them into editable text files automatically. The printer could also organize scanned documents into digital folders based on user-defined criteria, streamlining document management.",
    "**Augmented Reality Printing Preview**: Design a companion app that uses augmented reality (AR) to give users a real-time preview of their printed materials. By pointing their smartphone or tablet at the area where they plan to print, users could visualize how the printed item will look in that space, helping them make adjustments to layout, color, and design before committing to print.",
    "**Personalized Print Templates**: Offer a library of customizable print templates that can be accessed via a cloud-based service. Users could select templates for various needs—such as business cards, invitations, or flyers—and personalize them directly from their devices. The printer would sync with the user’s account to pull in the latest designs and settings, making the printing process seamless and creative.",
    "**Voice-Controlled Printing**: Integrate voice recognition technology into printers, allowing users to issue commands via smart assistants like Alexa or Google Assistant. Users could say commands like \"Print my latest document\" or \"Print my grocery list,\" and the printer would execute the task without needing to access a computer or smartphone. This feature would enhance convenience, especially in busy households or offices."
