    "**Multi-Functional Knife with Modular Attachments**: Create a knife with interchangeable blades and attachments that can transform it into various kitchen tools. For instance, users could switch from a chefâ€™s knife blade to a serrated blade for bread, or attach a peeler or zester. This would save space in the kitchen and provide versatility without needing multiple tools.",
    "**Self-Sharpening Knife Technology**: Develop a knife that features a built-in self-sharpening mechanism. The knife would have a ceramic or diamond sharpening edge integrated into the handle, which automatically sharpens the blade each time it is sheathed. This would ensure that the knife remains sharp without requiring manual sharpening, making it more convenient for everyday use.",
    "**Ergonomically Designed Handle with Temperature Control**: Design a knife with a handle that adjusts its temperature based on the user's preference. This feature could warm up slightly for comfort during cold weather or cool down in hot conditions. The ergonomic design would also include textured grips to enhance comfort and prevent slipping, reducing the risk of accidents while cutting.",
    "**Knife with Built-in LED Light and Magnifier**: Create a knife that has a small LED light integrated into the blade that illuminates the cutting area, making it easier to see what you are slicing, especially in dim lighting. Additionally, a small magnifying glass could be incorporated into the handle, allowing users to inspect their ingredients closely for any imperfections or details that need attention.",
    "**Knife with Recipe Integration and Smart Display**: Imagine a knife that features a small digital display on the handle, which shows recipes, cooking tips, or timers while you cook. This knife could connect to a smart kitchen assistant, allowing users to follow recipes step-by-step while keeping their hands free. It could also include voice commands to navigate through different functions."
