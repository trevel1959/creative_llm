    "Create a solar-powered shelter: With no electricity to rely on, it's important to find alternative sources of energy. One way to do this is by creating a shelter that can harness the power of the sun. This could be done by building a structure made of lightweight materials like bamboo or plastic, which would allow for maximum absorption of sunlight. The shelter could also have windows that face south to maximize exposure to the sun.",
    "Use fire for warmth and cooking: In the absence of electricity, fire becomes an essential source of warmth and light. To start a fire, one could use dry leaves, twigs, and kindling, which are readily available in nature. Once started, the fire can be used to cook food, boil water, and provide warmth.",
    "Build a rainwater harvesting system: Without access to running water, it's important to find ways to collect and store rainwater. This can be done by building a simple rainwater harvesting system using materials like plastic sheeting and gutters. The collected water can then be used for drinking, washing, and other household needs.",
    "Grow your own food: Without access to electricity, it's difficult to grow crops indoors or use electric-powered gardening tools. However, one can still grow their own food by using traditional farming methods such as hand-picking seeds, planting in soil, and using natural fertilizers. It's important to choose plants that can thrive in low-light conditions and don't require much maintenance.",
    "Develop survival skills: In the event of a power outage, it's important to have basic survival skills such as finding food and water, building shelter, starting fires, and navigating through unfamiliar terrain. By practicing these skills regularly, one can increase their chances of surviving in challenging situations without relying on electricity."
