    "**Creating Universal Mental Health Literacy Programs**: If a cure for all mental illnesses is discovered, it's crucial that society adapts to this change by implementing universal mental health literacy programs. This could involve creating comprehensive education in schools and workplaces about mental health, including signs, symptoms, and how to support those experiencing mental health issues. The idea here is to ensure that people are not only aware of mental illnesses but also equipped with the tools to offer help and reduce stigma.",
    "**Mental Health as a Public Service**: Just like access to healthcare, access to mental health care could be considered a public service, provided by the government or large corporations to their employees. This could include offering free or low-cost therapy sessions, mental health days, and mental health awareness training for employers. The goal is to make mental health care accessible to everyone, regardless of their financial status, and to foster an environment where discussing mental health is normalized.",
    "**Revolutionizing Employment Policies**: Companies could adopt new policies that prioritize mental health just as they do physical health. This could include flexible work hours, remote work options, and providing mental health resources within the workplace. For example, companies might offer partnerships with mental health professionals or on-site counseling services. This could significantly reduce the burden of mental health issues on individuals and improve overall productivity and job satisfaction.",
    "**Incorporating Mental Health into Education Systems**: With a cure in place, education systems could be reformed to include mental health as a core component of the curriculum. This would involve teaching students not only academic subjects but also emotional intelligence, stress management techniques, and coping strategies. By embedding these skills early in life, children could develop resilience and better handle the pressures of growing up and facing real-world challenges.",
    "**Cultural Shift Through Media and Entertainment**: The entertainment industry has immense power in shaping societal norms and attitudes. By incorporating more stories and characters dealing openly and positively with mental health issues, media can play a crucial role in changing perceptions and reducing stigma. This could include films, TV shows, books, and video games that depict mental health conditions in a nuanced and empathetic way, helping to normalize discussions around mental health and encouraging people to seek help when needed."
