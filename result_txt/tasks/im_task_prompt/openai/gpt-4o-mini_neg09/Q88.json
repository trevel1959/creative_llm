    "**Adjustable Length with Memory Function**: Create ski poles that can automatically adjust their length based on the skier's height and preferred skiing style. Utilizing a memory function, the poles would remember the user's settings and automatically extend or retract based on the terrain, whether for downhill skiing or cross-country skiing.",
    "**Ergonomic Grip with Temperature Control**: Design ski poles with an ergonomic grip that features temperature control. Using built-in heating elements, the grips could warm up in cold weather, ensuring comfort and reducing the risk of frostbite. Alternatively, they could have cooling features for warmer days, providing a comfortable grip regardless of the temperature.",
    "**Interchangeable Tips for Different Terrains**: Develop ski poles with interchangeable tips that can be swapped out depending on the skiing conditions. For example, users could have a sharp tip for icy conditions, a wider tip for powder, and a rubber tip for use on hard-packed trails. This would allow skiers to optimize their performance based on the terrain.",
    "**Integrated Safety Features**: Incorporate safety features such as an avalanche beacon or a whistle into the ski poles. The beacon could help rescuers locate skiers in case of an avalanche, while the whistle could be used to signal for help in emergencies. Additionally, the poles could have reflective materials to enhance visibility in low-light conditions.",
    "**Built-in Audio System**: Equip ski poles with a lightweight, waterproof audio system that allows skiers to listen to music or receive navigation instructions via Bluetooth. This would provide an immersive skiing experience without the need for bulky headphones. The audio could also include safety alerts or reminders to take breaks."
