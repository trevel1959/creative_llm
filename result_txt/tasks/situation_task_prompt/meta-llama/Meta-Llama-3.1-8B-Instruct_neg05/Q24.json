    "**Smart Contact Implants**: In a world without glasses or contact lenses, people with poor vision could opt for a revolutionary new technology - smart contact implants. These tiny, almost-invisible devices would be inserted into the eye, using advanced nanotechnology to correct vision and even enhance it. The implants would be powered by a small, implantable battery that could be recharged wirelessly, ensuring a seamless and hassle-free experience for the user.",
    "**Augmented Reality Eyewear**: The disappearance of glasses and contact lenses could lead to the rise of augmented reality (AR) eyewear. These cutting-edge devices would use advanced computer vision and machine learning algorithms to enhance the user's vision, providing real-time information and assistance. AR eyewear could display text, images, and even virtual objects, making it easier for people with poor vision to navigate their surroundings.",
    "**Personalized Optics**: In a world without glasses or contact lenses, people with poor vision could rely on personalized optics - a bespoke solution that uses 3D printing and advanced materials to create custom lenses that fit perfectly within the eye. These lenses would be tailored to the individual's specific vision needs, providing unparalleled clarity and comfort.",
    "**Brain-Computer Interface (BCI) Vision**: The absence of glasses and contact lenses could lead to the development of brain-computer interface (BCI) technology that allows people with poor vision to \"see\" through their brain activity. BCIs would use electroencephalography (EEG) or other techniques to decode brain signals, translating them into visual information that the user can perceive.",
    "**Swarm Robotics Vision Assistants**: In a world without glasses or contact lenses, people with poor vision could be aided by swarm robotics vision assistants - a fleet of tiny, autonomous robots that swarm around the user, providing real-time visual information and assistance. These robots would use advanced computer vision and machine learning algorithms to navigate and interpret the environment, helping the user to navigate with ease."
