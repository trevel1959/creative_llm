    "**Smart Sweater with Integrated Health Monitoring**: Imagine a sweater equipped with smart textiles that can monitor vital signs like heart rate, temperature, and stress levels. Using built-in sensors, the sweater could send data to a connected app, alerting the wearer if their vitals indicate stress or fatigue. It could even suggest breathing exercises or mindfulness techniques based on real-time data, promoting overall well-being.",
    "**Modular Sweater with Interchangeable Components**: This design would feature a base sweater with detachable sleeves, collars, and hems that can be swapped out to create different looks. Each component could be designed in various patterns, colors, and textures, allowing wearers to customize their outfit based on the occasion or their mood. This would not only promote creativity in fashion but also reduce waste by encouraging consumers to invest in fewer, more versatile pieces.",
    "**Self-Cleaning Sweater**: Utilizing advanced nanotechnology, this sweater would be treated with a self-cleaning coating that repels dirt and stains. When exposed to sunlight or a specific wavelength of light, the fabric would break down organic materials, keeping the sweater fresh and clean without the need for frequent washing. This would save water, reduce laundry-related wear and tear, and be environmentally friendly.",
    "**Temperature-Regulating Sweater**: This sweater would incorporate phase change materials (PCMs) that absorb, store, and release heat according to the wearer's body temperature. It would keep the wearer warm in cold conditions and cool in warmer weather, providing comfort without the need for multiple layers. This would be especially useful for people who transition between different environments throughout the day.",
    "**Interactive Story Sweater**: This unique sweater would come with a built-in QR code or NFC chip that links to an interactive story or a digital art experience. As wearers go about their day, they can scan their sweater with a smartphone to unlock new chapters of a story or reveal augmented reality animations. This concept would blend fashion with storytelling, making the sweater a canvas for creativity and personal expression."
