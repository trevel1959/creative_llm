    "Automated Tracking: Install GPS and sensors into the shopping cart. This feature would allow the store to track customer movement and optimize inventory levels accordingly. By tracking where aisles are the most frequently visited and where carts are the least frequently returned, the store can make data-driven decisions about inventory placement, restocking, and replenishment.",
    "Green Cart: Transform the shopping cart into a green option by incorporating eco-friendly, water-resistant materials and replace non-renewable plastics with biodegradable, compostable, or recyclable materials. Additionally, offer options for customers to collect and dispose of expired or unwanted food items at designated drop-off points.",
    "Accessory Power Bank: Attach a small power bank to the shopping cart. With a rechargeable power bank, customers can charge their smartphones and other electronic devices while they shop. This could be especially useful for busy families or people traveling along with their shopping trip.",
    "Smart Cart 2.0: Enhance the smart cart by adding voice recognition technology. This would allow customers to say \"add to cart,\" \"remove,\" or \"clear cart\" without needing to touch the device. The voice control could also navigate the aisle for assistance.",
    "Personalized Pricing and Offers: Implement a loyalty program that offers personalized pricing and promotional offers to customers when they have the shopping cart. The system would use their shopping history, preferences, and demographic data to recommend targeted promotions and discounts based on their purchases."
