    "In a small town, a group of friends decided to throw an invisible birthday party for their introverted friend, Mia, who always felt overshadowed by more outgoing personalities. They sent out invites with instructions to wear invisible ink and bring invisible gifts. On the day of the party, they gathered in a park, pretending to celebrate. They played games, shared laughter, and even cut an imaginary cake. Mia arrived, confused but intrigued by the atmosphere. As she joined in, she realized that their love and effort made her feel more visible than ever. The invisible party became a cherished memory, proving that friendship transcends visibility.",
