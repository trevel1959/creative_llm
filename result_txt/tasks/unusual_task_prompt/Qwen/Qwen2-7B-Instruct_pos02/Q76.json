    "**Innovative Marketing Campaigns:** Develop a unique marketing campaign that leverages emerging technologies such as augmented reality (AR) or virtual reality (VR).

This could be especially impactful for fashion, beauty, or tech brands.",
    "**Sustainable Product Line:** Create a line of products that not only meets the current market demand but also addresses future environmental concerns.
