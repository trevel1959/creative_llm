    "A drop in oxygen levels. Oxygen is produced through photosynthesis, so without sunlight, the amount of oxygen in the atmosphere would decrease.",
    "An increase in temperature. While the sun is necessary for life on Earth, it also regulates the planet's temperature. Without the sun, Earth's temperature would drop, possibly to levels where it becomes uninhabitable.",
    "Changes in the magnetic field. The sun is responsible for creating Earth's magnetic field, which protects us from harmful solar radiation. If the sun disappeared, the magnetic field would weaken, and we would be exposed to increased radiation.",
    "Disruption of global weather patterns. The sun's heat drives weather patterns and ocean currents, which are crucial for regulating the Earth's climate. With no sun for a month, the balance of the Earth's atmosphere and weather patterns would be disrupted.",
    "A significant change in the moon's orbit. The sun's gravity keeps the Earth in its orbit, so without its presence, Earth's orbit could become unstable. This could cause the moon's orbit to shift or even change altogether."
