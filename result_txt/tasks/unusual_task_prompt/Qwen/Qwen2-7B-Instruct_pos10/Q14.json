    "**Smart Stapler with Automatic Replenishment**: Design a stapler that comes with a built-in sensor capable of detecting when staples are running low. Once the level drops below a certain point, the stapler automatically orders new staples online and sends them directly to your door. This would be a convenient solution for offices and individuals who often forget to stock up on staples.",
    "**Ergonomic Stapler with Adjustable Handle**: Create a stapler that is ergonomically designed to fit comfortably in various hand sizes and shapes. The handle can be adjusted to provide the most comfortable grip for different users, reducing strain and fatigue during use. This would be especially beneficial for people who need to staple large volumes of documents frequently.",
    "**Stapler with Built-in Document Organizer**: Integrate a stapler with a small tray or holder at the base where users can place and organize documents before stapling. This feature helps in maintaining order and can save time by ensuring that documents are ready for stapling without having to rearrange them afterward.",
    "**Wireless Charging Station for Mobile Devices**: Combine the functionality of a stapler with a wireless charging pad, allowing users to charge their smartphones or tablets while they're using the stapler. This innovative design caters to the growing trend of integrating technology into everyday items, making the workspace more efficient and convenient.",
    "**Voice-Activated Stapler**: Develop a stapler that can be controlled through voice commands, making it accessible for individuals with motor disabilities or those who prefer hands-free operation. This could include features like asking the stapler to \"open\", \"close\", or \"staple\" with specific documents. It would significantly enhance accessibility and user-friendliness."
