    "Create a fire-resistant habitat: Build a safe room or bunker in your home using fire-resistant materials like fireproof concrete, steel, or ceramic. This would provide a secure shelter for you and your family in case of a fire.",
    "Install a fire-starting kit: Create a kit with materials that can help you start a fire to signal for help in case of an emergency. This could include items like flares, mirrors, and a whistle. You can also include a fire starter like a lighter or matches.",
    "Create a fire-fighting team: Train your family and neighbors in basic fire-fighting techniques, such as using a fire extinguisher, covering escape routes, and evacuating the area. This way, you can create a team that can help put out small fires before they spread.",
    "Use natural fire-resistant materials: Incorporate natural fire-resistant materials like sand, clay, or stone into your home's design. These materials can help insulate your home from heat and flames, providing an extra layer of protection.",
    "Install a fire-detecting system: Create a system that detects fires early on, such as a smoke detector or a heat sensor. This can help alert you and your family to potential fires before they spread, giving you more time to evacuate or put out the fire."
