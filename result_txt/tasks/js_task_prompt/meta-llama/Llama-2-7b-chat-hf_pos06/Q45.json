    "A sense of smell for the eyes: A new human sense that would allow people to see and interpret the aromas around them. This sense would be called \"Opti-Nose\" and would work by using specialized photoreceptors in the retina to detect and interpret the chemical composition of scents. People with Opti-Nose would be able to \"see\" the subtle differences in aroma, allowing them to identify and distinguish between various fragrances, flavors, and environmental odors with unprecedented accuracy. Confidence Score: 0.8",
    "A sense of temperature: A new human sense that would allow people to perceive and interpret changes in temperature. This sense would be called \"Thermi-Sense\" and would work by using specialized thermoreceptors in the skin to detect even slight changes in temperature. People with Thermi-Sense would be able to detect subtle variations in the warmth or coolness of their surroundings, allowing them to better navigate their environment and respond to changes in temperature. Confidence Score: 0.9",
    "A sense of magnetoreception: A new human sense that would allow people to perceive and interpret magnetic fields. This sense would be called \"Magni-Sense\" and would work by using specialized magnetoreceptors in the body to detect the subtle changes in magnetic fields that occur in response to movement or location. People with Magni-Sense would be able to navigate more easily, detect hidden doors or secret passages, and even sense the presence of other people or objects based on their magnetic signature. Confidence Score: 0.95",
    "A sense of sound polarization: A new human sense that would allow people to perceive and interpret the orientation of sound waves. This sense would be called \"Polari-Ear\" and would work by using specialized polarizing filters in the inner ear to detect the orientation of sound waves. People with Polari-Ear would be able to locate the source of a sound more easily, and even perceive sounds that are not audible to the naked ear. Confidence Score: 0.85",
    "A sense of time dilation: A new human sense that would allow people to perceive and interpret the passage of time. This sense would be called \"Chrono-Sense\" and would work by"
