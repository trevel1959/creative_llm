    "In a lush jungle, there lived an elephant named Elara who had a peculiar conditionâ€”she forgot everything she learned each day. One morning, she woke up to find her friends planning a surprise party for her. As they whispered excitedly, Elara wandered off, forgetting the joy awaiting her. She spent the day meeting a parrot who taught her to dance, a monkey who showed her how to swing, and a wise tortoise who shared stories of the stars. When she returned, her friends greeted her with cheers. Though she had forgotten the party, she realized that every day was a new adventure, filled with friends and laughter.",
