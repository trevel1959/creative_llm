    "**Circadian Rhythm Chaos**: Without sleep, the human body's natural circadian rhythm would be severely disrupted. This could lead to a cascade of issues, including impaired glucose regulation, increased inflammation, and a weakened immune system. People might experience constant fatigue, irritability, and mood swings, making everyday life a struggle.",
    "**Sleep-Deprived Society Collapse**: As people struggle to cope with the loss of sleep, social structures and economies would likely crumble. Productivity would plummet, and critical infrastructure, such as healthcare and transportation systems, might fail. Governments might implement extreme measures, like curfews or forced sleep therapy, to maintain order.",
    "**Neurological Breakdown**: Prolonged sleep deprivation could lead to permanent damage to the brain, including reduced cognitive function, memory loss, and increased risk of neurodegenerative diseases like Alzheimer's and Parkinson's. This could result in a significant decline in human intelligence and innovation.",
    "**Dreams and the Subconscious**: Without sleep, the subconscious mind might become overwhelmed, leading to a surge in vivid, disturbing dreams and hallucinations. This could cause people to question their own sanity, leading to a rise in mental health issues and a breakdown in social cohesion.",
    "**Evolutionary Adaptation**: In the absence of sleep, humans might undergo a rapid evolutionary adaptation, with natural selection favoring individuals who can survive and thrive without rest. This could lead to the emergence of a new human subspecies, adapted to a sleepless lifestyle, with altered physiology and behavior. Over time, this could result in a fundamentally different human species, one that has abandoned the traditional sleep-wake cycle."
