    "The Law of Gravity - Confidence Score: 0.8",
    "Time-Dependent Gravity: What if the strength of the gravitational force between two objects depended on the amount of time they had spent together? This would create a kind of \"gravity memory,\" where objects that have been in close proximity for longer periods of time would be more strongly attracted to each other than those that have only recently come into contact.",
    "Gravitational Shielding: Imagine a world where certain objects or areas could shield themselves from the effects of gravity. This could be achieved through the use of advanced technology, such as gravitational fields or exotic matter, which would allow these objects or areas to float or even defy gravity altogether.",
    "Gravity Waves: Instead of being a constant, unchanging force, what if gravity could be manipulated through the use of gravitational waves? These waves could be generated by massive objects, such as black holes or neutron stars, and could be used to transmit information or even energy across vast distances.",
    "Quantum Gravity: At the quantum level, gravity is a fundamental force that governs the behavior of subatomic particles. What if we could manipulate this force to create new forms of energy or matter? For example, what if we could create stable, self-sustaining miniature black holes that could be used as sources of limitless energy?"
