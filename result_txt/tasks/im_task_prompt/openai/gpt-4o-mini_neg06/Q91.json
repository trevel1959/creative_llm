    "**QR Code for Instant Contact**: Create a luggage tag that includes a scannable QR code linking to a digital profile. This profile can include the owner's contact information, travel itinerary, and emergency contacts. If someone finds the luggage, they can easily scan the code to access the information and contact the owner without needing to call or email.",
    "**Customizable LED Display**: Introduce a luggage tag with a small LED screen that can display customizable messages or information. Owners could program their name, destination, or a fun message. This feature not only personalizes the tag but also makes it easier to identify the luggage on a crowded carousel.",
    "**Integrated RFID for Security**: Enhance luggage tags with RFID (Radio Frequency Identification) technology that can communicate with airport security systems. This would streamline the check-in process and help ensure that bags are properly tagged and accounted for, reducing the chances of theft or misplacement.",
    "**Eco-Friendly Materials**: Design luggage tags using sustainable materials such as recycled plastics or biodegradable substances. This would appeal to environmentally conscious travelers and contribute to reducing plastic waste. The tag could also feature a plantable seed paper that can be planted after use, growing into a plant or flower.",
    "**Built-in Scale**: Incorporate a small, lightweight scale into the luggage tag that allows travelers to weigh their bags before check-in. The scale could display the weight digitally on the tag, helping to avoid overweight baggage fees and ensuring compliance with airline regulations."
