    "**Integration of Technologies**: The robot may require the integration of various technologies such as sensors, actuators, and AI algorithms. A potential issue is compatibility among these technologies. For example, if the sensors cannot communicate effectively with the central processing unit due to differing protocols, the robot may not function as intended, resulting in wasted resources and time.",
    "**Programming Challenges**: Writing the software that controls the robot can be a daunting task. Bugs and glitches in the code can lead to unexpected behavior, such as erratic movements or failure to execute tasks. This can create a cycle of testing and debugging that slows down the overall progress of the project, causing frustration among team members.",
    "**Safety Concerns**: Depending on the robot's intended use, safety can be a significant issue. If the robot operates in a shared space with humans, there must be fail-safes to prevent accidents. For instance, if the robot has a malfunction and starts moving unpredictably, it could pose a risk to nearby individuals, leading to potential injuries and liability issues.",
    "**Resource Allocation**: Creating a robot requires significant resources, including time, money, and human expertise. A potential problem could be the misallocation of these resources. If the team underestimates the budget or the time required for certain phases of development, they may run out of funds or miss deadlines, jeopardizing the project's success.",
    "**User Acceptance**: If the robot is intended for public use, user acceptance can be a challenge. People may have reservations about interacting with robots, fearing job displacement or safety risks. Conducting thorough user research and testing can help mitigate this issue, but it requires additional time and effort that may not have been initially planned."
