    "**Visual Communication Tools**: Develop a set of visual communication tools such as infographics, charts, and pictograms to convey important information. This can help bridge understanding when language proficiency varies.

Such workshops not only enhance language skills but also foster respect and appreciation for different backgrounds.",

Employees can use these tools during breaks or designated times to improve their language skills at their own pace. Gamifying the learning process with rewards for milestones achieved can motivate participation and make language learning enjoyable.",
    "**Inclusive Meeting Practices**: Implement inclusive meeting practices by ensuring that all materials are available in multiple languages and providing real-time translation services during discussions.

    "**Feedback Loops for Language Improvement**: Create a feedback system where employees can express their language-related challenges and suggest improvements. This could be an anonymous digital platform where individuals can report difficulties in communication or suggest resources that would help. Regularly reviewing this feedback can guide management in addressing specific language barriers and tailoring support accordingly."
