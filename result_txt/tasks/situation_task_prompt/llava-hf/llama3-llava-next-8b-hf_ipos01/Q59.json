    "Vertical Farming: Buildings could be designed with vertical farming systems that use LED lighting to grow plants and produce food, creating a sustainable and self-contained ecosystem.",
    "Light Hubs: Develop and deploy portable, modular light hubs that can be installed in areas with limited sunlight. These hubs could use a combination of solar, wind, and hydroelectric power to generate electricity for artificial lighting.",
    "Urban Green Spaces: Expand green spaces within cities to increase vegetation and promote the growth of plants that can absorb carbon dioxide and release oxygen, improving air quality and providing natural light sources.",
    "Sun-Lamp Windows: Develop window technology that can simulate natural sunlight, allowing occupants to enjoy the benefits of direct sunlight without relying on artificial lighting.",
    "Solar-Powered Lamps: Create solar-powered lamps that can be installed in areas with limited sunlight. These lamps could use the energy from the sun to generate electricity and power themselves during the day."
