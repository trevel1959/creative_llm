    "**Augmented Reality (AR) Integration**: Create glasses that incorporate AR technology, allowing users to see digital information overlaid onto their real-world view. This could include navigation directions, notifications from their smartphones, or even real-time translations of foreign languages. The glasses could be equipped with voice recognition and gesture controls for an intuitive user experience.",
    "**Health Monitoring Features**: Design glasses with built-in health monitoring sensors that can track vital signs such as heart rate, blood pressure, and even blood glucose levels. This would allow users to keep tabs on their health throughout the day, and the data could be synced with a smartphone app for comprehensive health management. The glasses could also provide reminders for medication or hydration.",
    "**Personalized Fit Technology**: Introduce glasses with customizable frames that can be adjusted to fit the userâ€™s face perfectly. Using 3D scanning technology, users could create a digital model of their face, and the glasses could be printed or adjusted in real-time for maximum comfort and style. This feature would ensure that the glasses not only look good but also stay in place during various activities.",
    "**Smart Cleaning System**: Implement a self-cleaning mechanism in the lenses that uses ultrasonic waves or a hydrophobic coating to repel dust, fingerprints, and smudges. This would reduce the need for constant cleaning and maintenance, allowing users to keep their glasses clear and pristine with minimal effort. An indicator could notify users when the cleaning system is activated.",
    "**Integrated Audio and Communication**: Develop glasses that come with bone conduction speakers or integrated earbuds, allowing users to listen to music, take phone calls, or receive audio notifications without the need for additional devices. This feature would enable hands-free communication and entertainment, making it ideal for active users who want to stay connected while on the go."
