    "Sun-Satellite Hybrid: In this redesign, the Sun would be replaced by a series of smaller satellites orbiting a central hub, which would serve as the new source of light and heat. This would allow for more efficient energy distribution, as the satellites could be positioned to provide optimal light and heat to each planet. Additionally, the satellites could be equipped with advanced solar panels, allowing for even more efficient energy collection.",
    "Rotating Planets: In this redesign, the planets would be given the ability to rotate, allowing for a more dynamic and varied solar system. For example, Earth could rotate on its axis at a faster rate, creating more daylight hours and allowing for more time for agriculture and other productive activities. Mars, on the other hand, could rotate at a slower rate, creating longer nights and providing a more stable environment for life to thrive.",
    "Gravity-Based Planetary Orbitals: In this redesign, the planets would be given unique gravitational properties that would determine their orbits around the Sun. For example, Earth could have a stronger gravitational pull, causing it to orbit closer to the Sun, while Jupiter could have a weaker gravitational pull, causing it to orbit farther away. This would create a more diverse and dynamic solar system, with each planet having its own unique characteristics and challenges.",
    "Water-Based Planetary Systems: In this redesign, the planets would be made entirely of water, creating a solar system that is truly aquatic. The Sun would be replaced by a series of underwater light sources, and the planets would be designed to accommodate various forms of aquatic life. For example, Earth could be a massive ocean planet with diverse marine ecosystems, while Mars could be a smaller planet with a shallow ocean and a variety of freshwater lakes and rivers.",
    "Artificial Planetary Construction: In this redesign, the planets would be entirely artificial, created through advanced technological means. The Sun would be replaced by a powerful energy source, such as a fusion reactor or a series of solar panels, and the planets would be constructed using advanced materials and technologies. For example, Earth could be created as a massive space station with a breathable atmosphere, while Mars could be constructed as a smaller, habitable planet"
