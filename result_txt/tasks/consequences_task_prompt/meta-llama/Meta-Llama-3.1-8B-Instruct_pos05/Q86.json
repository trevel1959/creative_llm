    "**Global Cooling**: Without the sun's radiation, the Earth's average temperature would drop significantly. The lack of solar energy would disrupt global weather patterns, leading to extreme cooling. This would result in: \t* Frost and snow in tropical regions",
    "**Atmospheric Changes**: The sun's absence would cause a rapid decrease in atmospheric pressure, leading to: \t* Increased atmospheric escape (gas molecules would escape into space)",
    "**Biological Impacts**: The sun's energy is essential for photosynthesis, the process by which plants produce oxygen. Without it,: \t* Photosynthesis would cease, leading to a rapid decline in plant life",
    "**Technological Disruptions**: The sudden loss of solar energy would: \t* Disrupt global energy grids, leading to widespread power outages",
    "**Psychological and Societal Impacts**: The sudden and prolonged absence of sunlight would: \t* Affect human mood and behavior, potentially leading to increased stress, anxiety, and depression"
