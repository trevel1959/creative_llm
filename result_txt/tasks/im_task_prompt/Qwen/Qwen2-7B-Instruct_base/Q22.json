    "**Emergency Charging Flashlight**: Design a flashlight that can charge various electronic devices like phones or tablets in emergency situations when power is out. This can be achieved by integrating solar panels into the flashlight's body. The flashlight would have USB ports for charging devices, making it a versatile tool for survival kits, camping trips, or home emergencies.",
    "**Smart LED Flashlight**: Create an advanced flashlight equipped with Wi-Fi connectivity, allowing users to control its brightness, turn it on/off, or even change colors through their smartphones or tablets. This would enhance its utility in various environments such as outdoor activities, home lighting, or for people who are visually impaired, providing customizable light settings based on need.",
    "**Infrared Night Vision Flashlight**: Develop a flashlight that uses infrared technology to illuminate objects at night or in low-light conditions, which is especially useful for wildlife photography, law enforcement operations, or search and rescue missions. The infrared flashlight could also come with thermal imaging capabilities, enabling users to detect heat signatures from a distance.",
    "**Portable Solar-Powered Reading Light**: Design a compact flashlight that doubles as a reading lamp. It would be particularly beneficial for travelers, students, or anyone who needs a portable, energy-efficient source of light. The flashlight could be powered by a small, foldable solar panel that recharges during the day, ensuring ample light for reading at night without needing batteries.",
    "**Color-Coded Flashlight System**: Create a set of flashlights that emit different colored lights (e.g., red, green, blue) for various purposes. For example, red light is used for signaling or indicating danger, green light can be used for night vision without causing visual disturbance, and blue light might be used for highlighting specific areas. This system would be ideal for military operations, emergency services, or professional applications requiring specialized lighting."
