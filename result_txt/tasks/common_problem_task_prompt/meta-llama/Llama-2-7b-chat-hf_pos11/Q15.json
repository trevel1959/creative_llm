    "Vertical Garden: Create a unique and space-saving garden by utilizing vertical gardening techniques. Build a wall-mounted trellis or a freestanding trellis using bamboo or metal poles. Train climbing plants like beans, peas, or cucumbers to grow up the trellis, maximizing your available space. This method will not only save room in your backyard but also add a visually appealing element to your outdoor space.",
    "Hydroponic Garden: Embrace a modern and sustainable approach to gardening by implementing a hydroponic system. Hydroponics involves growing plants in a nutrient-rich solution rather than soil, which conserves water and reduces the need for land. You can build a DIY hydroponic system using a plastic container, a pump, and a grow medium like rockwool or clay pellets. With this method, you can grow a variety of herbs, leafy greens, and even small fruits like strawberries.",
    "Rainwater Harvesting: Collect and utilize rainwater to irrigate your garden, reducing your reliance on municipal water supplies. Install a rainwater harvesting system that captures and stores rainwater in a large container or tank. Connect the tank to a series of pipes and emitters that distribute the water to your plants. This eco-friendly method will not only save you money on water bills but also help to conserve this precious resource.",
    "Edible Landscaping: Incorporate edible plants into your landscape design to create a functional and visually appealing garden. Plant fruit trees, berry bushes, and herbs around your property, using them as a natural hedge or border. This approach not only provides fresh produce but also adds beauty and diversity to your outdoor space. You can also incorporate edible plants into your flower beds or use them as a groundcover.",
    "Geodesic Dome Greenhouse: Build a geodesic dome greenhouse to create a warm and inviting space for growing plants year-round. The dome shape provides maximum interior space with minimal materials, making it an energy-efficient and sustainable option.
