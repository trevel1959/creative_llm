    "The inhabitants of this world are friendly creatures made of soft serve and cotton candy, who welcome Timmy with open arms. They invite him to join them in their daily activities, such as building snowmen out of scoops of vanilla and chocolate ice cream, and playing tag with flying saucers of strawberry ice cream.",
