    "**Eco-Friendly Tree House**: Design a tree house that is completely eco-friendly. Use sustainable materials like bamboo or reclaimed wood, solar panels for electricity, and rainwater harvesting systems for water supply. Incorporate natural ventilation to reduce the need for air conditioning, and plant native species around the structure to enhance biodiversity.",
    "**Tree House with a Secret Passageway**: Create a unique experience by incorporating a secret passageway into the design of your tree house. This could be a hidden door or tunnel leading to a surprise location within the tree or even a small garden area. The secret entrance can be disguised as part of the tree itself, making it both thrilling and magical.",
    "**Themed Tree Houses**: Build tree houses with different themes based on various cultures, fairy tales, or historical periods. For example, create a medieval castle-themed tree house complete with turrets and drawbridges, or a Japanese-style tea house with tatami mats and a minimalist design. This not only adds character to the tree house but also provides an educational and immersive experience.",
    "**Interactive Tree House with Technology**: Integrate technology into your tree house design to create an interactive and educational space. Include features like augmented reality games, smart lighting that changes colors or brightness based on time of day, and sensors that track environmental conditions such as temperature and humidity. This could also include a small library or a telescope for stargazing.",
    "**Tree House with a Rooftop Garden**: Extend the concept of vertical gardening by adding a rooftop garden to the tree house. Utilize hydroponics or vertical planters to grow a variety of plants, fruits, and vegetables. This not only enhances the aesthetic appeal of the tree house but also offers a practical application of sustainable living practices, teaching the importance of self-sufficiency and urban agriculture."
