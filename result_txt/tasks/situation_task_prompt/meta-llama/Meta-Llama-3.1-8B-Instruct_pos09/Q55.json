    "**News Apps and Websites**: With the rise of smartphones and internet connectivity, I would rely on news apps and websites to stay updated on current events. Many reputable news sources have mobile apps and websites that provide timely and in-depth coverage of news from around the world. I would download and use apps like BBC News, CNN, Al Jazeera, and The New York Times to get the latest news and analysis.",
    "**Podcasts**: I would subscribe to popular news podcasts like The Daily from The New York Times, NPR's Up First, and Pod Save America to stay informed about current events. These podcasts offer in-depth analysis and discussion on various news topics, often with expert guests and perspectives.",
    "**Social Media and Online Communities**: I would join online communities and follow news-oriented social media accounts to stay up-to-date on news and discussions. Platforms like Twitter, Reddit, and Facebook Groups would provide a space to engage with others who share similar interests and stay informed about current events.",
    "**Rumors and Word of Mouth**: In the absence of televisions, I would rely on rumors and word of mouth to get news about major events. I would ask friends, family, and colleagues about what's happening and share my own information to help spread the news.",
    "**Old-School Methods: Print Newspapers and Radio**: I would visit local newsstands or subscribe to print newspapers like The New York Times, The Wall Street Journal, or The Guardian to get in-depth coverage of news. I would also tune into local radio stations or listen to news programs on the radio to stay informed about current events. These traditional methods would provide a more in-depth and nuanced understanding of news, without the distractions of modern media. [/INST] "
