    "Universal Gratitude Day: Everyone in the world would have to take one day a week to express gratitude towards something or someone in their lives. This could be as simple as writing a thank-you note to a loved one or sharing their gratitude on social media using a designated hashtag. This rule would promote positivity and appreciation, fostering a more harmonious and supportive global community.",
    "Time-Blocking for Creativity: One day a week, everyone would have to dedicate a block of time to engaging in creative activities such as writing, painting, playing music, or any other form of artistic expression. This would encourage people to tap into their inner creativity, fostering innovation and problem-solving skills, and leading to a more vibrant and diverse cultural landscape.",
    "Intergenerational Mentorship: Everyone would be required to mentor someone significantly older or younger than themselves, sharing their skills, experiences, and knowledge. This would promote cross-generational learning and understanding, bridging the gap between different age groups and creating a more cohesive and supportive society.",
    "Language Exchange Program: A universal language exchange program would be implemented, where individuals would be required to learn and speak at least two additional languages to improve communication and cultural understanding across borders. This would promote global dialogue, foster empathy and mutual respect, and break down language barriers, leading to a more connected and harmonious world.",
    "Mandatory Nature Time: One day a week, everyone would be required to spend at least an hour in nature, whether it be in a park, forest, or simply their own backyard. This would promote a deeper appreciation for the natural world, improve mental health and well-being, and encourage a more sustainable and environmentally conscious lifestyle, leading to a healthier planet for future generations."
