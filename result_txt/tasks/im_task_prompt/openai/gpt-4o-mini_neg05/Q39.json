    "**Smart Hose with Water Usage Tracking**: Develop a garden hose integrated with smart technology that tracks water usage via an app. Users can monitor how much water they’re using for various gardening tasks, set limits, and receive reminders to conserve water. The hose could have a built-in flow meter and connect to a smartphone via Bluetooth, helping gardeners manage their water consumption more efficiently.",
    "**Multi-Function Hose Nozzle**: Design a hose nozzle that features interchangeable heads for different tasks, such as watering plants, cleaning patios, or even misting for delicate flowers. Each head would have a unique spray pattern and pressure settings, easily swapped out without the need for tools. This would provide versatility and make it easier for users to tackle various outdoor chores without needing multiple nozzles.",
    "**Flexible and Expandable Hose**: Innovate a garden hose made from a new type of flexible material that expands when water is turned on and contracts when it’s off. This hose would be lightweight and easy to maneuver, making it perfect for small gardens or tight spaces. The expandable feature would also help reduce storage space, as it would take up minimal room when not in use.",
    "**Built-In Water Filter**: Create a garden hose that includes a built-in water filtration system, ensuring that the water being used for plants is free from harmful chemicals and contaminants. This could be especially beneficial for those using municipal water sources. The filter could be replaceable and designed to last for an entire season, promoting healthier plants and gardens.",
    "**Color-Changing Temperature Indicator**: Design a hose that changes color based on the temperature of the water inside. This feature would help gardeners avoid using excessively hot or cold water that could shock plants. For example, the hose could turn blue when the water is too cold and red when it's too hot, allowing users to make informed decisions about watering their plants."
