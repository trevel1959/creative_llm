    "Solar-Powered Vehicles: One creative solution to power vehicles if all the world's oil disappeared is to convert vehicles to run on solar energy. This could be achieved by installing solar panels on the vehicle's body or integrating solar cells into the vehicle's design. The solar panels would absorb sunlight and convert it into electricity, which would power the vehicle's electric motor. This would provide a clean, renewable, and sustainable source of energy for transportation.",
    "Hydrogen Fuel Cells: Another option to power vehicles without oil is to use hydrogen fuel cells. Hydrogen fuel cells convert hydrogen into electricity, which can then be used to power electric motors. The only byproduct of this process is water vapor and heat, making it a clean and environmentally friendly source of energy. Additionally, hydrogen can be produced from renewable energy sources like solar or wind power, further reducing its carbon footprint.",
    "Advanced Battery Technologies: To power vehicles without oil, advanced battery technologies could be developed to store electricity generated from renewable energy sources like wind or solar power. For example, lithium-ion batteries could be improved upon to increase their energy density and lifespan, allowing for longer driving ranges and reduced charging times. Other advanced battery technologies like supercapacitors or solid-state batteries could also be explored.",
    "Electricity-Generating Roadways: A futuristic solution to power vehicles without oil is to install electricity-generating roadways. These roadways could be covered with special solar panels or piezoelectric materials that generate electricity as vehicles drive over them. The electricity could then be transmitted wirelessly to the vehicles, powering their electric motors without the need for traditional fuel sources. This would provide a clean, sustainable, and virtually unlimited source of energy for transportation.",
    "Bio-Fuel Cells: Another creative solution to power vehicles without oil is to use bio-fuel cells that convert organic matter into energy. For example, algae could be grown in large quantities and converted into bio-diesel or bio-gas, which could be used to power vehicles. This would provide a renewable and sustainable source of energy that reduces the dependence on fossil fuels and lowers carbon emissions."
