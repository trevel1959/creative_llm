    "Infinite Energy: To eliminate the need for sleep and energy consumption, I would design the human body to harness clean, renewable energy sources. This could involve integrating solar panels, wind turbines, or other eco-friendly energy systems into the body's structure, allowing for continuous energy production without the need for food or sleep.",
    "Infinite Longevity: To extend human lifespan indefinitely, I would focus on the development of advanced regenerative systems that repair and replace damaged tissues and organs. This could include the creation of synthetic replacement parts, stem cell therapies, and advanced gene-editing technologies that allow for the repair and maintenance of the body's cells and systems.",
    "Superhuman Strength and Endurance: Another key change would be to enhance the human body's strength and endurance. This could be achieved through the development of new muscle fibers, bone structures, and connective tissues that provide increased strength and durability. Additionally, advancements in exoskeleton technology could be incorporated to provide external support and augmentation for the body's natural abilities.",
    "Infinite Knowledge and Intelligence: To grant humans infinite knowledge and intelligence, I would design the body to integrate advanced neural interfaces that connect directly to the brain. This could involve the development of non-invasive brain-computer interfaces that allow for the seamless transfer of information and the ability to process information at lightning-fast speeds.",
    "Superhuman Senses: In order to enhance human sensory capabilities, I would develop advanced sensory systems that provide heightened perception and awareness. This could involve the creation of new sensory organs, such as infrared or ultraviolet vision, as well as the integration of advanced technologies like augmented reality and virtual reality to provide immersive sensory experiences."
