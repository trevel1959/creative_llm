    "In a quaint village, a lonely child named Mia built a snowman on Christmas Eve. She adorned him with a scarf and a hat, whispering her wishes for friendship. As the clock struck midnight, a shimmering light enveloped the snowman, and he blinked awake. \"Thank you for bringing me to life!\" he exclaimed, his voice warm like cocoa. Together, they danced under the moonlight, sharing secrets and laughter. But as dawn approached, the snowman felt himself melting. \"I must go,\" he said, tears of snow glistening in his eyes. Mia hugged him tight, promising to remember their magical night forever.",
