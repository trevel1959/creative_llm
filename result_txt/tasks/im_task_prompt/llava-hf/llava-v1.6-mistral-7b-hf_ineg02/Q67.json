    "**Color Palette Integration**: Design the paintbrush with a built-in color palette that can be easily accessed and adjusted. This would allow artists to switch between colors quickly and without needing to leave their workspace, improving their workflow.",
    "**Adjustable Bristles**: Incorporate a mechanism that allows the bristles to be adjusted for different types of paint and strokes. This would enable artists to have a single brush that can adapt to various painting techniques.",
    "**Digital Interface**: Equip the paintbrush with a digital interface that can be controlled via a smartphone or tablet. This would allow artists to customize their brushes, access tutorials, and even connect with other artists for collaborative projects.",
    "**Ergonomic Design**: Create a paintbrush with an ergonomic design that reduces strain on the artist's hand and wrist. This could include a comfortable grip, weight distribution, and pressure-sensitive bristles that adjust to the artist's touch.",
    "**Self-Cleaning Feature**: Integrate a self-cleaning mechanism into the paintbrush that can remove paint residue without the need for water or solvents. This would save time and reduce the mess associated with painting."
