    "Create a modified bicycle with a powerful motorized rear wheel, enabling you to pedal backward and trigger the motor to propel you in the opposite direction. The bicycle would have a switch installed that changes the direction of the motor when you flip the switch while pedaling.",
    "Develop a self-driving vehicle, like a car or a jetpack, that can detect the movement and intent of pedestrians. It would be equipped with sensors that recognize your movements and adjust the vehicle's course or speed accordingly, allowing you to move backward with ease.",
    "Create an intelligent prosthetic leg or a set of legs that incorporate a powerful motor and sensors capable of detecting the wearer's movements. The prosthetic legs would activate in response to signals from the nervous system or sensors on the body, enabling the wearer to move backward when they lean forward.",
    "Invent a set of specialized rollerblades or skates with integrated motors that can detect movements and reverse their direction upon sensing a shift in weight forward. The user would be able to balance themselves by adjusting their weight distribution and move backward using the rollerblades or skates.",
    "Develop an exoskeleton with a mechanical arm that can be operated by the user's arm movements or via a controller. The mechanical arm would have a motor that could detect movement to replicate the user's backward motion, potentially lifting them off the ground and providing them with the means to move in the opposite direction."
