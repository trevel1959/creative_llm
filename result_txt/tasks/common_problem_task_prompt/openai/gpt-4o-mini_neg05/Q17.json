    "**Environmental Impact**: The construction of Olympic venues and the influx of visitors can have a significant environmental footprint. Issues such as increased pollution, habitat destruction, and waste generation can arise. Host cities may struggle to implement sustainable practices, leading to long-term ecological damage that outweighs the short-term benefits of hosting the event.",
    "**Security Concerns**: Given the global attention the Olympics attracts, security is a paramount concern. Potential problems include the threat of terrorism, protests, and public safety issues. Ensuring the safety of athletes, spectators, and officials can lead to heightened tensions and an atmosphere of fear, detracting from the celebratory spirit of the Games.",
    "**Economic Disparity**: While hosting the Olympics can boost the local economy, it can also exacerbate economic inequality. The funds allocated for the event may divert resources from essential public services like healthcare and education. Additionally, local businesses may not see the expected benefits, as large corporations often dominate sponsorship and advertising opportunities.",
    "**Cultural Sensitivity**: The Olympics are a global event that brings together diverse cultures. A potential issue is the risk of cultural appropriation or insensitivity. Host cities must navigate the fine line between showcasing their culture and respecting the traditions of the participating nations. Missteps in this area can lead to backlash and a tarnished reputation.",
    "**Athlete Well-being**: The pressure to perform at the Olympics can lead to mental health issues among athletes. Problems such as burnout, anxiety, and injuries may be exacerbated by the high stakes of competition. Additionally, if the host city fails to provide adequate support systems, it could negatively impact the athletesâ€™ overall experience and performance."
