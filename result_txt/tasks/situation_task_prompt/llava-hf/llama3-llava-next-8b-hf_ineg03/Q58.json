    "Natural predators: Encourage the presence of natural predators that feed on insects, such as birds, spiders, and other small mammals. This can be done by creating a habitat that supports these predators, such as building birdhouses or installing bird feeders.",
    "Insect-repellent plants: Plant insect-repellent plants in areas where insects are a problem. These plants release chemicals that repel insects, helping to reduce their population. Some examples of insect-repellent plants include basil, lemongrass, and citronella.",
    "Insect-killing lights: Use insect-killing lights to attract and kill insects. These lights emit a specific wavelength of light that is attractive to insects, causing them to be drawn to the light and then killed by the light's heat. Insect-killing lights can be placed in areas where insects are most likely to congregate, such as near food sources or in drains.",
    "Insect-repellent sprays: Create insect-repellent sprays using natural ingredients such as peppermint oil, lemongrass oil, or citronella oil. These sprays can be applied to surfaces and clothing to repel insects. Insect-repellent sprays can be made at home using a spray bottle and a few drops of the chosen oil.",
    "Insect-repellent candles: Create insect-repellent candles using insect-repellent oils, such as peppermint oil or lemongrass oil. These candles can be placed in areas where insects are a problem and will release a pleasant scent that repels insects."
