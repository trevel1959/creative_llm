    "Can/cannot play 3 musical instruments",
    "I’ve lost count on how many times I’ve said to myself, why can’t people just stop their bickering and have a bloody good laugh for once?",
    "I love making people smile, I love hearing other people’s jokes, I adore meeting new people;",
    "And although I do not forget that, it doesn’t really matter anymore; It doesn’t make no odd difference how many years has passed since I was a little girl; and if the bird who forged a flying path has forgotten even one stroke, I don’t mind about it either in this world. For instance, after I lost my mom, who also was our family’s sole provider, my dad was only able to leave me my dad; However, the thoughtful little bird still managed to slip his beautiful nest which looked like a little nest into my pocket, telling me my dear daddy had left that home for some reasons I don’t yet understand. Then I ran so hard out of our door into freedom to spread both my love to the whole wide world from my parents to my children ( I have one daughter. ) but also in a new hope of my dream like the fairytale, a dream is that I could be a great comedian like my mother.",
    "I believe she is not lying on her daddy’s side, in their eternity. She’s just away in our country now working on the playhouse where most famous actors starred and made millions to become what you see from the bird’s eye point of view; and if you see from our eyes: one eye as a big cat and the other one is just another single ordinary man, she’ll become the first man in this world who flew in heaven and who could really walk the earth as a man on her daddy’s shoulder, to reach a greater destiny."
