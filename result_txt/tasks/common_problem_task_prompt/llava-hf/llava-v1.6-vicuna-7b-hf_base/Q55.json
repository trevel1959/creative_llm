    "Balancing conservation and recreation: The park will need to strike a balance between conserving the natural environment and providing recreational opportunities for visitors. If the park is too restrictive, it may fail to attract visitors, while if it is too permissive, it may fail to protect the environment effectively.",
    "Encroachment by human activity: As the park is being established, there may be ongoing human activity in the area that could threaten the park's integrity. For example, illegal logging, poaching, or infrastructure development could all pose a threat to the park's ability to protect the natural environment.",
    "Invasive species: Invasive species can be a significant threat to the ecosystems within the park. These species can outcompete and displace native species, leading to a decline in biodiversity.",
    "Weather and natural disasters: Natural disasters, such as floods or storms, can cause significant damage to the park's infrastructure and the natural environment. These events can also displace or kill wildlife, further threatening the park's ability to protect the environment.",
    "Limited public awareness and support: To be successful, the park will need the support and engagement of the local community. If the public is not aware of the park's goals and the need for conservation, it may be difficult to secure the necessary resources and support to protect the natural environment effectively."
