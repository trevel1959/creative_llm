    "Lily had always been enchanted by rainbows, but one day, after a storm, she decided to chase one. She followed its vibrant arc through fields and forests until she reached a glimmering clearing. There, at the end of the rainbow, stood a shimmering pot, not filled with gold, but with colorful, swirling mist. As she approached, the mist transformed into memories of joy and laughter from her past. Realizing the true treasure was the happiness she had experienced, Lily smiled, knowing that the magic of the rainbow was not in riches, but in the moments that filled her heart with light.",
