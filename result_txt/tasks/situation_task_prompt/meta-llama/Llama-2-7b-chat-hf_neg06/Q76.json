    "Carrier Pigeons: In the event of a global phone outage, a novel approach to long-distance communication could be to utilize carrier pigeons. These birds have been used for centuries to transmit messages over long distances, and with some training, they could be used again. Each pigeon could be trained to carry a small message attached to its leg, and they could be released at designated locations to deliver the messages. This method would be slow but reliable, and could be especially useful in remote areas where other forms of communication are unavailable.",
    "Homing Pigeons: Similar to carrier pigeons, homing pigeons could also be used to transmit messages over long distances. These pigeons are trained to find their way back to their home location, and they could be used to carry messages between different locations. By releasing the pigeons at designated locations, messages could be delivered to their intended recipients. This method would be slower than modern communication methods, but it would be a reliable and low-tech solution in the event of a global phone outage.",
    "Optical Messages: Another creative solution to long-distance communication in the event of a phone outage could be to use optical messages. This could involve using mirrors or other reflective surfaces to reflect light signals between locations. For example, a message could be written on a piece of paper and placed in a mirror, and then the mirror could be directed towards a receiving location where the message could be read. This method would be slow and unreliable, but it could be used in areas where other forms of communication are unavailable.",
    "Drone-based Communication: Drones could be used to transmit messages over long distances in the event of a global phone outage. These drones could be equipped with small cameras or other communication devices that could be used to transmit messages between locations. By using drones to transmit messages, information could be delivered quickly and efficiently, even in areas where other forms of communication are unavailable. This method would be more reliable and faster than other low-tech solutions, but it would still be slower than modern communication methods.",
    "Smoke Signals: In the event of a global phone outage, smoke signals could be used to transmit messages over long distances. This method would involve creating smoke signals using fires or other smoke-producing devices, and then directing the"
