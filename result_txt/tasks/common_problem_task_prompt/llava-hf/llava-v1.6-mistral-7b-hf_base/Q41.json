    "Life Support Systems: Another challenge is providing a life support system that can sustain human life in the harsh environment of space. This includes providing air, water, and temperature regulation. One solution could be to use a combination of advanced life support systems and recycling technologies to conserve resources and minimize waste.",
    "Communication: Communication is critical for any space mission. One potential problem is the time it takes for signals to travel between Earth and the spaceship. One solution could be to use advanced communication technologies that can reduce the time it takes for signals to travel and improve the reliability of communication.",
    "Energy: Powering a spaceship is another challenge. One solution could be to use a combination of solar panels and nuclear reactors to generate power. Solar panels can be used to harness the energy of the sun, while nuclear reactors can provide a reliable source of power for longer missions.",
    "Environmental Impact: The launch of a spaceship can have a significant environmental impact. One solution could be to use sustainable materials and technologies to reduce the impact of the launch on the environment. This could include using reusable rockets and minimizing the use of harmful chemicals.",
    "Mental Health: Prolonged space travel can have a significant impact on the mental health of astronauts. One solution could be to incorporate advanced mental health technologies and support systems to help astronauts cope with the challenges of space travel."
