    "Physical mail: In an era without phones, people would return to old-fashioned forms of communication. Physical mail might become more prevalent, as people write letters and send them through the post office. While it's slow, it's still a reliable method of communication that would allow people to stay connected over long distances.",
    "Video conferencing through laptops: Another option for communication would be to use laptops and video conferencing software. Video calls would still be a feasible way to communicate with others, albeit slower than phone calls.",
    "Morse code: In a truly desperate situation, people could return to using Morse code to send messages over long distances. Morse code has been around for over a century and is a simple, effective way to communicate without using a phone. Using modern technology, electronic devices that can translate text into Morse code and vice versa are available, making it an accessible option.",
    "Visual communication: People could rely on visual communication through art, photography, or other forms of visual media to convey messages and stay connected. While it may not be as immediate or personal as a phone call, it can be a powerful way to share experiences, emotions, and ideas.",
    "Signal flags: Taking inspiration from historical methods of long-distance communication, signal flags could be employed to send messages over distances. Each flag would represent a letter or a pre-arranged symbol, allowing people to send messages through a series of flag signals. This method would be slow and labor-intensive but would still be effective for short distances."
