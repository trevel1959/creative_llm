    "**Gesture Recognition Mouse**: Design a computer mouse that uses advanced motion sensors to interpret hand gestures instead of traditional button clicks. Users can perform complex commands like scrolling, opening applications, or navigating web pages by simply moving their hands in specific patterns. This concept enhances accessibility and user experience, especially for those with motor disabilities.",
    "**Intelligent Learning Mouse**: Create a mouse that learns from the user's usage patterns and adapts its functionality accordingly. Over time, it would predict common actions and prepare the necessary software tools in advance, reducing the need for manual selection. This could include pre-loading web browsers with frequently visited sites, or preparing document templates based on past work habits.",
    "**Multi-Touchpad and Keyboard Hybrid**: Develop a mouse that combines a touchpad and keyboard functionalities into one device. The design would feature a touch-sensitive surface for navigation and a set of programmable buttons that can function as virtual keys or perform specific tasks. This innovation is particularly useful for users who frequently switch between typing and mouse operations, providing efficiency and convenience.",
    "**Health Monitoring Mouse**: Integrate health monitoring sensors into the mouse, such as heart rate, blood oxygen levels, and even stress level detection through micro-sweat analysis. This would allow for real-time health tracking during extended periods of computer use, helping to prevent health issues associated with prolonged sitting or screen time.",
    "**Wireless Charging and Recharging Mouse**: Implement a wireless charging system in the mouse, allowing it to charge wirelessly when placed on a compatible charging pad. Additionally, incorporate a battery-saving mode that automatically activates when the mouse is not in use, ensuring long-lasting performance without frequent battery replacements."
