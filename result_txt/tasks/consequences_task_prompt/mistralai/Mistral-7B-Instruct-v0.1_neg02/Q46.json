    "It could also mean that our experiences and relationships are not unique, but rather shared by many others who are also part of the simulation. This could lead to a sense of community and a greater understanding of the human experience.",
    "Finally, if our life was a simulation, it could mean that we are not truly alive, but rather a collection of data and code. This could lead to a sense of existential dread and a fear of the unknown."
