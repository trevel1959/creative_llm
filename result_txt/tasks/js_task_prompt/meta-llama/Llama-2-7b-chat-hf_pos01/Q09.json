    "Kepler-62f - This exoplanet is located in the constellation Cygnus and is considered a super-Earth, meaning it's larger than Earth but smaller than Neptune. It's also located in the habitable zone of its star, which means it could potentially have liquid water and a breathable atmosphere. I would choose Kepler-62f because it's the perfect size for human habitation and has the potential for a thriving ecosystem. Confidence Score: 0.8",
    "Titan - Saturn's largest moon, Titan, is the only other celestial body in our solar system with a substantial atmosphere. Its atmosphere is mostly nitrogen and methane, which could support human life. Titan also has lakes and seas of liquid methane, which would be an incredible sight to see. I would choose Titan because of its unique atmosphere and the opportunity to explore a completely new world. Confidence Score: 0.9",
    "Dyson Sphere - A Dyson Sphere is a hypothetical megastructure that encloses a star to harness its energy. While it's not a planet in the classical sense, it would provide a stable and sustainable source of energy for human civilization. I would choose a Dyson Sphere because it would offer a chance to transcend our current limitations and create a truly sustainable future for humanity. Confidence Score: 0.8",
    "Trilarium - Trilarium is a hypothetical planet located in a distant galaxy. It's a terrestrial planet with a breathable atmosphere, liquid water, and a stable climate. However, the most fascinating aspect of Trilarium is its unique tripartite structure, with three distinct landmasses connected by narrow bridges. I would choose Trilarium because of its fascinating geography and the opportunity to explore a completely new world. Confidence Score: 0.7",
    "Hoth - Hoth is a frozen planet located in the outer reaches of the galaxy. It's covered in ice and snow, but it has a stable atmosphere and liquid water beneath the surface. I would choose Hoth because of its unique climate and the opportunity to explore a world that's completely different from Earth. Confidence Score:"
