    "Floating Gardens: The city could be designed with floating gardens that double as parks and recreational spaces. These gardens could be made up of a variety of plants, including flowers, trees, and herbs, and could be irrigated using a system of canals and waterways. The gardens could also be used for farming, providing a sustainable source of food for the city's inhabitants.",
    "Skywalkers: The city could be equipped with a network of sky bridges and walkways that connect the different districts and neighborhoods. These sky walkers could be lined with shops, restaurants, and entertainment venues, providing a unique and exciting way for citizens to move around the city.",
    "Cloud Harvesting: The city could be designed with a system of cloud harvesting towers that collect and store rainwater and other atmospheric moisture. This water could then be used for drinking, irrigation, and other purposes, making the city more self-sufficient and reducing its reliance on external water sources.",
    "Airships: The city could be equipped with a fleet of airships that serve as transportation and delivery vessels. These airships could be powered by wind, solar, or other renewable energy sources, making them a sustainable and environmentally friendly mode of transportation.",
    "Solar Sails: The city could be designed with a system of solar sails that harness the power of the sun to generate electricity and provide energy for the city's infrastructure. These solar sails could be made up of lightweight, reflective materials that are angled to maximize exposure to the sun's rays, making them a highly efficient and sustainable source of energy."
