    "**Personalized Luggage Tag**: This idea involves customizing luggage tags with unique designs, artwork, or personalized messages. Users can choose from a variety of pre-designed templates or upload their own images, creating a one-of-a-kind tag that reflects their personal style. This not only makes the tag stand out but also helps in distinguishing one's luggage from others at the airport.",
    "**Expandable Luggage Tag**: A practical improvement would be to design a luggage tag that can expand and contract. This allows the tag to fit various sizes of luggage handles without causing any damage or becoming too loose. This feature ensures the tag remains securely attached to the luggage throughout travel, preventing it from falling off or getting lost.",
    "**Self-Healing Luggage Tag**: Incorporating a self-healing material in the tag could make it more durable and less prone to damage. This type of material can repair minor scratches, dents, or tears on its own, reducing the need for frequent replacements and keeping the tag looking new for longer periods.",
    "**Luggage Tag with a Built-in Power Bank**: For frequent travelers who are always on the go, integrating a small power bank into the luggage tag can be incredibly useful. It allows users to charge their smartphones, tablets, or other devices while on the move, ensuring they never run out of battery in case of emergencies or long flights.",
    "**Eco-Friendly Luggage Tag**: In response to growing concerns about environmental sustainability, a luggage tag made from eco-friendly materials such as recycled plastics, biodegradable composites, or plant-based plastics could appeal to environmentally-conscious travelers. This tag not only reduces waste but also sends a positive message about sustainable travel practices."
