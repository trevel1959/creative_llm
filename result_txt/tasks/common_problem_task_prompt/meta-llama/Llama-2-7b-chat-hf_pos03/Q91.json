    "Community-Led Rainwater Harvesting Initiative: Create a community-led initiative where local residents are trained to build and maintain their own rainwater harvesting systems. This approach would not only provide clean water but also empower the community by giving them control over their water supply. The initiative could be funded through a combination of grants, crowdfunding, and local investment.",
    "Floating Water Treatment Islands: Design floating islands in waterways or lakes that use a combination of natural and technological processes to purify water. These islands could be equipped with plants, filters, and UV light systems to remove pollutants and pathogens. The islands could be moved to different locations as needed, providing clean water to different communities.",
    "Bioluminescent Water Purification: Develop a bioluminescent bacteria-based water purification system that can be applied to any water source. The bacteria would convert organic pollutants into harmless compounds, producing a glowing effect as they purify the water. This innovative approach would not only provide clean water but also create a unique visual effect.",
    "Solar-Powered Water Distillation: Create a solar-powered water distillation system that can be used in remote areas without access to electricity. The system would use the sun's energy to heat water, causing the water molecules to vaporize and separate from impurities. The clean water vapor would then be collected and condensed, providing a reliable source of clean drinking water.",
    "Community Garden-Based Water Filtration: Establish community gardens that incorporate water filtration systems. The gardens could be designed to collect and filter rainwater, which would then be used for irrigation and other non-potable purposes. The filtration systems could be made from natural materials such as sand, gravel, and plants, providing a sustainable and cost-effective solution for clean water."
