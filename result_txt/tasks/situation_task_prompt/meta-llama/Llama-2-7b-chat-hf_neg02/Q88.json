    "Airships: One creative solution to travel if all roads become impassable is to use airships. Airships are a type of hybrid aircraft that use a combination of aerodynamics and lighter-than-air gases to float in the air. They could be powered by electric motors or even solar panels, making them a sustainable and eco-friendly option for long-distance travel. With airships, people could travel over long distances without worrying about road closures or obstacles, and they could even be used for cargo transportation.",
    "Maglev Trains: Another creative solution to travel if all roads become impassable is to use maglev trains. Maglev trains use magnetic levitation technology to float above the tracks, eliminating the need for wheels and reducing friction. This means that maglev trains could travel at much higher speeds than traditional trains, making them a faster and more efficient option for long-distance travel. Additionally, maglev trains could be powered by electricity or even nuclear reactors, making them a sustainable and reliable option for travel.",
    "Hoverbikes: For shorter distances, hoverbikes could be a creative solution to travel if all roads become impassable. Hoverbikes are essentially motorcycles that use fans or rotors to generate lift, allowing them to hover above the ground. This means that hoverbikes could travel over obstacles like roads and rivers, making them a versatile and convenient option for short-distance travel. Hoverbikes could also be powered by electricity or even solar panels, making them a sustainable and eco-friendly option.",
    "Submersibles: For longer distances, submersibles could be a creative solution to travel if all roads become impassable. Submersibles are essentially underwater vehicles that use ballast tanks to descend and ascend in the water. They could be powered by electric motors or even nuclear reactors, making them a sustainable and reliable option for long-distance travel. With submersibles, people could travel underwater without worrying about road closures or obstacles, and they could even be used for cargo transportation.",
    "Spacecraft: For the most ambitious solution to travel if all roads become impassable, one could consider using spacecraft. Spacecraft could be used to travel"
