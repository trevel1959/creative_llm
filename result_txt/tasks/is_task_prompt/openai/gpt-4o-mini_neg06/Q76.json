    "Once in a quaint village, there lived a parrot named Pico who had a peculiar problem: he couldn’t repeat anything. Unlike his feathered friends, who mimicked the villagers’ laughter and chatter, Pico remained silent, observing the world with bright, curious eyes. ",
    "One day, a storm threatened the village, and panic ensued. Villagers ran, but Pico stayed, sensing something was wrong. Instead of mimicking their words, he squawked loudly, flapping his wings to guide them to safety. The villagers, recognizing his unique call, followed him to shelter. From that day on, they cherished Pico not for his mimicry, but for his bravery and wisdom.",
