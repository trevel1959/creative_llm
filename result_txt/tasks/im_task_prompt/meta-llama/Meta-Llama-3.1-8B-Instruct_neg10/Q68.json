    "**Calculator Stand with a Twist**: Create a calculator stand that not only provides a comfortable viewing angle but also doubles as a miniature desk organizer. The stand would have multiple tiers, each with a small compartment to store pens, pencils, or business cards. The stand would be made of a sturdy material, such as metal or high-quality plastic, and have a sleek, modern design.",
    "**Calculator with a Built-in Scanner**: Develop a calculator that has a built-in scanner, allowing users to quickly scan documents, receipts, or QR codes. The scanner would be a high-resolution camera that can capture images and store them in the calculator's memory or send them directly to a connected device via Bluetooth or Wi-Fi.",
    "**Calculator with a Built-in Microphone**: Design a calculator that has a built-in microphone, allowing users to dictate mathematical equations or notes. The microphone would be powered by a rechargeable battery and have noise-cancellation technology to ensure clear audio. The calculator would also have a voice assistant integration, allowing users to ask questions or perform calculations using voice commands.",
    "**Calculator with a Built-in Level**: Create a calculator that has a built-in level, allowing users to ensure that their measurements are accurate. The level would be a high-precision sensor that detects even the slightest deviations in levelness. The calculator would also have a built-in spirit level, allowing users to take precise measurements.",
    "**Calculator with a Built-in Projector**: Develop a calculator that has a built-in projector, allowing users to project mathematical equations or graphs onto a surface. The projector would be a high-resolution display that can project images in a variety of sizes and resolutions. The calculator would also have a built-in laser pointer, allowing users to highlight specific areas of the projected image."
