    "**Smart Window Air Conditioner with Built-in Solar Panel**: Design an air conditioner that can be mounted on a window, but also has a built-in solar panel that generates electricity to power the AC. This would allow users to save money on their electricity bills and reduce their carbon footprint. The solar panel could be integrated into the AC's frame, making it a sleek and modern addition to any room.",
    "**Portable Air Conditioner with a Built-in Humidistat and Dehumidifier**: Create a portable air conditioner that not only cools the air but also monitors and controls humidity levels. This would be especially useful for people who live in humid climates or have allergies. The humidistat would detect the humidity levels in the room and automatically switch between cooling and dehumidifying modes to maintain a comfortable humidity level.",
    "**Air Conditioner with a Built-in Air Purifier and Ionizer**: Design an air conditioner that not only cools the air but also cleans and purifies it. This would be especially useful for people who suffer from allergies or respiratory issues. The air purifier would remove pollutants and allergens from the air, while the ionizer would release negative ions to neutralize airborne pathogens.",
    "**Smart Air Conditioner with Voice Control and Energy Monitoring**: Create an air conditioner that can be controlled using voice commands, such as \"Turn on the AC\" or \"Adjust the temperature to 72 degrees.\" The AC would also come with an energy monitoring system that tracks energy usage and provides users with tips on how to reduce their energy consumption.",
    "**Air Conditioner with a Built-in Air Quality Sensor and Automated Ventilation**: Design an air conditioner that comes with a built-in air quality sensor that detects pollutants and allergens in the air. If the sensor detects poor air quality, the AC would automatically switch to ventilation mode, bringing in fresh air from outside to improve indoor air quality. This would be especially useful for people who live in urban areas with poor air quality. "
