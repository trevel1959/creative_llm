The helmet can also have a built-in camera that captures footage of your ride, allowing you to share your adventures on social media.",
    "Bicycle-Powered Generator: Develop a generator that uses the kinetic energy generated by pedaling a bicycle to charge electronic devices such as smartphones, tablets, and laptops. This would be especially useful for people who enjoy outdoor activities and need a reliable source of power on the go.",
    "Foldable Bicycle: Create a bicycle that can be easily folded and stored in a compact space, making it ideal for city dwellers who have limited storage space. The bike can be folded into a compact shape and stored in a closet or under a bed, allowing for easy transportation and storage.",
    "Bicycle-Based Food Delivery System: Develop a system where bicycles are used to deliver food and other essentials to people in need. The bicycles can be equipped with specialized containers and coolers to keep food fresh during transportation, and the system can be used to deliver food to people in remote areas where access to transportation is limited.",
    "Bicycle-Powered Water Purification System: Create a bicycle-powered water purification system that can be used to provide clean drinking water in areas where access to clean water is limited. The system can use the kinetic energy generated by pedaling a bicycle to power a filtration system that removes impurities from water, making it safe to drink. This would be especially useful in developing countries where access to clean water is limited."
