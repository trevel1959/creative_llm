    "Elevator Hacking: One creative solution would be to hack into the elevator system and manually control the movement of the elevators. This would require some technical expertise and knowledge of the building's elevator control systems. By manipulating the elevator's movements, you could potentially reach the top of the skyscraper. However, this approach is illegal and could result in serious consequences.",
    "Rope and P pulley System: Another idea would be to create a pulley system using ropes and pulleys to lift people up the skyscraper. This would require a large number of ropes and pulleys, as well as a stable anchor point at the top of the building. By attaching the ropes to the pulleys and using the pulleys to change the direction of the force, you could slowly and safely lift people up the building. This approach would be more time-consuming and physically demanding than using an elevator, but it could be a viable option in a situation where elevators are not working.",
    "Personal Glider: If you had access to a lightweight, flexible material like silk or nylon, you could create a personal glider that could be used to glide up the side of the skyscraper. This would require some knowledge of aerodynamics and the ability to design and construct a stable glider. By attaching the glider to a harness and using the wind currents to lift you up the building, you could potentially reach the top. However, this approach would be extremely dangerous and could result in serious injury or death if not executed properly.",
    "Abseiling: If you have access to a rope and some basic climbing gear, you could use abseiling techniques to descend the side of the skyscraper. By attaching a rope to a secure anchor point at the top of the building and using the rope to control your descent, you could potentially reach the ground safely. This approach would require some climbing experience and knowledge of abseiling techniques, but it could be a viable option in a situation where elevators are not working.",
    "Emergency Stairwell Access: In some cases, skyscrapers may have emergency stairwells that can be accessed in the event of an elevator failure. These stairwells are typically located near the base of the building"
