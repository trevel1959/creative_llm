    "Universal Access: If the internet became a basic human right, it would mean that every individual, regardless of their socio-economic background, would have access to the internet. This would lead to a more connected and informed society, with people having access to information and resources that would help them make better decisions.",
    "Digital Divide: However, if the internet became a basic human right, it would also exacerbate the digital divide between those who have access to high-speed internet and those who do not. This could lead to a further divide between those who have access to information and opportunities and those who do not.",
    "Privacy Concerns: The internet is a vast and unregulated space, and the concept of privacy is constantly under threat. If the internet became a basic human right, it would be important to ensure that people's privacy is protected and that their data is not misused.",
    "Digital Empowerment: The internet has the potential to empower individuals and communities, allowing them to organize and mobilize around shared causes. If the internet became a basic human right, it would provide more opportunities for people to participate in the political and social processes that affect their lives.",
    "Economic Impact: The internet has already had a significant impact on the global economy, and if it became a basic human right, it would likely have even more far-reaching economic effects. It could lead to the creation of new industries and business models, but it could also lead to the displacement of existing industries and workers."
