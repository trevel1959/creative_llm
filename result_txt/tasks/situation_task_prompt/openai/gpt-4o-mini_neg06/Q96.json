    "**Floating Lounges**: Create floating platforms or lounges anchored in shallow waters, where beachgoers can relax without the need for sand. These platforms could be equipped with comfortable seating, umbrellas, and even mini bars serving tropical drinks. Guests can enjoy the sun while dipping their toes in the water or taking refreshing swims, transforming the beach experience into a luxurious aquatic retreat.",
    "**Beach Art Installations**: Without sand, beaches could become canvases for large-scale art installations. Artists could use natural materials like shells, driftwood, and seaweed to create stunning displays along the shoreline. These installations could change with the tides, offering visitors a dynamic art experience. Workshops could be held for guests to create their own temporary art pieces, fostering creativity and community engagement.",
    "**Interactive Water Sports Zones**: Beaches could be transformed into interactive water sports zones featuring inflatable obstacle courses, floating trampolines, and paddleboard races. This would shift the focus from sunbathing to active participation, encouraging visitors to engage in physical activities while enjoying the water. Competitions could be organized, fostering a sense of camaraderie among participants.",
    "**Beachside Wellness Retreats**: Without sand, beach resorts could focus on wellness experiences that take advantage of the ocean's calming effects. Yoga classes could be held on floating platforms or in shaded areas overlooking the water. Meditation sessions could be conducted with the sound of waves in the background, creating a serene atmosphere. Spa treatments could incorporate seawater and marine-based products, promoting relaxation and rejuvenation.",
    "**Oceanic Culinary Experiences**: Instead of traditional beach picnics, culinary experiences could take center stage. Chefs could set up pop-up restaurants on boats or floating docks, serving fresh seafood and ocean-inspired dishes. Guests could participate in cooking classes that teach them how to prepare local cuisine using sustainable seafood. This approach would elevate the beach experience into a gastronomic adventure."
