    "**Modular Skateboard Design**: Create a skateboard with a modular design where users can easily swap out parts such as wheels, decks, and trucks based on their preferences or riding style. This would allow for customization to enhance performance for street skating, cruising, or tricks, making it versatile for different types of skaters.",
    "**Built-in Bluetooth Speakers**: Design a skateboard that includes built-in Bluetooth speakers. This feature would allow riders to listen to music or podcasts while skating, enhancing their experience. The speakers could be weather-resistant and positioned in a way that doesnâ€™t interfere with the rider's balance or movement.",
    "**Eco-Friendly Skateboard**: Develop a skateboard made from sustainable materials such as bamboo or recycled plastics. Additionally, incorporate solar panels on the deck to charge a small battery that could power LED lights for visibility at night or the aforementioned Bluetooth speakers, promoting an eco-conscious approach to skating.",
    "**Integrated Safety Gear**: Create a skateboard that comes with built-in safety features, such as a helmet that attaches magnetically to the board when not in use. The helmet could have a collapsible design for easy storage and include smart technology, such as impact sensors that alert the user if they fall, sending a message to emergency contacts.",
    "**Self-Balancing Technology**: Innovate a skateboard that uses self-balancing technology similar to that found in hoverboards. This would help beginners learn to skate without the fear of falling, as the board would automatically adjust to keep the rider upright. Advanced riders could disable the feature for a more traditional experience."
