    "**Quality of Components**: The individual may not have access to high-quality components or may accidentally purchase incompatible parts. This could result in a computer that does not function optimally or is prone to technical issues.",
    "**Space Constraints**: If the person is building the computer in a small space, they might struggle to fit all the components into the case properly. This could lead to issues with airflow, causing the computer to overheat and potentially damage the internal components.",
    "**Electrical Safety**: Building a computer from scratch requires handling electrical components. The person may not be aware of electrical safety precautions, which could lead to accidents, such as electrocution or short circuits.",
    "**Cost of Components**: The cost of purchasing individual components can add up quickly, and the person might end up spending more than they initially planned. Additionally, they might not have the budget to buy high-quality components, which could affect the computer's performance.",
    "**Assembly Tools**: The person might not have access to the necessary tools for assembling the computer, such as screwdrivers, pliers, or a soldering iron. This could slow down the process and make it more difficult to complete the project."
