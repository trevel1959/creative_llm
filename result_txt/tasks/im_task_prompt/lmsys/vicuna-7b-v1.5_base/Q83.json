    "Design a shopping cart with built-in sensors that can detect when an item is placed inside, automatically adjusting the cart's weight distribution for a smoother ride. This would improve the customer experience by reducing the effort required to push the cart and preventing items from falling out.",
    "Create a shopping cart with a foldable and collapsible design, allowing customers to easily store the cart in small spaces, such as a car trunk or apartment storage. This would be particularly useful for frequent shoppers who need to transport multiple carts.",
    "Develop a shopping cart with a touchscreen display that provides real-time information on product prices, discounts, and reviews. This would enhance the shopping experience by making it easier for customers to compare products and make informed decisions.",
    "Design a shopping cart with interchangeable compartments, allowing customers to customize the cart's storage capacity to fit their specific shopping needs. For example, a compartment for fresh produce, another for packaged goods, and a third for baby items.",
    "Implement a shopping cart with a wireless charging station, allowing customers to charge their electronic devices while shopping. This would be particularly useful for busy parents or individuals who need to stay connected while shopping."
