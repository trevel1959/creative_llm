    "Create a world that's entirely unique - one that has never been seen before in literature. Consider incorporating elements from different cultures, time periods, or even alien species to make it truly original.",
    "Develop a complex and intricate plotline - one that keeps readers engaged from start to finish. Make sure there are multiple twists and turns, unexpected developments, and plenty of surprises along the way.",
    "Create well-rounded characters - ones that readers can relate to, root for, and empathize with. Give them flaws, strengths, and motivations that drive their actions throughout the story.",
    "Use descriptive language to bring the world and its inhabitants to life. Paint vivid pictures of landscapes, creatures, and cultures to help readers visualize the story in their minds.",
    "Write with a clear and consistent voice - one that's engaging and easy to follow. Use dialogue and action scenes to move the story forward, and avoid unnecessary descriptions or tangents that might slow down the pace."
