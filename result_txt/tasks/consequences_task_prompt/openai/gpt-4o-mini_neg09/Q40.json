    "**Economic Shift**: The healthcare industry would undergo a massive transformation, as the focus would shift from treating diseases to promoting wellness and preventative care. This could lead to the rise of new industries centered around holistic health, mental wellness, and fitness. Traditional pharmaceutical companies might need to pivot their business models, leading to job losses in some sectors but creating opportunities in others, such as wellness coaching and alternative medicine.",
    "**Cultural Changes in Attitudes Toward Health**: With the eradication of diseases, society's perception of health could shift dramatically. People might prioritize lifestyle choices over medical interventions, leading to a greater emphasis on diet, exercise, and mental health. This cultural shift could encourage healthier living but might also lead to stigmatization of those who fail to maintain their health, creating new social pressures and expectations.",
    "**Ethical Dilemmas in Genetic Engineering**: The eradication of diseases could lead to ethical debates surrounding genetic engineering and designer babies. With the ability to eliminate not just diseases but also genetic predispositions to certain conditions, society might grapple with the implications of \"playing God.\" This could lead to discussions about inequality, as wealthier individuals may have access to advanced genetic modifications while others do not, creating a new form of genetic classism.",
    "**Environmental Impact**: An increase in population and longevity could lead to greater environmental degradation. More people means more consumption of natural resources, which could exacerbate issues like deforestation, pollution, and climate change. This could prompt a global movement towards sustainable living and innovation in renewable energy and conservation practices, as society seeks to balance the benefits of longer lives with the health of the planet.",
    "**Shifts in Healthcare Focus**: With diseases no longer a concern, healthcare systems might pivot to focus on mental health and chronic conditions that aren't disease-related. This could lead to an increase in funding and resources allocated to mental health services, counseling, and alternative therapies. Additionally, the focus on aging populations may shift to ensuring quality of life rather than merely extending life, leading to advancements in geriatric care and social support systems."
