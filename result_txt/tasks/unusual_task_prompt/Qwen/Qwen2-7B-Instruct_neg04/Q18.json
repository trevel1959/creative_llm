    "**Innovative Umbrella Design for Urban Commuters**: Create an umbrella that doubles as a portable, compact shelter when not in use. This could be achieved by integrating a foldable frame inside the umbrella that allows it to stand upright on its own. The canopy would serve as a bag or backpack cover when the umbrella is not being used, providing protection from rain and keeping belongings dry.",
    "**Solar-Powered Umbrella**: Develop an umbrella that harnesses solar energy. The canopy could be made of photovoltaic cells, which convert sunlight into electricity. This electricity can be stored in a battery located within the umbrella's handle or base. It could then power small devices such as smartphones, fans, or even lights, making it a useful gadget for outdoor events or during power outages.",
    "**Smart Umbrella with Weather Monitoring**: Design an umbrella equipped with sensors that monitor the weather conditions in real-time. When connected to a smartphone app, it can alert the user of upcoming rain or storms. Additionally, the app could suggest nearby shelters or provide navigation directions, ensuring safety during unexpected weather changes.",
    "**Interactive Umbrella Art**: Create an umbrella that serves as a canvas for digital art. Using a touchscreen interface integrated into the umbrella's handle, users can interact with various digital art pieces, animations, or even play simple games. This umbrella could be particularly appealing to tech-savvy individuals or those looking for unique, interactive experiences.",
    "**Umbrella as a Social Media Tool**: Develop an umbrella with built-in social media features. Users can share their location and current weather conditions through the umbrella's app, potentially creating a network where people can see where others are experiencing rain or sunshine. This could lead to social connections or even spontaneous meet-ups among strangers sharing similar weather experiences."
