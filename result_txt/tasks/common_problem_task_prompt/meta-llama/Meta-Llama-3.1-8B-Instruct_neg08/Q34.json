    "**Safety Concerns**: The robot may pose a risk to humans and other living beings, especially if it is not designed with safety features or is programmed to prioritize tasks over human safety. For example, a robot designed to clean floors may accidentally knock over a human or other object, causing injury or damage.",
    "**Cybersecurity Threats**: The robot may be vulnerable to cyber attacks, allowing hackers to access and control the robot remotely, potentially causing harm to humans or disrupting critical systems. This could be particularly problematic if the robot is connected to the internet or has access to sensitive information.",
    "**Dependence on Human Interaction**: The robot may require frequent maintenance or repairs, which could lead to dependence on human interaction and potential delays in completing tasks. This could be especially problematic if the robot is designed to perform critical tasks that require immediate attention.",
    "**Social Acceptance and Integration**: The robot may not be accepted by society, leading to social isolation and potential negative consequences for the robot and its users. For instance, a robot designed to interact with humans may be perceived as creepy or unsettling, leading to social rejection.",
    "**Environmental Impact**: The robot may have a significant environmental impact, such as energy consumption, waste generation, or resource depletion, which could lead to negative consequences for the environment and human health."
