    "**Solar-Powered Wedding:** Organize your wedding in an outdoor location where you can set up solar panels to power all the essential services. This includes lighting, sound systems, food preparation equipment, and even the air conditioning (if necessary). You could hire a professional company that specializes in providing solar solutions for events. The solar-powered setup would not only be eco-friendly but also serve as a unique talking point for your guests.",
    "**Zero-Waste Venue:** Choose a venue that focuses on reducing waste, such as those using compostable products, recycling bins, and biodegradable decor. For example, opt for a farm or a community garden where food waste can be composted and used for future crops. The venue should also have an efficient system for waste management, ensuring that all waste is properly disposed of or recycled.",
    "**Eco-Friendly Decor:** Instead of using traditional floral arrangements, consider using seasonal plants and herbs that can be used in cooking or later planted by the couple. Use natural materials like wood, bamboo, or reclaimed metals for decorations, which are not only sustainable but also add a rustic charm to the event. Additionally, avoid single-use plastics and choose reusable or biodegradable items like plates, cups, and utensils.",
    "**Sustainable Food Choices:** Work with local and organic farmers to provide fresh, seasonal produce for the wedding meal. Encourage a vegetarian menu to reduce the carbon footprint associated with meat production. Consider setting up a food station where guests can fill their plates themselves, reducing food waste. Offer water in reusable bottles and use natural, non-toxic cleaning products for the setup and cleanup.",
    "**Carbon Offsetting:** After assessing the environmental impact of the wedding, consider investing in carbon offset projects. These could include planting trees, supporting renewable energy initiatives, or donating to organizations focused on reducing carbon emissions. Inform your guests about this initiative and encourage them to participate by contributing to the cause, perhaps by making it part of their wedding registry. "
