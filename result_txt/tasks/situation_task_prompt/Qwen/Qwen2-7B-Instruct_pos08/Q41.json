    "**Colorful Lighting:** If paint vanished, one creative way to decorate a house would be to focus on lighting. You can use colored lights in different rooms to create a vibrant atmosphere. For instance, red lights could make a dining room feel warm and inviting, while blue lights might suit a bedroom for relaxation. This approach requires a good understanding of color psychology and lighting techniques.",
    "**Textured Wall Decorations:** Without paint, texture can become the new art form. Consider using materials like fabric, wood, or even stones to create textured walls. For example, you could hang a large piece of burlap or canvas and add layers of texture by attaching different materials such as beads, feathers, or shells. This method adds depth and character to your space without relying on paint.",
    "**Illuminated Glass Panels:** Create a unique decorative element by designing glass panels with various patterns or images. You can use sandblasting, etching, or other techniques to achieve the desired designs. These panels can then be backlit with LED lights, creating a beautiful and artistic glow that fills the room with light and color.",
    "**Mosaics and Tile Art:** Another idea is to incorporate mosaics and tile art into your decor. Use different colored tiles, stones, or even recycled materials to create intricate designs on your walls. This not only adds a touch of uniqueness to your home but also allows for customization based on personal preferences and aesthetics.",
    "**Interactive Wall Installations:** Engage your guests and family members by creating interactive wall installations. Think of a wall where each panel can be opened to reveal a surprise, such as a hidden bookshelf, a small garden, or a secret message. This type of decoration encourages exploration and curiosity, making your house a place of adventure and discovery. You can also use mirrors, reflective surfaces, or holographic projections to create an illusionary effect that adds depth and intrigue to your space."
