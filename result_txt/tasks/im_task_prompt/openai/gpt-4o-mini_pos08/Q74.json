    "**Adjustable Spout**: Design a watering can with an adjustable spout that can change its angle and flow rate. Users can twist or slide the spout to customize the water flow according to the size of the plant or the area being watered. This would make it easier to water delicate seedlings or larger potted plants without spilling.",
    "**Built-in Water Filter**: Incorporate a water filtration system within the watering can that filters out impurities from tap water. This could be particularly beneficial for indoor plants that are sensitive to chemicals and chlorine. The filter could be easily replaceable, ensuring clean water for the plants.",
    "**Ergonomic Handle with Grip**: Create an ergonomic handle that features a non-slip grip and adjustable position. This would make it easier for users to hold and maneuver the watering can, especially when itâ€™s full. The handle could also have a cushioned grip to reduce strain on the hands and wrists during extended use.",
    "**Color-Coded Watering Levels**: Implement a color-coded measurement system on the side of the watering can to indicate different water levels. This would help users quickly gauge how much water is left and how much they are using, making it easier to plan watering schedules and avoid waste.",
    "**Multi-Purpose Cap**: Design a cap that serves multiple functions. One side could have a standard opening for pouring, while the other could have a spray nozzle attachment for gentle misting. This would allow users to switch between watering and misting without needing to use two separate tools, making it versatile for different types of plants."
