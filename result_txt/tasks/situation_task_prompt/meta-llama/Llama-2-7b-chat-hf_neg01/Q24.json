    "Augmented Reality Glasses: In a world without glasses or contact lenses, people with poor vision could turn to augmented reality (AR) glasses as an alternative. AR glasses use a see-through display to superimpose digital information and images onto the wearer's real-world view. With AR glasses, people with poor vision could still see the world around them clearly, while also having access to enhanced visual information such as magnified images, text, or even virtual guides to help them navigate their surroundings.",
    "Brain-Computer Interfaces: Another solution for people with poor vision could be brain-computer interfaces (BCIs). BCIs use sensors to detect electrical signals in the brain and translate them into digital commands. With a BCI, people with poor vision could control digital devices such as computers or smartphones with their thoughts, allowing them to access information and communicate with others without the need for visual aids.",
    "Artificial Retinas: Scientists could develop artificial retinas that could be implanted in the eyes of people with poor vision. These artificial retinas would use microchips and light-sensitive materials to mimic the function of a healthy retina, allowing people to see the world around them once again. The artificial retinas could also be programmed to enhance certain aspects of vision, such as color perception or contrast sensitivity, to improve the wearer's quality of life.",
    "Smart Contact Lenses: Instead of traditional contact lenses, people with poor vision could turn to smart contact lenses that have built-in sensors and microchips. These smart contact lenses could monitor the wearer's eye health and vision in real-time, providing instant feedback and suggestions for improving their vision. They could also be programmed to provide virtual displays or enhance certain aspects of vision, such as contrast sensitivity or color perception."
