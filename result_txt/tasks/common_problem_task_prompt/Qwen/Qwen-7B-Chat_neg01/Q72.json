    "Utilize ocean waves to generate electricity: A power plant could be built near the coast, using turbines that rotate as the waves crash against them. The force of the waves would turn the turbines, which would then generate electricity.",
    "Harness the power of wind: Similar to ocean wave power, a wind turbine farm could be constructed in areas with high winds. The blades of the turbines would spin as the wind blows, generating electricity.",
    "Build a solar-powered desalination plant: With the increasing demand for clean water, a solar-powered desalination plant could be built to extract salt from seawater. The sun's energy would heat the water, causing it to evaporate, leaving behind pure water.",
    "Create a geothermal power plant: Geothermal energy is generated by tapping into the Earth's internal heat. A power plant could be built near a geothermal vent, where hot water and steam rise to the surface. The steam would turn turbines, generating electricity.",
    "Use biomass to create biofuels: Biomass refers to organic matter, such as wood chips or agricultural waste. This material can be converted into biofuels, such as ethanol or biodiesel, which can be used as an alternative to fossil fuels. Building a power plant that uses biomass to create biofuels would help reduce our reliance on non-renewable resources."
