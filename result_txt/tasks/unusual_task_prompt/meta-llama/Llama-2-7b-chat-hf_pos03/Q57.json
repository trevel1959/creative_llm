    "Perfume Bottle with Built-in Fragrance Releaser: Create a perfume bottle with a built-in fragrance releaser, allowing the user to control the amount of fragrance released.

The bottle could have a series of slots or compartments that contain different fragrance oils, each with its own unique scent.

This would provide a fun and creative way for users to experiment with different fragrances and find their perfect scent.",
