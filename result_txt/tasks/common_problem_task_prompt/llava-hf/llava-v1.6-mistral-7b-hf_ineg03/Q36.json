    "Aesthetics and Architectural Design: The visual impact of solar panels on the exterior of homes may be a concern. Some residents might not appreciate the aesthetic changes that solar panels bring to their homes, leading to potential conflicts between homeowners and solar panel installers.",
    "Cost: The cost of installing solar panels in every home could be a significant barrier. The cost of purchasing and installing solar panels, as well as the associated battery storage systems, might be too high for some residents, particularly those on lower incomes.",
    "Maintenance and Lifespan: Solar panels require regular maintenance, including cleaning and inspection, to ensure optimal performance. As the number of solar panels increases, there may be a shortage of qualified technicians to perform these tasks, leading to delays and increased costs.",
    "Environmental Impact: The production and disposal of solar panels have an environmental impact, including the use of rare earth materials and the generation of electronic waste. The increased demand for solar panels could exacerbate these issues, leading to a need for more sustainable and environmentally friendly manufacturing processes.",
    "Grid Integration: As more homes generate solar power, there may be challenges in integrating this renewable energy source into the existing electrical grid. This could require significant upgrades to the power infrastructure, which might be expensive and time-consuming."
