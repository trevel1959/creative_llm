    "No More Pain: Regeneration would eliminate the need for pain management during the healing process, making the recovery experience less stressful and less painful.",
    "Reduced Risk of Infection: With a natural regenerative process, the risk of infection would be minimized as the body would not require the use of foreign materials like implants or grafts.",
    "Improved Tissue Function: Regenerated limbs would likely have improved tissue function, allowing for better overall mobility and strength compared to limbs that have undergone traditional surgical procedures.",
    "Increased Self-Reliance: The ability to regenerate limbs would increase a person's self-reliance, as they would no longer need to rely on prosthetics or assistive devices for mobility.",
    "Potential for Organ Donation: The ability to regenerate limbs could potentially revolutionize organ donation, as a person could regenerate a new limb to replace a damaged one, making organs more readily available for transplant."
