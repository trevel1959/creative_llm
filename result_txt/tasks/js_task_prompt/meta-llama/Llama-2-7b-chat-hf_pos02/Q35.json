    "Woolly Mammoth: With the ongoing climate change, the Woolly Mammoth would be an excellent choice for revival. These creatures were well adapted to the cold climates of the Ice Age and could help in preserving the arctic ecosystem. They would also provide an additional source of food, as their meat and fur would be highly valued for their nutritional and thermal properties. Additionally, their large size and strength would make them useful for heavy labor, such as snow removal and construction.",
    "Quagga: The Quagga, a subspecies of the Plains Zebra, was hunted to extinction in the late 19th century. With their distinctive stripes and social behavior, they would be a fascinating addition to modern ecosystems. They could help maintain the balance of grazing in grasslands and savannas, and their stripes could act as a form of camouflage in the wild. Moreover, their intelligence and social nature would make them an interesting study subject for scientists.",
    "Passenger Pigeon: Once the most abundant bird species in North America, the Passenger Pigeon went extinct in 1914 due to overhunting. Reviving this species would not only help restore the ecological balance of forests but also provide valuable insights into the impact of human activities on the environment. As a highly social bird, they would be an important part of the ecosystem, serving as seed dispersers and pollinators. Their ability to adapt to different habitats would also make them an excellent candidate for reintroduction into various ecosystems.",
    "Tasmanian Tiger: The Tasmanian Tiger, also known as the Thylacine, was a carnivorous marsupial that went extinct in the early 20th century. Their unique appearance, with a combination of features from both dogs and kangaroos, would make them an interesting addition to modern ecosystems. They would help maintain the balance of predator and prey populations, and their scavenging habits would contribute to the cleanliness of the environment. Moreover, their intelligence and adaptability would make them an important study subject for scientists.",
