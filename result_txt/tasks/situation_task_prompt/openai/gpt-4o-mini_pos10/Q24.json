    "**Augmented Reality (AR) Contact Implants**: Instead of traditional contact lenses, a new technology could involve the implantation of tiny AR devices directly into the eye. These implants would project visual information onto the retina, compensating for poor vision. Users could control the level of magnification or correction through a smartphone app, tailoring their vision needs for different environments, such as reading or driving.",
    "**Vision-Correcting Tattoos**: Inspired by the idea of body art, scientists could create a special type of tattoo that alters the surface of the eye. This tattoo would use biocompatible inks that interact with light to enhance vision. The tattoo would be applied in a safe and sterile environment and could provide long-lasting effects, potentially reducing the need for external vision aids.",
    "**Smart Glasses with Dynamic Vision Correction**: Although traditional glasses are gone, smart glasses could be developed that utilize advanced sensors and algorithms to adjust the lens properties in real-time. These glasses would analyze the user's environment and automatically modify the lens curvature to provide optimal vision correction based on distance, lighting, and focus requirements.",
    "**Community Vision Cooperatives**: In the absence of glasses and contact lenses, communities could establish vision cooperatives where members share resources and knowledge about vision improvement techniques. These cooperatives could offer workshops on eye exercises, nutrition for eye health, and alternative vision aids like pinhole glasses or visual aids made from readily available materials.",
    "**Vision Therapy Programs**: Without traditional corrective lenses, vision therapy could gain prominence. Professionals would develop tailored programs that focus on improving visual skills through exercises and activities. These programs would emphasize strengthening eye muscles, improving focus and coordination, and teaching techniques to maximize residual vision."
