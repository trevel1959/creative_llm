    "Self-Cleaning Washing Machine: Design a washing machine with a self-cleaning feature that uses ultraviolet light or steam to eliminate bacteria and odors after each use. This would help maintain a clean and hygienic environment inside the machine, ensuring that clothes remain fresh and clean without the need for frequent cleaning by the user.",
    "Customizable Wash Cycles: Offer users the ability to create and save personalized wash cycles tailored to specific fabrics, such as delicate garments, towels, or heavily soiled items. The washing machine could then recommend or suggest these custom cycles based on the load being washed, resulting in more efficient and effective cleaning.",
    "Integrated Drying Function: Combine the washing machine with a drying function to create a compact, all-in-one appliance. This would save space in the home and reduce the need for separate laundry rooms or additional appliances. The integrated dryer could use advanced technologies like infrared heating or steam drying to ensure fast and efficient drying without damaging clothes.",
    "Eco-Friendly Washing Machine: Develop a washing machine that incorporates sustainable features, such as water-saving modes, energy-efficient motors, and biodegradable detergent dispensers. This would not only reduce the environmental impact but also appeal to eco-conscious consumers looking to minimize their carbon footprint.",
    "Interactive User Interface: Enhance the user interface of the washing machine with interactive displays and touch screens. Users could easily navigate through different settings, view real-time progress of the wash cycle, and even access online tutorials or tips for optimal laundry care. This could also include features like virtual assistant integration, allowing users to interact with the machine through a mobile app or voice commands."
