    "\"Energy Ball\" - A new type of energy that can be stored in small, spherical balls that can be used for a variety of purposes. These energy balls can be charged using solar panels or other renewable sources of energy and can be used to power small devices or even entire homes. They can be thrown or rolled to generate electricity, making them a fun and practical way to harness the power of renewable energy.",
    "\"Nano-Energy\" - A new type of energy that can be generated at the nanoscale. Nano-energy can be created by manipulating theerer of tiny particles, such as atoms and molecules. This energy can be used to power small devices, such as watches and phones, or even entire buildings. Nano-energy is a clean and efficient way to harness the power of the atom, making it a promising new source of energy for the future.",
    "\"Wave Energy\" - A new type of energy that can be generated by harnessing the power of ocean waves. Wave energy can be captured using large turbines that are placed underwater, where they can generate electricity as the waves pass over them. This energy can be used to power homes, businesses, and even entire cities, making it a clean and sustainable source of energy for the future.",
    "\"Solar Energy\" - A new type of energy that can be generated using solar panels. Solar energy can be harnessed from the sun's rays and used to power a variety of devices, from small electronics to entire buildings. This energy is clean, renewable, and abundant, making it a promising new source of energy for the future.",
    "\"Fusion Energy\" - A new type of energy that can be generated byer combining the nuclei of atoms. Fusion energy can be harnessed by creatinger a nuclear reactor that uses powerful magnetic fields to bring the nuclei of atoms together. Thiser createser a massive explosion of energy that can be used to power homes, businesses, and even entire cities. Fusion energy is a clean and sustainable source of energy that has the potential to revolutionize the way we power our world."
