    "Create a virtual reality skiing experience using ski poles as the primary input device. Users can don VR headsets and use their ski poles to navigate through a virtual ski resort, interacting with other skiers and the environment around them. The poles could also be used to perform tricks and stunts, adding an extra layer of immersion to the experience.",
    "Develop an app that uses the ski poles as a controller for a mobile game. Players can use their poles to move their character on the screen, interact with objects and enemies, and perform special moves. The app could also track the player's movements in real-time, allowing them to use their poles to control their character in a more intuitive way.",
    "Design a set of exercise routines specifically tailored to skiers, using the ski poles as a primary training tool. The routines could include strength training exercises to improve grip and endurance, balance and coordination exercises, and even yoga routines to improve flexibility and core strength. The idea is to create a full-body workout that would complement skiing and help skiers perform better on the slopes.",
    "Create a social media platform that connects skiers and allows them to share their experiences and adventures using their ski poles. Users can take photos and videos of their skiing adventures and share them on the platform, using their poles to create unique and creative content. The platform could also include features such as a leaderboard, allowing users to compete with each other and show off their skills.",
    "Develop a smart ski pole system that uses sensors and GPS to track a skier's performance and provide real-time feedback on their technique. The system could include features such as a virtual coach that provides tips and advice on how to improve, or a leaderboard that shows the skier's position relative to other skiers in the area. The system could also include a safety feature that alerts emergency services if the skier falls or is injured."
