    "I would put a sign around my neck saying, \"This is me, not you.\"",
    "I would have to draw people around me.  I would say my name was the same as theirs and my middle initial would be the same as theirs and tell them the address I lived at.",
    "I would put my name on everything I wear.  I would have my name on my underwear, socks, shirt and pants.  I would have an emblem or symbol to identify me that no one else would ever have that would be personal to me only.",
    "I would keep my friends up late at night and tell them all my dirty secrets.",
    "I would put big ugly letters on my head that would the name of the person who I wish I could be."
