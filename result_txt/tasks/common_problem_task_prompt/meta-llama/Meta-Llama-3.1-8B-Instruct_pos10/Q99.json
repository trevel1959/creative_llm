    "**SmartCane**: A 3D-printed, AI-powered cane that detects and navigates around obstacles in the user's path. Equipped with sensors and a camera, SmartCane uses computer vision and machine learning algorithms to identify and avoid hazards, providing real-time feedback through vibrations, audio cues, or haptic feedback.",
    "**ECHO**: An AI-driven, wearable device that converts visual information into tactile sensations. ECHO uses electroencephalography (EEG) sensors to detect the user's brain activity and translates visual data into a tactile representation, allowing the visually impaired to \"feel\" images, shapes, and patterns.",
    "**VizTalk**: A smart, wearable device that uses augmented reality (AR) and machine learning to provide real-time descriptions of the user's surroundings. VizTalk uses computer vision to identify objects, people, and environments, and generates audio descriptions using a natural language processing (NLP) engine, allowing the visually impaired to navigate and interact with their environment in a more immersive way.",
    "**SoundScout**: A portable, AI-powered device that uses sound waves to create a 3D map of the user's surroundings. SoundScout uses ultrasonic sensors to detect objects and obstacles, and generates a unique sound pattern for each item, allowing the visually impaired to build a mental map of their environment through auditory cues.",
    "**TactiLens**: A smart, wearable lens that uses electrooculography (EOG) sensors to detect the user's eye movements and translate visual information into tactile sensations. TactiLens uses machine learning algorithms to identify patterns and shapes, and generates a tactile representation of the visual data, allowing the visually impaired to \"feel\" images and text in real-time. </s> "
