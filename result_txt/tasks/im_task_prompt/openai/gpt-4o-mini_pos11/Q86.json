    "**Adaptive Terrain Wheels**: Design wheels that can automatically adjust their grip and traction based on the terrain. Using smart sensors, the wheelchair could detect surfaces such as grass, gravel, or ramps and alter the wheel's pressure and surface texture accordingly. This would provide a smoother ride and improve stability and safety on uneven or challenging terrains.",
    "**Personalized Comfort and Posture System**: Implement a customizable seating system that uses smart textiles and adjustable components to conform to the user's body shape and posture. The system could incorporate sensors to monitor posture and automatically adjust the seat, backrest, and armrests for optimal comfort and support, reducing the risk of pressure sores and promoting better posture.",
    "**Integrated Health Monitoring**: Equip wheelchairs with health monitoring technology that tracks vital signs such as heart rate, blood pressure, and oxygen levels. The data could be displayed on a mobile app or directly on the wheelchair's control panel. This would allow users and caregivers to monitor health in real-time, alerting them to any concerning changes and enabling proactive healthcare management.",
    "**Solar-Powered Charging System**: Develop a wheelchair that includes solar panels integrated into the design, allowing it to harness solar energy to recharge its battery. This eco-friendly feature would extend the wheelchair's range and reduce dependency on external power sources, making it ideal for outdoor use and long trips.",
    "**Social Connectivity Features**: Create a built-in communication system that allows users to connect with friends, family, or support groups through voice commands or a simple interface. This could include video calling capabilities, social media integration, and alerts for messages or notifications, promoting social interaction and reducing feelings of isolation."
