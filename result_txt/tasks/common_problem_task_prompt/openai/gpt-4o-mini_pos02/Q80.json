    "**Eco-Conscious Invitations**: Traditional wedding invitations often involve paper that contributes to deforestation and waste. The challenge lies in finding creative alternatives that are still beautiful and personal. Couples could explore digital invitations, seed paper (which can be planted after use), or recycled materials. They can also emphasize a minimalistic design to reduce paper usage while still conveying their wedding theme.",
    "**Sustainable Catering Options**: Sourcing food that is both delicious and eco-friendly can be tricky. Couples may face difficulties in finding caterers who use local, organic, and seasonal ingredients. Additionally, managing food waste can be a concern. To tackle this, couples can opt for caterers specializing in farm-to-table cuisine, create a menu that minimizes waste (like using whole vegetables), and partner with local food banks to donate any excess food after the event.",
    "**Eco-Friendly Attire**: Wedding attire can be a significant source of environmental impact, especially with the fast fashion industry. Couples may struggle to find sustainable options for wedding dresses and suits. Solutions include renting outfits, purchasing from ethical brands that prioritize sustainable materials, or even upcycling vintage clothing. This not only reduces waste but also adds a unique touch to the wedding.",
    "**Transportation Challenges**: The logistics of getting guests to and from the wedding venue can lead to increased carbon emissions. Couples may find it challenging to coordinate eco-friendly transportation options. To mitigate this, they could arrange for a shuttle service using electric or hybrid vehicles, encourage carpooling among guests, or choose a venue that is easily accessible by public transport.",
    "**Waste Management**: Weddings can generate a lot of waste, from decor to food packaging. A significant problem could be ensuring that waste is minimized and properly managed. Couples can implement a waste management plan that includes recycling and composting stations at the venue, using biodegradable decorations, and encouraging guests to bring reusable containers for leftovers. This approach promotes sustainability and raises awareness among attendees."
