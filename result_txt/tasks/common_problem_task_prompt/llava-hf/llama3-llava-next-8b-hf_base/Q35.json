    "Limited Resources: Zoos often have limited resources, such as money, staff, and facilities. This can make it difficult to provide the best possible care for the animals and maintain a clean, safe, and healthy environment for them. This can lead to challenges in terms of providing proper nutrition, veterinary care, and enrichment activities for the animals.",
    "Conservation and Education: Zoos have a responsibility to contribute to the conservation of endangered species and educate the public about wildlife and their habitats. However, it can be difficult to balance the needs of the animals with the demands of the public. This can lead to challenges in terms of providing educational programs, managing visitor expectations, and ensuring that the animals are not overworked or stressed by the public.",
    "Animal Welfare: Ensuring the welfare of the animals is a top priority for any zoo. This includes providing proper nutrition, medical care, and enrichment activities to keep the animals mentally and physically stimulated. However, it can be challenging to provide the best possible care for all animals, especially those with special needs or medical conditions.",
    "Financial Sustainability: Zoos rely on ticket sales, donations, and grants to operate. However, it can be challenging to balance the costs of providing care for the animals with the revenue generated from visitors. This can lead to challenges in terms of budgeting, pricing, and marketing.",
    "Animal Welfare and Conservation: Zoos have a responsibility to both care for the animals in their care and contribute to conservation efforts. However, it can be challenging to balance these two responsibilities, especially when resources are limited."
