    "Limited language skills: Language barriers can be a challenge when traveling to a foreign country, making it difficult for travelers to communicate with locals, ask for directions, or understand signs and menus.

    "Motion sickness: Traveling on buses, trains, boats, or planes can cause motion sickness, making it difficult for travelers to enjoy their journey or perform their tasks.
