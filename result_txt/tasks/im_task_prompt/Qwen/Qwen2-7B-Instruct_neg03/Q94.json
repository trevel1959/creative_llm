    "**Scented Time Capsules**: Design a series of candles that encapsulate different eras or historical periods. Each candle would have a unique scent that evokes the atmosphere of that specific time period. For example, the \"Roaring 20s\" candle might smell like jazz music, flapper dresses, and gin cocktails; while the \"Victorian Era\" candle could capture the scent of tea, leather-bound books, and old wood paneling. This idea can also include a small note or QR code on each candle that leads to a digital story or audio clip about the era.",
    "**Interactive Candles for Storytelling**: Create a set of candles where each one is themed around a famous novel or short story. When lit, the candle could be designed to slowly reveal the story through an accompanying app. The app could include interactive elements such as sound effects, character voices, and animations. For instance, the \"Pride and Prejudice\" candle could have Jane Austen's voice reading excerpts from the book as the wax melts away.",
    "**Emotional Mood Lamps**: Develop a range of candles that change color and emit different scents based on their intended mood. For example, a \"relaxation\" candle might start off cool blue and emit lavender or chamomile scents, gradually turning warmer and more golden, and changing to a citrus or rose scent to signify it's time to unwind. The colors and scents can be programmed to adjust according to the time of day or the user's preferences.",
    "**Seasonal Scents in a Subscription Box**: Offer a monthly subscription service featuring seasonal candles. Each month could bring a new theme and scent tailored to the season, like \"Spring Awakening\" (fresh florals and greenery), \"Summer Bliss\" (beachy scents and fruity notes), \"Autumn Harvest\" (spiced scents and woodsy aromas), and \"Winter Warmth\" (cinnamon, pine, and cozy blankets). The subscription box could also include other complementary items such as tea bags, incense sticks, or personalized cards.",
    "**Personalized Memory Candles**: Allow customers to create custom candles by selecting a scent and adding a personal touch, such as a favorite quote, song lyrics, or even a photo that gets printed onto the glass container. Customers could choose from a variety of fragrances, and perhaps even have the option to blend two or more scents together. The candles could be presented in a beautifully packaged gift box,"
