    "**Self-Cleaning Mower Blades**: Design a lawn mower with a built-in self-cleaning system for the blades. After each mowing session, the mower would spray a biodegradable cleaning solution and use a rotating brush mechanism to remove grass clippings and debris from the blades. This would improve cutting efficiency, reduce rust, and extend the life of the mower, all while minimizing the need for manual cleaning.",
    "**Eco-Friendly Electric Mower with Solar Charging**: Create an electric lawn mower that incorporates solar panels on its body for charging. This mower would be designed to run solely on solar power, making it an environmentally friendly option. Users could charge it during the day, allowing it to mow their lawns without drawing power from the grid, reducing their carbon footprint and energy costs.",
    "**Modular Lawn Mower with Attachments**: Introduce a modular lawn mower system that allows users to switch out different attachments based on their needs. For example, attachments could include a mulcher, a dethatcher, or a leaf blower. This would allow users to customize their lawn care experience and save on the need for multiple machines, making it a more efficient and space-saving solution.",
    "**Lawn Mower with Built-In Fertilizer Dispenser**: Innovate a lawn mower that includes a fertilizer dispenser integrated into its design. As the mower cuts the grass, it would also dispense a precise amount of organic fertilizer onto the lawn. This would promote healthier grass growth and eliminate the need for a separate fertilizing process, making lawn care more streamlined and effective.",
    "**Noise-Reducing Technology**: Develop a lawn mower that incorporates advanced noise-reduction technology, such as sound-dampening materials and quieter motors. This would significantly reduce the noise level while mowing, making it more pleasant for users and their neighbors. Additionally, a \"silent mode\" could be included for early morning or late evening mowing, ensuring compliance with noise ordinances."
