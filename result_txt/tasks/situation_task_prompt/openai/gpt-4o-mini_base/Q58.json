    "**Eco-Friendly Insect Repellent Plants**: Cultivate a variety of plants known for their natural pest-repelling properties, such as citronella, marigold, and basil. By creating designated \"pest repellent gardens\" around urban areas and agricultural fields, these plants can naturally deter insects from invading homes and crops. Additionally, the gardens would enhance biodiversity and provide habitats for other small creatures, fostering a healthier ecosystem.",
    "**Automated Insect Traps**: Develop smart, solar-powered insect traps that utilize AI to identify and capture pests based on their flight patterns and behaviors. These traps would be strategically placed in problem areas and would use pheromones or other attractants to lure insects. Once captured, the insects could be safely disposed of or repurposed as organic fertilizer, creating a closed-loop system that minimizes waste.",
    "**Predator Mimicry Robots**: Create robotic devices that mimic the appearance and movements of natural predators (like birds or bats) to scare away pests. These robots could be programmed to emit sounds or movements that simulate hunting behavior, effectively deterring insects without harming them. This would not only keep pest populations in check but also engage communities in the preservation of their environments.",
    "**Insect-Friendly Barriers**: Design and implement insect-friendly barriers made from biodegradable materials that can be used in homes and gardens. These barriers would allow beneficial insects like pollinators to pass through while blocking harmful pests. They could be enhanced with natural repellents or pheromones to further discourage unwanted insects, creating a sustainable way to protect crops and living spaces.",
    "**Natural Pest Management Workshops**: Establish community workshops focused on natural pest management techniques, teaching individuals how to use organic methods such as companion planting, crop rotation, and the use of essential oils. By empowering communities with knowledge, they can effectively manage pests while promoting a healthier ecosystem. These workshops could also encourage local biodiversity by fostering the growth of beneficial insects."
