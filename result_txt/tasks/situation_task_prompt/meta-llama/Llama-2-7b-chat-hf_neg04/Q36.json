    "Aquatic Abode: In a world without chairs, you could find solace in the depths of the ocean. Picture a series of interconnected, underwater domes that provide a comfortable and safe place to sit. The domes would be made of a flexible, transparent material that allows you to see the marine life and colors of the ocean, while still providing a sense of privacy and security.",
    "Cosmic Cradle: Imagine a world where chairs have been replaced by celestial bodies.
