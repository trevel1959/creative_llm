    "**Innovative Pillow Design for Neck Support**: Develop a pillow that can be adjusted according to different sleeping positions (back, side, or stomach). It could have a segmented design with varying degrees of firmness and softness. The user can customize their pillow's shape and support level by simply moving the segments. This would be especially useful for people who suffer from neck pain due to improper sleeping positions.",
    "**Smart Pillow with Sleep Monitoring**: Create a smart pillow that not only provides comfortable support but also monitors sleep quality. It would use sensors to track your sleep patterns, body movements, and breathing. It could provide data about sleep stages, time spent in bed, and suggest improvements to your sleep routine based on the analysis. Users could then access these insights through an app on their phone.",
    "**Pillow for Meditation and Relaxation**: Design a pillow that incorporates sound therapy or aromatherapy to enhance relaxation. The pillow could have built-in speakers to play soothing sounds like ocean waves, rainforest noises, or binaural beats. Additionally, it might contain compartments for essential oils or have a scent diffuser to release calming fragrances when you lie down. This would be beneficial for those who find it difficult to relax or fall asleep.",
    "**Portable and Inflatable Travel Pillow**: Create a lightweight, compact travel pillow that inflates easily and is adjustable to various shapes. It should be made from durable materials that can withstand frequent use. The pillow could also come with a carrying case that doubles as a storage compartment for headphones, eyemasks, or other travel essentials. This would be ideal for long flights or road trips.",
    "**Adjustable Lumbar Support Pillow**: Develop a pillow that targets the lumbar region, providing extra support to alleviate lower back pain. It could be attached to the backrest of a chair or used as a seat cushion. The pillow should have adjustable height and angle settings, allowing users to customize the level of support needed. This would be particularly useful for office workers, gamers, or anyone spending long hours sitting in one position."
