    "**Scenic Routes**: Travelers could take scenic routes that are familiar to them, using recognizable features of the landscape to guide their journey. This approach would be particularly useful in areas with distinct geographical features, such as mountain ranges or coastlines.",
    "**Local Knowledge**: Local residents and communities could share their knowledge of the area, including the location of important landmarks, points of interest, and safe routes. This knowledge could be passed down through generations, serving as a valuable resource in a map-less world.",
    "**Trail Markings**: In some cases, trails could be marked with specific symbols or colors to indicate the direction of travel. This could be done by local authorities or community groups, ensuring that travelers have a clear path to follow.",
    "**Compass**: A compass could still be used to determine direction, although it would not provide information about distance or location. Travelers could use a compass to orient themselves and adjust their course accordingly.",
    "**Geocaching**: Geocaching is a modern-day treasure hunt where participants use GPS coordinates to find hidden containers called \"geocaches.\" While GPS coordinates are no longer available, the concept of geocaching could be adapted to use natural landmarks and other navigational methods to locate hidden caches."
