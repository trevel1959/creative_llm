    "Water: Mars has no liquid water, so obtaining water would be a major challenge. The most feasible solution would be to extract water from Martian soil, but it would require energy and resources.",
    "Gravity: Mars has only 1/3 of Earth's gravity, which could cause difficulties in movement and balance. This could lead to muscle atrophy and affect the human body's ability to adapt to the low-gravity environment.",
    "Temperature Extremes: Mars experiences extreme temperature fluctuations between day and night, which could cause discomfort and even frostbite if not properly managed.",
    "Radiation Exposure: Mars has no magnetic field, so it is exposed to high levels of radiation from the sun and other sources. This could lead to health problems over time, such as skin damage and cancer.",
    "Communication: The distance between Mars and Earth is so vast that communication would be delayed, making it difficult to coordinate activities and receive timely support in case of emergencies."
