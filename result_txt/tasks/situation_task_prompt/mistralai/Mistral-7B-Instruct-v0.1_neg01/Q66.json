    "Brick and mortar: If all natural materials like wood and stone disappeared, we could still build a house using bricks and mortar. This is a traditional building material that has been used for centuries and is still widely available today. We could use bricks for the walls and mortar to hold them together.",
    "Steel and concrete: Another option would be to use steel and concrete to build a house. These materials are strong and durable, and can be used to create a modern, sleek design. We could use steel beams for the frame and concrete for the foundation and walls.",
    "Recycled materials: We could also build a house using recycled materials. This could include things like old tires, plastic bottles, and even old CDs. These materials can be used to create a unique and eco-friendly design.",
    "3D printing: With the advancements in 3D printing technology, we could even print a house using a 3D printer. This would allow us to create a custom design and use a variety of materials, including plastics and metals.",
    "Modular design: Finally, we could build a house using a modular design. This involves breaking the house down into smaller, modular pieces that can be assembled on-site. This would allow us to use a variety of materials, including wood, steel, and concrete, and would also make the construction process more efficient."
