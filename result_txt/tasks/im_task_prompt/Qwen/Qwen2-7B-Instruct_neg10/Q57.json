    "**Gesture Control Enhancement**: Create a mouse that supports advanced hand gestures for controlling not just the cursor but also various functions like scrolling, zooming, and switching applications. For example, a wave of the hand could switch between open windows, while pinching fingers could adjust zoom levels. This would significantly reduce the need for keyboard shortcuts and enhance multitasking efficiency.",
    "**Biometric Integration**: Integrate biometric sensors into the mouse to recognize the user's grip strength, pulse rate, and even typing rhythm. Based on this data, the mouse could adapt its weight, pressure sensitivity, and vibration feedback to optimize comfort and productivity. For instance, during long coding sessions, the mouse could increase its feedback intensity to prevent muscle strain.",
    "**Environmental Awareness System**: Develop a smart mouse that incorporates environmental sensors to monitor light levels, air quality, and even room temperature. It could adjust its backlight brightness, suggest optimal screen brightness, or even remind users to take breaks based on ambient conditions. This would promote healthier computing habits and potentially reduce eye strain and fatigue.",
    "**Voice Command Integration**: Enhance the mouse with voice recognition technology that allows users to give commands like \"scroll up,\" \"open new tab,\" or \"zoom in\" without lifting a finger. This feature could be particularly useful for hands-free operations, such as when working with gloves or during a presentation where both hands are needed elsewhere.",
    "**Ergonomic Adaptability**: Create a mouse that dynamically changes shape and size based on the user's posture and hand movement patterns. Using sensors, it could detect if the user is leaning forward or back and adjust its curvature to maintain ergonomic comfort. This would help prevent repetitive strain injuries (RSIs) and provide a more personalized user experience."
