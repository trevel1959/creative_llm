    "**Voice-Activated Functionality**:    Enhance the calculator with voice recognition technology, allowing users to perform calculations through voice commands. This feature would be particularly useful for individuals with disabilities or those who are multitasking. Users could simply say, \"Calculate the square root of 144,\" and the calculator would respond with the answer, while also reading back the steps taken for transparency.",
    "**Personalized Learning Mode**:    Integrate an AI-driven personalized learning mode that adapts to the user's skill level and learning style. The calculator could provide hints, explanations, and step-by-step solutions to help users understand the underlying principles behind the calculations. This would be especially beneficial for students learning math, as the calculator could track their progress and suggest practice problems tailored to their needs.",
    "**Multi-Function Smart Calculator**:    Create a smart calculator that combines the functionality of a calculator, notepad, and educational app. It could have a touchscreen interface where users can jot down notes, draw diagrams, or graph equations directly on the screen. The calculator would also offer a library of mathematical concepts and formulas, allowing users to access resources while they work through problems.",
    "**Solar-Powered and Eco-Friendly Design**:    Design a solar-powered calculator that incorporates sustainable materials. This eco-friendly calculator would not only reduce reliance on batteries but also promote environmental awareness. Additionally, it could feature a compact design with a foldable solar panel, making it portable and perfect for outdoor use, such as in classrooms or fieldwork.",
    "**Social Sharing and Collaboration Features**:    Introduce a calculator with built-in social sharing capabilities. Users could save their calculations and share them with classmates or colleagues through social media or messaging apps. This feature could include options for collaborative problem-solving, where multiple users can contribute to a calculation in real-time, making it an excellent tool for group projects or study sessions."
