    "**Augmented Reality Display**: Embed a small, high-resolution display on the surfboard that provides real-time information about the wave, including its size, speed, and direction. This would enable surfers to make more informed decisions and improve their overall surfing experience.",
    "**Ergonomic Grip System**: Design a grip system that adjusts to the rider's hand size and shape, providing a secure and comfortable hold on the surfboard. This would reduce fatigue and improve control, especially during long sessions or in rough conditions.",
    "**Self-Healing Deck**: Develop a deck material that can repair minor scratches and dings using a specialized coating or nanotechnology. This would reduce the need for frequent repairs and extend the lifespan of the surfboard.",
    "**Integrated Safety Features**: Incorporate safety features such as a personal locator beacon (PLB), a GPS device, or a collision detection system to alert nearby surfers or emergency services in case of an accident.",
    "**Adjustable Volume Control**: Design a system that allows surfers to adjust the volume of the surfboard to suit their riding style and preferences. This could be achieved through a adjustable foam core or a modular design."
