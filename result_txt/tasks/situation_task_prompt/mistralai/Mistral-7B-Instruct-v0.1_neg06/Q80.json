    "Invent a new form of currency: In a world without paper money or coins, it would be necessary to create a new form of currency. This could be anything from bartering to a digital currency. The new currency could be based on a commodity that is universally valued, such as gold or oil.",
    "Use a bartering system: In the absence of paper money and coins, people would need to rely on a bartering system. This would involve trading goods or services directly with others in order to acquire the things they need. For example, a farmer could trade his produce for a doctor's services.",
    "Use a digital currency: With the advent of technology, digital currencies like Bitcoin have become increasingly popular. In a world without paper money or coins, digital currencies could be used to pay for goods and services.",
    "Use a mobile payment system: With the rise of mobile technology, people can now make payments using their phones. In a world without paper money or coins, mobile payment systems could be used to pay for goods and services.",
    "Use a gift card system: Gift cards could be used as a form of payment in a world without paper money or coins. People could purchase gift cards from retailers and use them to pay for goods and services. This would eliminate the need for cash or credit cards."
