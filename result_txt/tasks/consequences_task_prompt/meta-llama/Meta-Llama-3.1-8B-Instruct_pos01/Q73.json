    "**Ecosystem Collapse**: With the loss of apex predators, herbivores, and other keystone species, entire ecosystems would collapse. This would lead to a catastrophic loss of biodiversity, affecting not only the environment but also human societies that depend on these ecosystems for resources, food, and livelihoods. Confidence score: 0.9",
    "**Pollution and Toxin Buildup**: Without animals to regulate and maintain ecological balances, pollutants and toxins would accumulate in the environment, posing significant threats to human health and the planet's ecosystems. For example, the loss of vultures would allow carcasses to rot, releasing toxins into the environment. Confidence score: 0.8",
    "**Climate Change Acceleration**: Animals play a crucial role in maintaining the planet's carbon cycle. Without them, the absorption and storage of carbon dioxide would be severely impacted, leading to accelerated climate change. This would have devastating consequences for human societies and the environment. Confidence score: 0.85",
    "**Loss of Medicinal Discoveries**: Many medicines are derived from animals, such as venom from snakes and spiders, or compounds found in certain plants that are only accessible through animal pollination. The loss of these species would mean the loss of potential life-saving treatments. Confidence score: 0.9",
    "**Psychological and Cultural Impact**: The extinction of animals would have a profound impact on human psychology and culture. The loss of iconic species like elephants, lions, and whales would be a blow to our collective identity and sense of wonder. It would also lead to a decline in eco-tourism, affecting local economies and communities that depend on wildlife tourism. Confidence score: 0.8"
