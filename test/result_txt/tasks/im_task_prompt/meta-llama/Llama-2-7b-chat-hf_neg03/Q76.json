    "Hair Tie with Built-in Hair Serum: Create a hair tie that not only keeps your hair out of your face but also provides a dose of hair serum with every use. The hair tie could have a small reservoir for the serum, and when you tie your hair back, the serum is massaged into your hair. This would not only add moisture and shine to your hair but also help to detangle and protect it from damage.",
    "Hair Tie with Customizable Colors and Styles: Design a hair tie that allows you to change the color and style of the tie to match your mood or occasion. The tie could have interchangeable sections in different colors and patterns, allowing you to create a unique look every time. This would be a fun and creative way to express yourself through fashion.",
    "Hair Tie with Built-in Heat or Cold Therapy: Create a hair tie that provides heat or cold therapy to your scalp. The tie could have a small heating or cooling element embedded in the band, which could be turned on or off as needed. This would be perfect for people who suffer from scalp irritation or tension headaches.",
    "Hair Tie with Magnetic Closure: Design a hair tie that uses magnetic closure instead of traditional knots. The tie could have two magnetic pieces that snap together, creating a secure and comfortable fit. This would be perfect for people who have difficulty tying their hair or who want a quick and easy way to keep their hair out of their face.",
    "Hair Tie with Built-in Hair Growth Serum: Create a hair tie that contains a small amount of hair growth serum.
