    "**Integrated Augmented Reality Dashboard**:    - Transform the traditional dashboard into an augmented reality (AR) display that projects critical information onto the windshield. This could include navigation prompts, speed, fuel levels, and hazard alerts, all seamlessly integrated into the driver's line of sight. Additionally, AR could highlight points of interest or provide real-time information about the surrounding environment, improving safety and navigation.",
    "**Modular Vehicle Design**:    - Create a modular car design that allows owners to easily swap out parts or upgrade components as needed. For instance, users could replace the battery for a more powerful one, switch out the entertainment system for the latest tech, or even alter the body style for different aesthetics. This would promote sustainability by extending the vehicle's lifespan and reducing waste, as well as allowing for personalized customization.",
    "**Smart Energy Management System**:    - Develop a smart energy management system that optimizes fuel or battery usage based on driving habits, traffic patterns, and even weather conditions. The system could provide real-time feedback to drivers on how to improve their efficiency, suggest alternative routes to save fuel, and even collaborate with smart city infrastructure to manage energy consumption dynamically.",
    "**Biometric Security Features**:    - Implement advanced biometric security systems that use facial recognition or fingerprint scanning to unlock and start the car. This would eliminate the need for keys or fobs, enhancing convenience and security. Additionally, the system could remember individual driver profiles, adjusting settings such as seat position, climate control, and infotainment preferences automatically upon entry.",
    "**In-Car Health Monitoring**:    - Equip cars with health monitoring technology that tracks the driver's vital signs, such as heart rate and stress levels, using wearable devices or built-in sensors. If the system detects signs of fatigue or distress, it could suggest taking a break, play calming music, or even activate self-driving features to navigate to a safe stopping point. This could greatly enhance road safety and driver well-being."
