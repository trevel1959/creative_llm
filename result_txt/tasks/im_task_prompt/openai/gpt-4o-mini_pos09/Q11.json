    "**Smart Hydration Reminder**: Design a water bottle with a built-in smart sensor that tracks the userâ€™s hydration levels. The bottle would sync with a mobile app to remind users to drink water based on their activity level, weather conditions, and personal hydration goals. The app could also provide tips on staying hydrated and offer rewards for meeting daily water intake targets.",
    "**Flavor Infuser Chamber**: Create a dual-chamber water bottle that allows users to infuse their water with natural flavors. One chamber could hold fresh fruits, herbs, or tea bags, while the other holds plain water. A twist mechanism would allow the user to control the infusion strength, enabling them to enjoy a variety of flavors without added sugars or artificial ingredients.",
    "**Modular Design**: Introduce a modular water bottle system where users can customize their bottle based on their needs. Different modules could include an insulated section for hot beverages, a built-in filter for tap water, or even a compartment for snacks. This versatility would cater to various lifestyles, whether for gym-goers, hikers, or office workers.",
    "**Eco-Friendly Materials**: Develop a water bottle made from biodegradable or recycled materials that can break down safely in the environment. Additionally, implement a refillable system where users can return their used bottles for a discount on future purchases, promoting a circular economy and reducing plastic waste.",
    "**Temperature Control Technology**: Integrate advanced thermal insulation technology that not only keeps drinks cold or hot for an extended period but also allows users to adjust the temperature through a smartphone app. This feature would be ideal for those who prefer their drinks at specific temperatures, enhancing the overall drinking experience."
