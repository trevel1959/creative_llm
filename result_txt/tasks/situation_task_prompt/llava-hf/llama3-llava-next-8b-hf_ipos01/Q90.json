    "Atmospheric Water Generation: Create a device that captures and condenses the water vapor in the air, using a specialized membrane or nanotechnology to extract the water from the air and store it in a container for later use.",
    "Fog Collection: Design a mesh or grid-like structure that can be placed outdoors to collect fog or dew, which can then be collected and condensed into water for drinking or other purposes.",
    "Rainwater Harvesting System: Develop a system that collects rainwater from rooftops and other surfaces, using a network of gutters and pipes to direct the water to a central storage area for later use.",
    "Ice Harvesting: Utilize a network of sensors and automated equipment to collect ice from cold environments such as mountains or polar regions, and then melt it to create a source of freshwater for various uses.",
    "Ocean Thermal Energy Conversion: Harness the temperature difference between warm surface waters and cold deep waters to generate electricity, which can then be used to power water desalination plants and provide clean drinking water."
