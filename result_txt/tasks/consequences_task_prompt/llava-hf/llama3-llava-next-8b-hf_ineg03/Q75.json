    "Ecosystem collapse: The sudden change in the ocean's composition would disrupt the delicate balance of marine ecosystems. This would lead to a massive loss of biodiversity, as many species that rely on the saltwater environment would be unable to survive in the new freshwater conditions.",
    "Geological upheaval: The increase in water volume would put immense pressure on the Earth's crust, causing massive geological upheaval. This could lead to the formation of new landmasses and the destruction of existing ones, altering the global geography.",
    "Altered global climate: The sudden increase in freshwater would alter the global climate, as the water vapor in the atmosphere would be rapidly converted into liquid water. This would lead to a dramatic cooling of the planet, causing extreme weather events and a rapid shift in global weather patterns.",
    "Disruption of global food supply: The sudden change in the ocean's composition would disrupt the global food supply, as many fish and other marine organisms would be unable to survive in the new freshwater conditions. This would lead to a global food shortage, causing widespread poverty and starvation.",
    "Impact on global economy: The sudden and catastrophic flood would have a devastating impact on the global economy, as businesses and industries that rely on coastal regions would be severely disrupted. This would lead to widespread job losses and a global economic crisis."
