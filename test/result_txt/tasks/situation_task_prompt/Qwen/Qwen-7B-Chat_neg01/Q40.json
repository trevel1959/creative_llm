    "Utilize human energy: One idea could be to harness the power of human movement to power electronic devices. This could involve attaching small generators to shoes or clothing that convert kinetic energy from walking or running into electrical energy. While this may not be practical for long periods of time, it could provide a temporary solution for people in emergency situations.",
    "Solar-powered devices: Another option could be to develop solar-powered devices that can charge electronic devices when exposed to sunlight. These devices could be portable and easy to use, providing a sustainable source of energy for people who are away from power outlets.",
    "Wind-powered devices: Similar to solar-powered devices, wind-powered devices could be developed that can generate electricity from wind. These devices could be used in areas with consistent wind patterns, such as coastal regions or mountainous areas.",
    "Human-powered generators: A third idea could be to create human-powered generators that can produce electricity from body movements. These devices could be worn on the body and could be used to charge electronic devices or provide power for other appliances.",
    "Hydroelectric power: Finally, hydroelectric power could be utilized to power electronic devices. This involves using water to turn turbines, which then generate electricity. While this method requires access to a reliable source of water, it could be a viable option for people living near rivers or other bodies of water."
