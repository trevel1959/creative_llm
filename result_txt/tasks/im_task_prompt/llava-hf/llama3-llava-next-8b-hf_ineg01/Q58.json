    "Built-in Diffuser Attachment: Incorporate a built-in diffuser attachment that allows users to add essential oils to the air, providing a healthier and more relaxing hair drying experience. This would be particularly beneficial for those who suffer from allergies or want to add a pleasant aroma to their daily routine.",

    "Air Control System: Implement an air control system that allows users to adjust the airflow and speed of the hair dryer. This would provide more precise control over the styling process and reduce the risk of damaging delicate hair.",
    "Energy Efficiency Mode: Create an energy efficiency mode that helps reduce energy consumption by adjusting the heat output based on the ambient temperature. This would not only be environmentally friendly but also save users money on their energy bills.",
    "Multi-Functionality: Add a multi-functionality feature that allows the hair dryer to be used for tasks beyond just hair drying, such as drying small household items or providing a source of warm air for tasks like cleaning or drying.
