    "Introducing a new, integrated ticketing system that allows passengers to pay for their rides on any mode of public transportation with a single, rechargeable card. This would make it easier for commuters to travel and reduce the number of lost or forgotten fares.",
    "Implementing a demand-responsive pricing model for public transportation, where fares are dynamically adjusted based on the number of passengers and the time of day. This would encourage more people to use public transportation during peak hours and reduce congestion on the roads.",
    "Establishing a network of electric buses and trams powered by renewable energy sources, such as solar panels or wind turbines. This would reduce the carbon footprint of the public transportation system and make it more sustainable for the environment.",
    "Creating a new, dedicated lane for public transportation vehicles on the city's main roads. This would reduce the travel time for buses and trams and improve the overall efficiency of the public transportation system.",
    "Implementing a smart, real-time tracking system for public transportation vehicles, which would allow passengers to see the location of their bus or tram in real-time on their smartphones. This would improve the reliability and transparency of the public transportation system and reduce frustration for commuters."
