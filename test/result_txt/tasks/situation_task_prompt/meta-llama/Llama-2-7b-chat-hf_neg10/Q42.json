    "Create a Signal Fire: A signal fire is a classic method of communication that can be used to alert passing boats or planes of your presence on the island. Gather dry wood and other flammable materials and build a fire on a hill or cliffside. This will create a large smoke signal that can be seen from a distance.",
    "Find Fresh Water: Fresh water is essential for survival, so it's important to find a source of water that is safe to drink. Look for streams, rivers, or ponds that are located away from the coastline and are less likely to be contaminated by saltwater. You can also collect dew or rainwater by placing a container under a tree or in a sheltered area.",
    "Build a Shelter: A shelter can provide protection from the elements and help you to stay warm and dry. Use natural materials like leaves, branches, and vines to build a lean-to or a debris hut. You can also use rocks or coral to create a windbreak or a wall for your shelter.",
    "Create a Fishing Net: Fishing can provide a reliable source of food, so it's important to create a net that can be used to catch fish in the ocean. Use vines, nylon cord, or other strong materials to create a net that can be used to catch fish. You can also use a spear or a harpoon to catch fish.",
    "Make a Sign: If you want to signal for help, you can create a sign that can be seen from a distance. Use rocks, sticks, or other materials to create an \"SOS\" signal or a message that can be easily read by passing boats or planes. You can also use a mirror to reflect sunlight and create a signal that can be seen from a distance."
