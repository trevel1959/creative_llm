    "**Adjustable Nozzle for Different Plant Types**: Design a watering can with an adjustable nozzle that allows users to switch between different spray patterns, such as a gentle mist for delicate seedlings or a strong stream for larger plants. This feature would cater to the needs of various plants and ensure that each one receives the appropriate amount of water without damage.",
    "**Built-in Fertilizer Dispenser**: Create a watering can that includes a compartment for liquid fertilizer, allowing users to mix water and nutrients in one go. The can would have a dual spout system—one for plain water and another for the fertilized solution—enabling users to nourish their plants effectively while watering.",
    "**Ergonomic Design with a Grip Handle**: Revamp the traditional watering can design to include an ergonomic handle that conforms to the user's grip, reducing strain on the wrist and hand. The can could be made from lightweight materials and feature a counterbalanced design to make lifting and pouring easier, especially for those with limited strength.",
    "**Water Level Indicator with a Color-Coded System**: Implement a transparent water level indicator on the side of the watering can that uses a color-coded system. For instance, blue could indicate full, green for half-full, and red for empty. This visual cue would help users quickly assess how much water is left without needing to lift the can.",
    "**Collapsible Design for Easy Storage**: Introduce a collapsible watering can that can be easily folded down when not in use. This design would be particularly beneficial for those with limited storage space or for gardeners who travel frequently. Made from durable, flexible materials, the can would expand when needed and collapse for convenient storage."
