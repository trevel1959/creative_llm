    "Hydrofoils: One possible solution to travel across a large body of water without ships or boats is through the use of hydrofoils. Hydrofoils are boats that use a wing-like structure, called a hydrofoil, to lift the hull of the boat out of the water. As the boat moves forward, the hydrofoil creates lift, reducing the drag on the hull and allowing the boat to travel faster and more efficiently. This technology could be used to create high-speed ferries or cargo ships that could travel across large bodies of water without the need for traditional boats or ships.",
    "Air-cushion vehicles: Another option for traveling across large bodies of water is through the use of air-cushion vehicles, also known as hovercraft. These vehicles use a cushion of air to lift the hull of the vehicle off the water, reducing drag and allowing the vehicle to travel at high speeds. This technology could be used to create high-speed ferries or cargo ships that could travel across large bodies of water without the need for traditional boats or ships.",
    "Submarines: Submarines are another option for traveling across large bodies of water without the need for traditional ships or boats. Submarines use a combination of ballast tanks and propellers to move through the water, allowing them to travel long distances without surfacing. This technology could be used to create cargo ships or passenger ferries that could travel across large bodies of water without the need for traditional boats or ships.",
    "Water-based jetpacks: Another creative solution for traveling across large bodies of water is through the use of water-based jetpacks. These jetpacks use a combination of water and jet propulsion to lift the user off the water and allow them to travel at high speeds. This technology could be used for recreational purposes, such as water sports, or for more practical applications, such as search and rescue missions.",
    "Aquatic gliders: Finally, another option for traveling across large bodies of water is through the use of aquatic gliders. These gliders use a combination of buoyancy and wing-like structures to move through the water, allowing them to travel long distances without the need for traditional propulsion. This technology could be used to create high-speed ferries or cargo ships that could travel across large bodies of water without the need for traditional boats or"
