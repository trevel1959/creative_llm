    "Hydrofoils: Hydrofoils are boats that use wings or foils to lift the hull of the boat out of the water, reducing drag and increasing speed. With all ships and boats gone, hydrofoils could be used as a means of transportation across large bodies of water. They could be powered by electric or solar energy to reduce their carbon footprint.",
    "Seabed Tunnels: With the disappearance of ships and boats, a new form of transportation could be developed: seabed tunnels. These tunnels could be built using advanced technology and materials to withstand the pressure of the water and provide a safe passage for travelers. They could be powered by electricity or even solar energy, making them a sustainable option.",
    "Air-Buoyant Cars: Imagine cars that can float on water! Air-buoyant cars could be designed to stay afloat without any additional propulsion system. These cars could be powered by electric motors, making them a zero-emission mode of transportation. They could be used for both short and long-distance travel, providing a unique and eco-friendly way to traverse large bodies of water.",
    "Water-Borne Bicycles: Imagine cycling across the water! Water-borne bicycles could be designed to float on the surface of the water, allowing riders to pedal their way across large bodies of water. These bicycles could be powered by human energy or electric motors, making them a sustainable and eco-friendly mode of transportation.",
    "Aqua-Sleds: Aqua-sleds are small, inflatable vessels that could be used to travel across large bodies of water. They could be powered by a combination of human energy and electric motors, making them a sustainable and eco-friendly mode of transportation. They could also be designed for single or multiple passengers, depending on the needs of the traveler."
