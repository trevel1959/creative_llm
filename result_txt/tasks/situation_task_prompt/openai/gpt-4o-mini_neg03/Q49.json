    "**Homemade Fire Retardant Spray**: Create a natural fire retardant spray using common household ingredients. A mixture of baking soda, vinegar, and water can be applied to flammable surfaces. While it won't stop a large fire, it can help slow down the spread of flames on surfaces like wooden decks or fences. Regularly apply this solution, especially during dry seasons, to enhance your home's fire resistance.",
    "**Smart Fire Detection System**: Design a DIY smart fire detection system using low-cost sensors and microcontrollers like Arduino or Raspberry Pi. Set up smoke detectors and temperature sensors throughout your home that can send alerts to your smartphone or a central hub when they detect unusual heat or smoke. This early warning system can help you evacuate or take action before a fire escalates.",
    "**Reflective Barrier Installation**: Create reflective barriers around your home using materials like aluminum foil or Mylar. These barriers can be placed on windows and around the perimeter of the house to reflect heat away during a fire. The reflective surface can help reduce the temperature around your home, minimizing the risk of ignition from radiant heat.",
    "**DIY Fire Breaks**: Build DIY fire breaks by digging shallow trenches filled with gravel or sand around your property. These breaks can help slow down the progress of a fire by creating a barrier that is difficult for flames to cross. Regularly maintain these breaks by clearing any vegetation that may grow into them, ensuring they remain effective.",
    "**Emergency Water Supply**: Establish an emergency water supply system by collecting rainwater in large barrels or tanks. Use this water for both irrigation and as a backup source in case of a fire. Equip your water supply with a manual pump or a simple siphoning system to allow you to access water quickly. This can be particularly useful for dousing small fires or wetting down areas around your home."
