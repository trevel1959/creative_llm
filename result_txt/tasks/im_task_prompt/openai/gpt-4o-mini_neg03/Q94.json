    "**Scented Candle with Refillable Pods**: Instead of traditional candles that are discarded once burned out, this innovative design would feature a reusable base and interchangeable scented pods. Users could purchase various scents in pod form, allowing them to easily switch fragrances without the waste of an entire candle. The base could also have a small indicator to show when a pod is running low.",
    "**Candle with Embedded Essential Oils**: This concept involves creating a candle that has pockets of essential oils embedded within the wax. As the candle burns, these pockets melt and release their aromatic properties, enhancing the overall scent experience. This would provide a layered fragrance that evolves throughout the burn time, creating a unique olfactory journey.",
    "**Eco-Friendly Candle with Seed Paper Labels**: To promote sustainability, this candle could feature a label made of seed paper that users can plant after the candle is used. The label could contain wildflower seeds or herbs, allowing users to grow their own plants as a reminder of the candle's fragrance. This would not only reduce waste but also encourage a connection with nature.",
    "**Candle with Built-in Sound System**: This multi-sensory candle would incorporate a Bluetooth speaker within its design, allowing users to play music or nature sounds while enjoying the ambiance of the candlelight. The speaker could be discreetly hidden within the candle holder, creating a harmonious atmosphere for relaxation or social gatherings.",
    "**Interactive Candle with Aroma Diffusion**: This innovative candle would feature a built-in aroma diffusion system that releases scents in intervals, creating a dynamic aromatic experience. Users could choose from different diffusion patterns (steady, pulsing, or wave-like) and customize the intensity of the fragrance, making it perfect for parties, meditation, or cozy evenings at home."
