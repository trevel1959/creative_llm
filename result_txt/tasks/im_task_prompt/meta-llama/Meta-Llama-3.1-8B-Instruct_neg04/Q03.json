    "**Microwave-Powered Mini-Garden**: A compact, self-sustaining garden that uses a microwave oven's heat to germinate seeds and nurture young plants. The microwave's energy is harnessed through a specially designed reflector, which focuses the microwaves onto a small area. This creates a controlled environment for seedlings to grow, allowing for precise temperature control and optimal growth conditions. The mini-garden is enclosed in a clear plastic container, providing a unique and fascinating view of the germination process. Users can monitor the progress of their seeds and plants through a built-in camera and mobile app, receiving real-time updates on temperature, humidity, and growth stages.",
