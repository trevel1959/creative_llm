    "**Security Threats**: An international peace summit could attract protests or even threats from extremist groups opposed to the peace talks. Ensuring the safety of delegates and attendees is paramount. This requires comprehensive security planning, including risk assessments, collaboration with local law enforcement, and the implementation of security protocols such as screening at entrances and the presence of security personnel throughout the venue.",
    "**Logistical Challenges**: Coordinating travel, accommodation, and transportation for delegates from various countries can be complex. Potential issues include flight cancellations, visa delays, and accommodation shortages. Organizers should create a detailed logistical plan that includes contingency measures for travel disruptions, partnerships with local hotels for guaranteed room blocks, and a transportation service to facilitate movement between venues.",
    "**Diverse Agenda Priorities**: Each participating country may have different priorities and agendas, which can lead to conflicts during discussions. To address this, organizers should conduct pre-summit consultations with representatives from each country to gather input on their key issues. This information can be used to create a balanced agenda that allows for the inclusion of all voices, and setting aside time for open dialogue can help build consensus.",
    "**Technological Barriers**: Reliance on technology for presentations, virtual participation, and communication can lead to problems such as connectivity issues or technical malfunctions. To avoid these issues, organizers should conduct thorough testing of all technology prior to the event, have IT support on standby, and provide backup systems for presentations (like printed materials) in case of technical failures.",
    "**Funding and Sponsorship Issues**: Securing adequate funding and sponsorship for the summit can be challenging, especially if potential sponsors have conflicting interests. To ensure financial stability, organizers should create a diverse funding strategy that includes public and private sources, as well as crowdfunding campaigns. Transparency in sponsorships can also help avoid conflicts of interest that may arise during discussions."
