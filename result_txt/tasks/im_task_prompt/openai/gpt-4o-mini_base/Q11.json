    "**Smart Hydration Tracking**: Incorporate a smart sensor within the bottle that tracks water intake and syncs with a mobile app. The app could provide reminders to drink water based on the user's activity level, climate, and health goals. It could also analyze hydration patterns over time, offering personalized suggestions for optimal hydration and alerting users if they’re falling behind on their daily water intake.",
    "**Modular Design**: Create a modular water bottle that allows users to customize it with various attachments, such as a fruit infuser for flavored water, a filter for purifying water from natural sources, or a compartment for storing snacks. This versatility would cater to different lifestyles and preferences, making it a multi-functional tool for health-conscious individuals.",
    "**Temperature Regulation**: Develop a double-walled vacuum-insulated bottle that not only keeps drinks cold or hot for extended periods but also features a built-in temperature display on the exterior. This display would show the current temperature of the liquid inside, allowing users to enjoy their drinks at the perfect temperature without having to open the bottle.",
    "**Eco-Friendly Materials**: Use innovative biodegradable materials or recycled plastics to construct the water bottle. Additionally, introduce a program where users can return their old bottles to be recycled or repurposed into new products, creating a closed-loop system. This initiative would appeal to environmentally conscious consumers and reduce plastic waste.",
    "**Built-in Filter and Purification System**: Equip the water bottle with a built-in filtration system that can purify tap or natural water sources. This could involve a multi-stage filter that removes contaminants and improves taste, making it suitable for travel or outdoor activities. The filter would be easily replaceable, and the bottle could have an indicator to notify users when it’s time for a replacement."
