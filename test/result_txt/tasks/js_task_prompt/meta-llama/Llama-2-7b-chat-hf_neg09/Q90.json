    "Improved Respiratory System: One significant change I would make is to enhance the respiratory system. I would redesign the lungs to be more efficient and adaptable to various environments. The lungs would be able to expand and contract more easily, allowing for more efficient oxygen absorption and carbon dioxide removal. Additionally, I would add an extra set of lungs to increase the overall oxygen intake. This would enable humans to survive in low-oxygen environments, such as high-altitude regions or underwater.",
    "Enhanced Sensory Perception: To improve sensory perception, I would redesign the human sensory system to be more sensitive and diverse. I would add more sensitive eyes to detect a wider range of light frequencies, including ultraviolet and infrared. I would also increase the number of taste buds to enhance the ability to taste a broader range of flavors. Furthermore, I would add more sensitive hearing organs to detect a wider range of sound frequencies, including infrasound and ultrasound. This would allow humans to perceive their surroundings more accurately and detect potential threats more easily.",
    "Enhanced Energy Production: To increase energy production, I would redesign the human metabolism to be more efficient and sustainable. I would enhance the mitochondria to produce more energy from food, and I would add more efficient energy-producing organs, such as solar panels or fuel cells. This would allow humans to maintain their energy levels more consistently and reduce their reliance on external energy sources. Additionally, I would redesign the digestive system to be more efficient at extracting nutrients from food, reducing waste and energy consumption.",
    "Improved Healing and Regeneration: To improve healing and regeneration, I would redesign the human body's healing mechanisms to be faster and more efficient. I would enhance the immune system to be more effective at fighting off infections and diseases, and I would add regenerative organs that could repair damaged tissues and organs more quickly. Additionally, I would redesign the nervous system to be more resilient and adaptable, allowing for faster recovery from injuries and diseases.",
