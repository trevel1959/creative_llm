This would be achieved through a blockchain-based voting system, which would be secure, transparent, and tamper-proof.",

    "**Environmental Stewardship**: This government would prioritize environmental sustainability and conservation. It would implement policies that promote eco-friendly practices, such as investing in renewable energy, reducing waste, and increasing the use of sustainable materials.
