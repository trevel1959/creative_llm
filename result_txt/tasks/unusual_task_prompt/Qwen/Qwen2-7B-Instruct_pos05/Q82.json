    "**Innovative Ironing Board Design**: Create an ironing board that not only folds up for easy storage but also doubles as a hanger for clothes while they're being ironed. This design would be particularly useful for those living in small spaces or who frequently need to move their ironing station around.",
    "**Smart Clothing Steam System**: Develop an iron that incorporates a small steam generator, allowing it to remove wrinkles without excessive heat. This could be especially beneficial for fabrics that are prone to burning under high temperatures, such as silk or wool. The steam function can be controlled through a smartphone app, offering users precise control over the amount of steam used.",
    "**Portable Ironing Station for Travel**: Design a compact, lightweight ironing station that includes an adjustable heating plate and a retractable cord. This station would come with a carrying case, making it ideal for frequent travelers who need to maintain their wardrobe's appearance while on the go.",
    "**Automated Ironing System for Busy Lives**: Create an automated ironing system that uses sensors and artificial intelligence to identify different fabrics and adjust its settings accordingly. The system would be compatible with smart home technology, allowing users to schedule ironing tasks from their phones or voice commands through virtual assistants like Amazon Alexa or Google Home.",
    "**Sustainable Ironing Solution**: Develop an eco-friendly ironing solution that uses renewable energy sources, such as solar panels or wind turbines, to power the iron. This system would not only reduce the environmental impact of ironing but also encourage users to adopt more sustainable practices in their daily lives. The iron could be designed to recharge itself using this renewable energy, further reducing its carbon footprint."
