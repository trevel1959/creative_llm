    "Use technology to compensate: Utilize wearable technology, such as smart gloves or a smart exoskeleton, that can detect and alert the user to potential hazards. These devices could be programmed to recognize certain patterns or objects, and the user could receive visual or auditory cues to avoid injury.",
    "Learn to read the environment: A person could learn to interpret subtle cues in their surroundings to avoid injury. This might involve paying close attention to the movement of objects, the behavior of others, or changes in the environment.",
    "Develop a heightened sense of hearing: By focusing on their sense of hearing, a person could detect sounds that indicate potential hazards, such as breaking glass or the sound of a falling object.",
    "Train in sensory deprivation: A person could undergo sensory deprivation training to increase their reliance on their remaining senses. This might involve spending time in a dark, quiet room with limited input, forcing the person to rely on their remaining senses to navigate and avoid injury.",
    "Use tactile maps: Create tactile maps of the environment, similar to those used by visually impaired individuals. These maps would be designed to help a person with a lack of physical sensation navigate and avoid hazards."
