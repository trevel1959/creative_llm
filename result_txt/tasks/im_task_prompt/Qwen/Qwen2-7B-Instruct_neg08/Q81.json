    "**Auto-Adjusting Spatula**: Create a spatula that adjusts its angle based on the surface it's being used on. This feature would be particularly useful when dealing with curved surfaces like woks or when flipping pancakes. The auto-adjusting mechanism would prevent food from sticking and reduce the need for constant manual adjustments.",
    "**Spatula with Built-in Blender**: Combine the functions of a spatula and a mini blender into one tool. This would allow for easy mixing and blending of ingredients directly in the pan or pot without having to transfer them to another container. It would save time and effort, especially during meal preparation.",
    "**Heat-Resistant, Flexible Spatula**: Design a spatula made from flexible materials that can withstand high temperatures without breaking or melting. This would enable the spatula to be used safely in frying pans and ovens without worrying about damage. The flexibility would also help in easily reaching tight corners and edges.",
    "**Spatula with Embedded Light**: Integrate LED lights into the spatula handle, which can be activated when needed. This feature would be especially helpful in low-light environments, such as when cooking at night or in a dimly lit kitchen. It would also serve as an indicator, showing the user when the spatula is in use or when it needs to be recharged.",
    "**Ergonomic and Adjustable Grip Spatula**: Develop a spatula with a grip that can be adjusted to different sizes and shapes to suit various hand sizes and preferences. This ergonomic design would reduce fatigue and strain, making cooking easier and more comfortable. Additionally, the grip could have built-in features like non-slip pads or magnetic attachments for added convenience."
