    "**Natural Pest Control**: Cacti naturally repel pests due to their spines and chemicals like terpenes and alkaloids. Farmers and gardeners can use this natural deterrent to protect crops and plants from insects and rodents without resorting to synthetic pesticides.",
    "**Building Material**: The inner core of a cactus, known as the \"juice\" or \"water\" part, could be utilized as a sustainable building material. By removing the outer layer and processing the inner core, it can be used to construct lightweight, yet strong, walls and structures, particularly for areas prone to earthquakes or in disaster relief situations.",
    "**Artistic Sculptures and Decorations**: The intricate shapes and unique textures of cacti make them ideal for sculptural art pieces or decorative elements. Artists can create large-scale installations, smaller sculptures, or even integrate cactus parts into everyday household items like vases or wall hangings.",
    "**Medical Research and Therapy**: Certain cacti contain bioactive compounds that have potential medicinal properties. Researchers could study these compounds for their therapeutic effects, such as pain relief, anti-inflammatory, or antimicrobial properties. Additionally, the calming effect of cacti might be used in therapeutic settings, such as in hospitals or mental health facilities.",
    "**Sustainable Textiles**: Cactus fibers can be processed into yarn and used to create durable, moisture-wicking, and breathable clothing. This sustainable textile option would appeal to environmentally conscious consumers seeking eco-friendly fashion alternatives."
