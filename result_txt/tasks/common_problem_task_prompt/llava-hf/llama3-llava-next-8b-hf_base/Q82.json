    "Building codes and regulations: Depending on the location of the tiny house, there may be building codes and regulations that must be followed. The designer must ensure that the house meets these requirements while still maintaining its functionality and style.",
    "Energy efficiency: A tiny house is smaller and more exposed to the elements than a traditional house, which means that it may be more susceptible to energy loss. The designer must take steps to ensure that the house is energy-efficient, such as using insulation, energy-efficient windows, and solar panels.",
    "Accessibility: A tiny house may not be suitable for everyone, especially for individuals with mobility issues. The designer must consider the needs of the occupants and design the space to be accessible and easy to navigate.",
    "Zoning laws: Zoning laws may restrict the placement of tiny houses in certain areas, such as residential zones. The designer must research and comply with these laws to ensure that the house is legally built and can be occupied.",
    "Water and sewage: Tiny houses often have limited access to traditional water and sewage systems, which can make it difficult to meet the needs of the occupants. The designer must find alternative solutions, such as rainwater harvesting or composting toilets."
