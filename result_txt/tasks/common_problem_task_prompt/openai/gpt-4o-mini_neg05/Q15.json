    "**Pest Infestation**: Gardens can attract various pests such as aphids, slugs, and beetles, which can damage or destroy plants. Implementing an integrated pest management (IPM) approach, which includes using natural predators, introducing companion planting, and applying organic pesticides as a last resort, can help manage pest populations while minimizing harm to the ecosystem.",
    "**Watering Challenges**: Overwatering or underwatering can lead to plant stress and diseases like root rot. To mitigate this, consider installing a drip irrigation system or using self-watering pots that provide consistent moisture levels. Additionally, monitoring weather conditions and adjusting watering schedules accordingly can help ensure plants receive the right amount of water.",
    "**Invasive Plant Species**: Some plants can be invasive and may outcompete native species, disrupting the local ecosystem. Before planting, research the species you intend to include in your garden to ensure they are non-invasive. If invasive plants are already present, develop a plan for their removal or control to protect the garden's biodiversity.",
    "**Sunlight Availability**: Different plants require varying amounts of sunlight, and inadequate light can stunt growth. Assess your garden's sunlight exposure throughout the day to determine the best placement for each plant. If necessary, consider pruning nearby trees or shrubs that may be blocking sunlight or choose shade-tolerant plants for less sunny areas.",
    "**Seasonal Planting Timing**: Timing is crucial for planting to ensure that crops mature before the onset of frost or extreme heat. To avoid this issue, research the growing seasons for your chosen plants and create a planting calendar. Starting seeds indoors or using cold frames can also extend the growing season and protect young plants from unexpected weather changes."
