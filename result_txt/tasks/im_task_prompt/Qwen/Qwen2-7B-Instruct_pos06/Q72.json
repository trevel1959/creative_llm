    "**Solar-Powered Surfboard**: Designing a surfboard that integrates solar panels into its structure, allowing it to charge itself while being exposed to sunlight. The energy harvested could power onboard devices like GPS, communication systems, or even a small fan for cooling on hot days. This innovative idea aims to reduce dependency on external power sources and promote sustainable surfing. **Confidence Score:** 0.95",
    "**Customizable Surfboard Design Studio**: Create an online platform where surfers can design their own surfboards. Users can choose from various shapes, materials, colors, and add-ons such as built-in fins or graphics. This platform would allow for customization based on personal style, skill level, and performance preferences. **Confidence Score:** 0.93",
    "**Smart Surfboard with AI Feedback System**: Integrate artificial intelligence into surfboards to provide real-time feedback to surfers. The board could analyze factors like wave conditions, rider position, and performance data to suggest improvements or adjustments. This technology could significantly enhance learning and performance for both beginners and professionals. **Confidence Score:** 0.98",
    "**Biodegradable Surfboard Material**: Develop surfboards made from sustainable materials that are biodegradable and eco-friendly. Materials like bamboo, recycled plastics, or plant-based composites could replace traditional fiberglass or foam boards. This not only reduces environmental impact but also opens up new markets in the eco-conscious community. **Confidence Score:** 0.96",
    "**In-Water Charging Station**: Design floating platforms that act as charging stations for surfboards. These platforms could be submerged under the water's surface, providing a convenient way for surfers to charge their boards during breaks between waves. They could also include amenities like lockers, showers, and refreshments, creating a community hub for surfers. **Confidence Score:** 0.97"
