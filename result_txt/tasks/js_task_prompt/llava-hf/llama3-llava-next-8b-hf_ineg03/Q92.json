    "**Gravitational Tunnels**: Instead of moving around the sun on a circular path, planets could travel through gravitational tunnels. These tunnels would be created by the sun's intense gravitational pull, allowing planets to move from one side of the solar system to the other without having to follow a predetermined orbit.",
    "**Stellar Bridges**: In this design, planets would be connected by a network of bridges that span the vast distances between them. These bridges would be made of a lightweight, durable material and would allow for instant travel between planets. This would make the solar system more accessible and allow for a more interconnected existence.",
    "**Planetary Oceans**: The solar system could be redesigned to feature vast, interconnected oceans that cover the surfaces of the planets. These oceans would provide a consistent source of water and could support life across the solar system. Additionally, the gravitational pull of the oceans would create a more stable, predictable environment for the planets.",
    "**Solar Lenses**: Planets could be designed with lenses that focus the sun's light, creating a more uniform and predictable climate across the solar system. This would allow for a more consistent and controlled environment for life to flourish.",
    "**Gravitational Wells**: Instead of having planets orbiting the sun, the solar system could be designed with gravitational wells that draw objects in. These wells would be created by the sun's intense gravitational pull, and objects would fall into them and be pulled towards the center of the solar system."
