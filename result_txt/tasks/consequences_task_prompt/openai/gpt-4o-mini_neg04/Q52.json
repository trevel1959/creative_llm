    "**Gravitational Effects**: The Earth’s rotation causes a slight bulging at the equator due to centrifugal force. If the Earth stopped spinning, this bulge would disappear, leading to a redistribution of water and land. Oceans would flow toward the poles, causing massive flooding in some areas and exposing land in others. Coastal cities would face severe inundation, while previously submerged regions could become new landmasses, drastically altering geography and ecosystems.",
    "**Altered Day/Night Cycle**: The current 24-hour day-night cycle would be replaced by a much longer cycle. One side of the Earth would experience a continuous day lasting for six months, followed by a six-month night. This would have profound effects on all life forms, disrupting circadian rhythms, photosynthesis in plants, and animal behavior. Many species would struggle to adapt to the extended periods of light or darkness, leading to mass extinctions and a significant shift in biodiversity.",
    "**Collapse of Infrastructure**: The sudden halt of the Earth’s rotation would create a catastrophic scenario for human infrastructure. Buildings, bridges, and roads designed with the planet’s rotation in mind would be at risk of structural failure. The inertia of moving objects would cause devastation, with everything not anchored down potentially flying eastward at high speeds. This would lead to widespread destruction, making recovery and rebuilding efforts incredibly challenging.",
    "**Changes in Timekeeping and Navigation**: The cessation of rotation would fundamentally alter our systems of timekeeping and navigation. Time zones would become irrelevant, as the concept of local solar time would no longer exist. Navigation systems reliant on the rotation of the Earth, such as GPS, would require a complete overhaul. New methods of determining location and time would need to be developed, potentially leading to confusion and chaos in daily life.",
    "**Psychological Impact on Humanity**: The psychological effects of living on a non-rotating Earth could be profound. The constant exposure to extreme conditions—either perpetual daylight or darkness—could lead to mental health issues such as depression, anxiety, and disorientation. The loss of familiar cycles and rhythms could disrupt human societies, leading to increased stress and societal breakdown as communities struggle to adapt to their new reality."
