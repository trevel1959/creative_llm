    "Virtual Reality Steering Wheel: Create a steering wheel that utilizes virtual reality technology to provide a more immersive and interactive driving experience. The wheel could be equipped with sensors that track the driver's hand movements, allowing them to steer the vehicle in a virtual environment. This would be particularly useful for drivers who are unable to operate a physical steering wheel due to disabilities or injuries.",
    "Smart Steering Wheel: Design a steering wheel that incorporates advanced technology such as sensors, cameras, and AI to provide real-time feedback to the driver. The wheel could display information such as speed, fuel level, and navigation directions, and could even offer suggestions for improving driving habits. Additionally, the wheel could be equipped with advanced safety features such as automatic emergency braking and lane departure warning.",
    "Interactive Steering Wheel: Create a steering wheel that responds to voice commands and other inputs, allowing drivers to control various functions of their vehicle without needing to physically touch the wheel. This could include things like adjusting the temperature, changing the radio station, and even sending messages to passengers. The wheel could also be equipped with a touchscreen display for additional functionality.",
    "Adjustable Steering Wheel: Design a steering wheel that can be adjusted to fit the driver's body and preferences. The wheel could be made of a flexible material that can be molded to fit the driver's grip, and could include adjustable features such as tilt, reach, and height. This would help to improve comfort and reduce fatigue during long drives.",
    "Multi-Function Steering Wheel: Create a steering wheel that serves as a central hub for a variety of vehicle functions. The wheel could include buttons, dials, and other controls for things like the radio, climate control, and navigation system. This would help to reduce clutter on the dashboard and make it easier for drivers to access the functions they need while on the road."
