    "Smart Thermos: Create a thermos that can detect the temperature of the contents and adjust its insulation accordingly. This smart thermos can be controlled through an app on your phone, allowing you to adjust the temperature remotely. It can also track the temperature of your drink over time and provide you with notifications when it reaches the desired temperature.",
    "Multi-Function Thermos: Design a thermos that serves multiple purposes. For example, it can be used as a water bottle, a coffee mug, and a food container. The thermos can be made of a flexible material that can change shape depending on the function you want to use it for. This will make it more convenient for people who are always on the go and need a versatile container for their drinks and snacks.",
    "Thermos with Built-In Cooling System: Create a thermos with a built-in cooling system that can keep your drink cold for a longer period. The cooling system can be powered by a small battery that can be charged through a USB port. This will be especially useful for people who are always on the go and need a reliable thermos to keep their drinks cold.",
    "Thermos with Changing Colors: Design a thermos that changes colors depending on the temperature of the contents. For example, the thermos can turn blue when the drink inside is cold, and red when it's hot. This will provide a fun and unique way to monitor the temperature of your drink without having to open the thermos.",
    "Thermos with Hydrophobic Coating: Create a thermos with a hydrophobic coating that can keep your drinks from spilling or leaking. This coating can be applied to the inside of the thermos, ensuring that your drinks stay inside and don't make a mess. This will be especially useful for people who are always on the go and need a reliable thermos that can keep their drinks safe and secure."
