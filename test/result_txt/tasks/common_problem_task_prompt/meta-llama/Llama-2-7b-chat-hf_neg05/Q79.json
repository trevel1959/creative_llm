    "Homeless Housing Hubs: Establish designated areas in the city where homeless individuals can access temporary housing, job training, and mental health services. These hubs could be set up in vacant buildings, such as old warehouses or abandoned hotels, and would provide a safe and supportive environment for those in need.",
    "Mobile Outreach Services: Create a fleet of mobile units that can travel to different areas of the city to provide on-site services to homeless individuals. These units could include medical and mental health professionals, as well as case workers who can help connect individuals with permanent housing and other resources.",
    "Micro-Units for Micro-Incomes: Develop tiny homes or micro-units that can be rented or purchased at an affordable price. These units could be located in areas of the city with high demand for affordable housing, and could provide a safe and secure place for individuals to live while they work to get back on their feet.",
    "Community Land Trusts: Establish community land trusts, which are nonprofit organizations that own and manage land for the benefit of the community. These trusts could provide affordable housing options, as well as community gardens and other green spaces, to help homeless individuals and families get back on their feet.",
    "Virtual Reality Simulation Training: Create virtual reality simulations that allow individuals to experience what it's like to live in different types of affordable housing options. This could help individuals make more informed decisions about their housing options, and could also help policymakers and developers better understand the needs of homeless individuals and families."
