    "Build a Solar-Powered Water Filtration System: Create a solar-powered water filtration system using materials found on the island. This system would use the sun's energy to purify seawater or rainwater, making it safe for drinking. The system could consist of a solar panel, a water storage tank, and a filtration system made from natural materials such as coconut shells or sand. This would provide a reliable source of clean drinking water, ensuring survival on the island.",
    "Create a Shelter Using Natural Materials: Use the island's natural resources to build a shelter that protects from the elements. Collect leaves, branches, and vines to create a sturdy structure. Add a layer of palm fronds or other waterproof material for added protection. This shelter would provide a safe place to rest, store food and water, and protect from harsh weather conditions.",
    "Make a Fishing Net Using Island Resources: Use the island's resources to create a fishing net that can catch fish in the surrounding waters. Collect long, thin branches or vines and weave them together to create a net. Add weights to the bottom of the net to help it sink, and use a hook made from a shell or rock to catch fish. This would provide a source of protein and help sustain survival on the island.",
    "Create a Signal Fire to Attract Rescue: Build a signal fire on a hill or high point on the island to attract attention from passing boats or planes. Gather dry wood and other flammable materials and create a large fire that can be seen from a distance. This would increase the chances of being rescued and provide hope for survival.",
    "Create a Sustainable Food Source: Use the island's resources to create a sustainable food source. Collect seeds from plants and trees on the island and plant them in a designated area. Tend to the plants and harvest them regularly, providing a consistent source of food. This would help ensure survival on the island and provide a sense of accomplishment and purpose."
