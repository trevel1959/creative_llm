    "**Self-Expanding Suitcase**:    A suitcase that can expand or contract based on the amount of items packed. This could be achieved through a smart material that responds to the weight of the contents. When you pack light, the suitcase remains compact, making it easy to carry. When you need more space, a simple mechanism or app command can trigger the suitcase to expand, providing extra room without compromising on portability.",
    "**Modular Suitcase Design**:    A suitcase that can be disassembled into smaller compartments or modules. Each module could serve a different purpose: one for clothing, one for electronics, one for toiletries, etc. This would allow travelers to customize their packing based on the trip duration and type, making it easier to access specific items without having to rummage through the entire suitcase.",
    "**Eco-Friendly Suitcase with Solar Charging**:    A suitcase made from sustainable materials that features built-in solar panels. This suitcase would not only be environmentally friendly but also provide a way to charge devices while on the go. The solar panels could be integrated into the design of the suitcase, allowing travelers to power their phones, tablets, or other devices without needing to find an outlet.",
    "**Integrated Weight Scale and Alert System**:    A suitcase that comes with a built-in weight scale and a smart alert system. As you pack, the suitcase would provide real-time feedback on the weight of your belongings, ensuring you don’t exceed airline limits. If you’re packing too much, the suitcase could suggest which items to remove or replace with lighter alternatives, helping you avoid last-minute packing dilemmas at the airport.",
    "**Interactive Suitcase with Augmented Reality (AR)**:    A suitcase that features an AR interface on its surface. When a user scans the suitcase with their smartphone or AR glasses, they could see a digital overlay that displays packing tips, destination information, or even a virtual guide to the places they’re visiting. This could enhance the travel experience by providing real-time information and making the suitcase a hub for travel planning."
