    "Carrier Pigeons: In the event of an electronic communication blackout, carrier pigeons could be used as a reliable and slow but sure method of communication. Trained pigeons could be sent with messages attached to their legs, and they could fly across international borders, carrying vital information between countries. This method would be especially useful for urgent messages that require immediate attention.",
    "Morse Code Flares: Morse code flares are signaling devices that use a series of flashes and lights to convey messages. These flares could be launched into the air and used to communicate with ships or aircraft at sea or in the air. By using a predetermined sequence of flashes, messages could be conveyed over long distances, allowing for communication between countries.",
    "Optical Signals: Optical signals could be used to communicate between countries in the absence of electronic communication. This could involve using mirrors or other reflective surfaces to direct laser beams towards specific locations, allowing for the transmission of messages over long distances. This method would require careful planning and coordination, but it could be an effective way to communicate in emergency situations.",
    "Homing Pigeons with GPS: In a modern twist on the traditional carrier pigeon, homing pigeons could be trained with GPS devices to carry messages between countries. These pigeons could be released at strategic locations and use their GPS capabilities to navigate to their destinations, allowing for the rapid transmission of messages over long distances.",
    "Balloon-Borne Messages: Balloons could be used to carry messages between countries in the absence of electronic communication. By attaching a message to a high-altitude balloon, it could be carried across international borders, potentially reaching its destination in a matter of days. This method would require careful planning and coordination, but it could be an effective way to communicate in emergency situations."
