    "**Hardware Limitations**: Not all users may have access to high-end virtual reality (VR) hardware, which could limit the reach of the training program. To solve this, the program could be designed to run on a range of devices, including lower-spec options or even mobile VR, ensuring inclusivity for users with varying resources.",
    "**Motion Sickness**: Some users may experience motion sickness while using VR, which could hinder their training experience. Developers could implement techniques such as teleportation movement or fixed-point navigation to minimize discomfort. Additionally, providing clear guidelines on how to acclimate to VR environments could help users adjust.",
    "**Content Relevance and Engagement**: If the training content is not engaging or relevant to the users' real-world applications, it may fail to hold their attention. To counter this, the program could incorporate gamification elements, real-life scenarios, and interactive challenges that align closely with the users' job roles, making the training more applicable and enjoyable.",
    "**Feedback Mechanisms**: Without effective feedback mechanisms, users may not know how well they are performing or where they need improvement. The program could integrate real-time feedback systems, allowing users to receive immediate evaluations on their actions within the VR environment. This could be complemented by post-training assessments to track progress.",
    "**Scalability of Training Modules**: As the organization grows, the training program may need to scale to accommodate more users or additional content. To facilitate this, the program could be built on a modular architecture, allowing for easy updates and the addition of new training modules without overhauling the entire system."
