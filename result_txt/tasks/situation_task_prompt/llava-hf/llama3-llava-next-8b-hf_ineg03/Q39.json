    "Lip Reading: I would focus on reading lips and facial expressions to understand what others are saying. This skill can be developed over time and would be useful in situations where hearing is not an option.",
    "Tactile Communication: I would use touch to communicate with others. This could include physical gestures, such as tapping or waving, to convey messages. It could also involve using tactile symbols or codes to represent words or ideas.",
    "Writing: I would rely on writing to communicate with others. This could involve using a pen and paper or typing on a computer or phone. It would be a slow but effective way to communicate over the month.",
    "Braille: If I were familiar with Braille, I would use it to communicate with others who are also familiar with the tactile language. This would allow me to read and write messages using raised dots on a page.",
    "ASL (American Sign Language): I would use ASL to communicate with others who are fluent in the language. This would be a useful skill to have during the month without hearing, as it would allow me to express myself and understand others."
