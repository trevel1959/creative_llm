    "**Retro Map Navigation**: Revive the art of traditional map-reading by using analog tools like compasses, protractors, and paper maps. People would need to develop their spatial reasoning and navigation skills to calculate distances, bearings, and latitudes. This method would encourage a return to a more tactile and intuitive approach to navigation.",
    "**Nature-Based Navigation**: Leverage the natural world to aid navigation. For example, using the position of the sun, stars, and constellations to estimate direction and time. People could also use natural landmarks like mountains, rivers, and coastlines to navigate. This method would foster a deeper appreciation for the environment and its ability to provide navigational cues.",
    "**Community-Based Navigation**: Establish a network of community navigators who would share their knowledge and expertise with others. This could involve creating a system of oral traditions, where experienced navigators pass on their skills to others through storytelling and hands-on training. This method would promote social bonding and a sense of community reliance.",
    "**Memory-Based Navigation**: Develop a system of mental mapping, where individuals commit routes and locations to memory. This could involve creating mental topographies, associating landmarks with memories, and using mental landmarks to navigate. This method would require a high degree of cognitive flexibility and creativity.",
    "**Tactile-Based Navigation**: Utilize tactile markers and physical cues to aid navigation. For example, using tactile tape to mark paths, creating tactile maps, or using Braille signage. This method would cater to individuals with visual impairments and promote a more immersive and engaging navigation experience."
