    "Smart Scissors: Integrate technology into the scissors to provide additional features such as a built-in measuring tool, a ruler, or a magnifying glass for precise cutting. The scissors could also have a Bluetooth or Wi-Fi connection to transfer cutting patterns or designs to the scissors.",
    "Environmentally Friendly Scissors: Create scissors made from sustainable materials such as bamboo or recycled plastic. The blades could be coated with a non-stick surface to reduce friction and wear.",
    "Multi-Tool Scissors: Develop scissors that double as a multi-tool, with interchangeable blades for different cutting tasks. For example, a pair of scissors could be designed with a serrated blade for cutting through thick materials, a serrated blade for cutting through fabric, and a curved blade for trimming paper.",
    "Magnetic Scissors: Design scissors with a magnetic feature that holds small metal objects, such as paper clips or small screws, in place while the user is cutting. This would save time and reduce the need for a separate tool.",
    "Adjustable Scissors: Create scissors with adjustable cutting length and angle settings, allowing the user to customize the cutting process for different materials and tasks. This would improve precision and efficiency."
