    "Use reflective surfaces: One idea could be to use reflective surfaces such as mirrors or aluminum foil to scatter sunlight throughout your home or workspace. This can help create a more even distribution of light and make up for the absence of the sun. You can place these surfaces on walls, floors, or even hang them from the ceiling to maximize their effectiveness.",
    "Solar-powered lights: Another solution could be to install solar-powered lights in your outdoor space. These lights harness the energy of the sun during the day and automatically turn on at night, providing light without relying on traditional electricity sources. You could also consider installing motion-sensor lights that only come on when someone is nearby, further conserving energy.",
    "Light boxes: A third option could be to invest in light boxes. These are devices designed to mimic natural light by emitting bright white light that simulates daylight. They can be used in indoor spaces where there isn't enough natural light, such as bedrooms or offices. Light boxes are available in different sizes and shapes, so you can choose one that fits your needs and budget.",
    "Artificial trees: If you have a garden or outdoor space, you could consider planting artificial trees. These trees not only add aesthetic value to your surroundings but also provide natural shade and light. Some artificial trees are designed to glow at night, creating a warm and inviting atmosphere.",
    "Community support: Finally, if you're struggling to find ways to ensure you have enough light during the day, consider reaching out to your community for support. You could organize a group effort to collect reflective materials or work together to install solar-powered lights in public areas. By working together, you may be able to find creative solutions that benefit everyone involved."
