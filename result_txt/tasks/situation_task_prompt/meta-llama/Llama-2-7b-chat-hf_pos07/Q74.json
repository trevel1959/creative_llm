    "Natural DIY Beauty: In a world without cosmetics, I would focus on using natural ingredients to create my own beauty products. I would experiment with different herbs, spices, and essential oils to create face masks, moisturizers, and lip balms. For example, I could mix honey and olive oil to create a nourishing face mask, or use cinnamon and coconut oil to make a soothing lip balm.",
    "Bartering and Trading: In a post-cosmetic world, I would likely rely on bartering and trading to acquire the ingredients I need for my personal grooming habits. I could trade my skills or services, such as gardening or cooking, for essential oils, herbs, or other natural ingredients. This way, I could still maintain my beauty routine without relying on commercial products.",
    "Community-based Beauty: I would join a community of like-minded individuals who share my passion for natural beauty. Together, we could share knowledge, skills, and resources to create a sustainable and collaborative beauty routine. We could work together to cultivate herbs and other natural ingredients, and share recipes and techniques for creating our own beauty products.",
    "Ancient Beauty Secrets: I would study and learn about ancient beauty secrets and techniques from cultures around the world. For example, I could learn about the traditional beauty practices of ancient Egyptians, Greeks, or Chinese, which often involved using natural ingredients like clay, honey, and plant extracts. By incorporating these techniques into my routine, I could create a unique and effective beauty routine that is both sustainable and culturally rich.",
    "Zero-Waste Beauty: In a world without cosmetics, I would focus on creating a zero-waste beauty routine. This would involve using minimal packaging and reusing or repurposing any materials I can. For example, I could use a reusable container for my face cream, or use a cloth pad instead of disposable cotton balls for applying my lip balm. By adopting a zero-waste approach to beauty, I could reduce my impact on the environment and live more sustainably."
