    "**AI-Driven Maintenance Alerts**: Integrating an advanced AI system that learns the driving habits and patterns of the user could lead to proactive maintenance alerts. The system would analyze data from various sensors to predict when parts are likely to wear out or need servicing. This would not only improve vehicle safety but also extend the life of the car by preventing breakdowns before they occur.",
    "**Eco-Friendly Solar Paint**: Develop a special type of paint embedded with solar cells that can charge the car's battery while itâ€™s parked or driving. This would significantly reduce reliance on charging stations and provide a sustainable energy source for electric vehicles. The paint could also be designed to reflect heat, keeping the car cooler in sunny climates and improving energy efficiency.",
    "**Integrated Health Monitoring System**: Equip cars with a health monitoring system that tracks the well-being of the driver and passengers. This could include heart rate monitors and stress level assessments, alerting the driver if they are too fatigued or stressed to drive safely. The system could even suggest breaks or changes in driving routes to avoid stressful situations, enhancing overall safety and comfort.",
    "**Augmented Reality Navigation**: Create a heads-up display that uses augmented reality (AR) to project navigation directions directly onto the windshield. This system would overlay real-time information, such as traffic conditions, points of interest, and potential hazards, allowing drivers to keep their eyes on the road while still receiving crucial information. The AR could also highlight the best routes and suggest scenic drives for leisure trips.",
    "**Multi-Functional Steering Wheel**: Design a steering wheel that incorporates various controls and features, such as touch-sensitive areas for controlling media, climate, and navigation, reducing the need for multiple buttons and switches. The wheel could also have haptic feedback to provide alerts for incoming calls or notifications, allowing drivers to stay connected without taking their eyes off the road."
