It could also include a built-in tie or scarf holder, maximizing space and functionality in the closet.",
    "**Eco-Friendly Hanger with Plant-Based Materials**: Develop a line of clothes hangers made from biodegradable, plant-based materials.

Additionally, they could be infused with essential oils to help keep clothes smelling fresh while in storage.",

    "**Customizable Hanger with Modular Attachments**: Design a modular hanger system that allows users to customize their hangers with different attachments, such as clips for pants, hooks for accessories, or padded sections for delicate fabrics. Users could easily switch out attachments based on their wardrobe needs, promoting versatility and reducing the need for multiple hangers.",
    "**Hanger with Built-in Odor Neutralizer**: Create a hanger that incorporates an odor-neutralizing technology, such as activated charcoal or a specialized fabric that absorbs smells.
