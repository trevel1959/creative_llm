    "**Air Traffic Control Overhaul**: With the sudden influx of humans with the ability to fly, air traffic control systems would need to be drastically revised. Current systems are designed to handle commercial aircraft, not individual flyers. This would lead to a massive overhaul of air traffic control infrastructure, including new communication protocols, navigation systems, and emergency response procedures.",
    "**Economic Shifts**: The ability to fly would revolutionize transportation, making it faster, cheaper, and more efficient. This would disrupt traditional industries such as logistics, shipping, and tourism. New business models and opportunities would emerge, but some companies would struggle to adapt, leading to economic shifts and potential job losses.",
    "**Environmental Impact**: With millions of humans flying, there would be a significant increase in noise pollution, air traffic congestion, and carbon emissions. This could lead to a reevaluation of environmental regulations and the development of more sustainable aviation technologies.",
    "**Social and Cultural Changes**: The ability to fly would fundamentally change the way people interact with their environment and each other. It would open up new opportunities for exploration, recreation, and social connections. However, it could also lead to new forms of social isolation, as people spend more time flying and less time engaging with their communities.",
    "**Psychological and Physiological Impacts**: Humans would need to adapt to the physical and psychological demands of flight, including the effects of gravity, wind resistance, and the need for oxygen. This could lead to new health concerns, such as flight-induced stress, altitude sickness, and the long-term effects of repeated exposure to high-speed flight. Additionally, the thrill of flying could lead to addiction and other psychological issues."
