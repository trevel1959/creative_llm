    "**Adjustable Fit System**: Design roller skates with an adjustable fit mechanism that allows users to easily modify the size of the boot for a perfect fit. This could involve a combination of memory foam padding and a dial system similar to that used in ski boots. This would not only enhance comfort but also improve performance and safety, as a snug fit reduces the risk of blisters and injuries.",
    "**Integrated LED Lighting**: Incorporate customizable LED lights into the wheels or the boot of the roller skates. Users could choose different colors and patterns via a mobile app, allowing them to express their personality and increase visibility during night skating. This feature would not only be stylish but also enhance safety by making skaters more visible to pedestrians and vehicles.",
    "**Modular Wheel System**: Create a modular wheel system that allows users to easily swap out wheels based on their skating style or terrain. For example, softer wheels for outdoor skating on rough surfaces and harder wheels for indoor skating on smooth floors. This system could also include different colors and designs for aesthetic customization, appealing to a wider range of skaters.",
    "**Built-in Shock Absorption**: Develop roller skates with an innovative shock absorption system built into the boot and wheels. This could involve using advanced materials like gel or air pockets that compress upon impact, reducing the strain on joints and providing a smoother ride. This would make skating more comfortable, especially for beginners or those with joint issues.",
    "**Safety Gear Integration**: Design roller skates that come with built-in safety features, such as knee and elbow pads that are seamlessly integrated into the design of the skates. These pads could be retractable or detachable, ensuring that users have protection without the bulk of carrying separate gear. This feature would appeal to parents of young skaters who prioritize safety."
