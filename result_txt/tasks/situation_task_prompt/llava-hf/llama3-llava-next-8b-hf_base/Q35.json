    "Use public transportation: Taking buses, trams, trains, or subways can help you get around if there are no bicycles available. Public transportation is often cheaper and more affordable than owning a car.",
    "Use scooters or mopeds: Scooters and mopeds are small vehicles that can be driven with a license, and they can be a more affordable and convenient way to travel short distances.",
    "Use skateboards: Skateboards are a great way to navigate short distances, especially in urban environments where bike lanes may be limited. They're also easy to carry and store.",
    "Use rollerblades: Rollerblades are another great alternative to bicycles, especially for short distances. They can be used on paved surfaces and are fast and efficient.",
    "Use a scooter or kick scooter: These are similar to scooters but are typically smaller and lighter, making them easy to maneuver and park. They require no license, and both can be found for affordable prices."
