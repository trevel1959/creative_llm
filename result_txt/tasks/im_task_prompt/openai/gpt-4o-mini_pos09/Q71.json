    "**Modular Design**:    Create a modular sleeping bag that can be zipped together with other bags to accommodate multiple sleepers. This would allow families or groups to combine their sleeping bags into a larger, shared space, promoting warmth and togetherness during camping trips. The modular sections could also have different insulation levels for personalized comfort.",
    "**Integrated Mosquito Netting**:    Design a sleeping bag with a built-in, detachable mosquito netting that can be easily deployed when camping in insect-heavy areas. The netting could be stored in a pocket within the bag and unfurled or zipped out when needed, providing a barrier without requiring a separate setup.",
    "**Multi-Function Pocket System**:    Incorporate a multi-function pocket system into the sleeping bag, allowing users to store items like phones, snacks, or water bottles securely. The pockets could be designed with insulation to keep snacks warm or cool, and include a small, built-in solar charger for devices. This would reduce the need for additional gear and keep essentials within easy reach.",
    "**Eco-Friendly Materials**:    Develop a sleeping bag made entirely from sustainable and biodegradable materials, including recycled fabrics and natural insulation like organic cotton or wool. The design could also incorporate water-repellent treatments that are environmentally friendly, appealing to eco-conscious consumers who want to minimize their impact on nature.",
    "**Lightweight and Packable Design**:    Innovate a sleeping bag that is ultra-lightweight and can be compressed into a compact size for easy transport. This could be achieved using advanced materials that maintain warmth without bulk. Additionally, the bag could come with a built-in compression sack that doubles as a pillow when inflated, providing convenience and comfort on the go."
