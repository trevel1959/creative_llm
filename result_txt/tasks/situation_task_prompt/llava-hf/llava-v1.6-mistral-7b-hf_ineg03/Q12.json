    "Solar Heating: Solar heating systems use solar panels to collect and convert sunlight into heat. The panels absorb sunlight and convert it into electricity, which can then be used to power an electric heater. This is a clean and renewable energy source that would be an excellent option if traditional fuel sources were unavailable.",
    "Biomass Heating: Biomass heating systems use organic matter, such as wood, agricultural waste, or even human waste, to produce heat. The organic matter is burned in a boiler to produce steam, which is then used to heat water and produce hot water or steam for heating.",
    "Radiant Floor Heating: Radiant floor heating systems use a network of pipes installed in the floor to circulate hot water. The heat from the hot water is radiated through the floor, providing a comfortable and efficient heating solution.",
    "Passive Solar Heating: Passive solar heating systems use the sun's energy to heat a home without the need for active systems like solar panels. This is achieved by using south-facing windows and thermal mass, such as concrete or brick walls, to absorb and store heat.",
    "Electric Heating: Electric heating systems use electricity to produce heat. This can be achieved through wall-mounted heaters, baseboard heaters, or even underfloor heating systems. While not as efficient as some other heating options, electric heating can be a reliable backup option if traditional fuel sources are unavailable."
