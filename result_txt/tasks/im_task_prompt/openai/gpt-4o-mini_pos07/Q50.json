    "**Solar Charging Back Cover**: Design a smartphone back cover embedded with flexible solar panels that can charge the phone using sunlight. This eco-friendly solution would allow users to extend their phone's battery life during outdoor activities or emergencies without needing a power outlet. The cover could also include a small LED indicator to show charging status and efficiency.",
    "**Augmented Reality (AR) Interaction Layer**: Introduce a secondary layer of augmented reality that allows users to interact with their environment through their smartphone. For example, users could point their camera at a product in a store, and the phone would overlay information such as reviews, price comparisons, or nutritional facts. This feature would enhance shopping experiences and provide valuable information in real-time.",
    "**Modular Hardware Design**: Create a smartphone with a modular design that allows users to easily upgrade or replace specific components, such as the camera, battery, or storage. This approach would not only extend the lifespan of the device but also empower users to customize their phones based on their needs and preferences, reducing electronic waste and promoting sustainability.",
    "**Integrated Health Monitoring**: Develop a smartphone with built-in health monitoring capabilities, including sensors for tracking vital signs such as heart rate, blood oxygen levels, and hydration. The device could sync with health apps to provide users with insights and recommendations for improving their well-being. Additionally, it could alert users to potential health issues, making it a valuable tool for proactive health management.",
    "**Gesture-Controlled Navigation**: Implement advanced gesture recognition technology that allows users to navigate their smartphones without touching the screen. Users could swipe, pinch, or tap in the air to scroll through apps, answer calls, or adjust settings. This feature would enhance accessibility for individuals with mobility challenges and provide a futuristic, hands-free way to interact with the device."
