    "In a small town, there lived a dog named Sketch, who had an extraordinary talent: he could draw! With a tail wagging like a paintbrush, Sketch would grab his owner’s colorful markers and create vibrant masterpieces on large sheets of paper. The townsfolk marveled at his ability, as he captured everything from landscapes to portraits of the children playing in the park. One day, he drew a picture of the town’s beloved fountain, and to everyone’s surprise, it came to life! Water flowed joyfully from the drawing, uniting the community in laughter and wonder, proving that creativity knows no bounds—even for a dog.",
