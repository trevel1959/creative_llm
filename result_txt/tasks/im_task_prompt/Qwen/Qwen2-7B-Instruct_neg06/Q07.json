    "**Toothbrush Plant Watering System:** Design a toothbrush that doubles as a watering tool for indoor plants. The bristles of the toothbrush are made of a porous material that allows water to be absorbed and then slowly released into the soil when the toothbrush is inserted into the soil. This would be particularly useful for people who have trouble remembering to water their plants regularly, ensuring that they always get enough moisture without overwatering.",
    "**Toothbrush as a Dental Hygiene Tracker:** Create a toothbrush that integrates with a smartphone app, tracking brushing habits and reminding users to brush their teeth at least twice a day. The app could also provide personalized brushing techniques based on dental health data, helping users improve their oral hygiene practices.",
    "**Toothbrush as a Portable Oral Care Station:** Develop a compact, portable toothbrush holder that not only keeps your toothbrush clean but also contains toothpaste, floss, and other essential oral care items. It could have a built-in UV sterilizer to keep everything fresh and germ-free, promoting better oral health while being convenient for travel or on-the-go use.",
    "**Toothbrush as a Smart Health Monitor:** Design a toothbrush that collects data about your oral cavity, such as plaque buildup, gum health, and even signs of stress in saliva. This information could be transmitted to a smartphone app, which provides insights into overall oral health and offers personalized recommendations for better dental care.",
    "**Toothbrush as an Interactive Educational Tool:** Create a toothbrush that lights up and plays educational sounds or videos during brushing sessions. This interactive experience could help children learn proper brushing techniques in a fun and engaging way, making dental hygiene a more enjoyable part of their daily routine. Parents could track their child's progress through a companion app, reinforcing good habits."
