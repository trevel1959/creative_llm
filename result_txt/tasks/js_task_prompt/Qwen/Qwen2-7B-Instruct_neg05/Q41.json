    "**Global Educational Standardization**: One rule that could dramatically change the world is the implementation of a global educational standard. This would mean that every country adopts a similar curriculum, teaching methods, and assessment criteria. The purpose behind this rule is to ensure that all individuals receive a comparable education, regardless of where they live. It would promote cross-cultural understanding, facilitate easier mobility for students and professionals, and potentially level the playing field when it comes to job opportunities and personal growth.",
    "**Universal Basic Income (UBI)**: Another idea is to enforce a Universal Basic Income, where every individual receives a regular, unconditional sum of money from the government. The rationale behind this rule is to reduce poverty, provide financial security, and encourage entrepreneurship. With the financial stress removed, people would have more freedom to pursue their passions or start new businesses without fear of financial ruin. This could lead to a more equitable society, where economic barriers are minimized.",
    "**Zero Waste Society**: A rule requiring zero waste production could significantly impact our environment by drastically reducing pollution and resource consumption. This would involve enforcing recycling and composting regulations, promoting sustainable manufacturing practices, and encouraging the use of reusable products. By adopting this rule, we could shift towards a circular economy, where waste becomes a non-issue, and resources are used efficiently and sustainably.",
    "**Digital Detox Periods**: Given the increasing reliance on technology, implementing a rule that mandates digital detox periods could help improve mental health and foster stronger interpersonal relationships. This could involve designated times during the day when using electronic devices is prohibited, encouraging face-to-face interactions and reflection. The benefits would include reduced screen time, improved focus, and enhanced social connections, leading to a healthier work-life balance and overall well-being.",
    "**Global Health Care System**: Enforcing a universal health care system accessible to all citizens worldwide would address the disparities in health care access and quality. This rule would require countries to provide comprehensive medical services, including preventive care, treatments, and vaccinations, without any cost barrier. By doing so, it would contribute to better public health outcomes, reduced health inequalities, and a more resilient population capable of responding to global health crises effectively."
