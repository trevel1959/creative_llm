    "**RFID-Enabled Wallets**: Create wallets that utilize RFID technology to secure items like passports, credit cards, and IDs. These wallets would be equipped with tags that emit radio-frequency signals to authenticate items when scanned by a reader. To ensure security, the wallet could also have a physical locking mechanism that only opens upon the correct authentication sequence. Confidence Score: 0.9",
    "**Biometric Clothing Lockers**: Develop clothing lockers that use biometric data (like fingerprints or facial recognition) to unlock. Each user would have a unique set of biometric data that grants access to their locker. To enhance security, these lockers could also include a motion sensor that alerts the owner if someone tries to tamper with their locker. Confidence Score: 0.85",
    "**Ink-Embedded Security Tags**: Invent security tags that are embedded with unique ink patterns. When these tags are cut or tampered with, they release a specific ink pattern that can be detected using specialized scanners. This would allow stores to quickly identify if an item has been stolen or damaged. Confidence Score: 0.8",
    "**Smart Jewelry with Hidden Storage**: Design jewelry pieces that double as hidden compartments. These pieces could be worn daily and would require a specific key or code to open. For example, a bracelet might have a hidden compartment accessible through a small button that needs to be pressed in a certain way. Confidence Score: 0.75",
    "**Voice-Activated Lockboxes**: Create lockboxes that can be opened with voice commands. These boxes would use advanced speech recognition technology to ensure that only authorized individuals can access them. To further secure the contents, the boxes could have a self-destruct mechanism that activates if unauthorized access attempts are made too many times. Confidence Score: 0.8"
