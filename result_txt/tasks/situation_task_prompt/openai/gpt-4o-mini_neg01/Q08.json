    "**Bioengineered Water Plants**: Innovate genetically modified plants that have enhanced abilities to absorb and filter pollutants from soil and water. These plants would thrive in contaminated environments and, through their natural processes, convert polluted water into clean, drinkable water. By cultivating these plants in urban and rural areas, communities could create sustainable green spaces that not only provide clean water but also enhance biodiversity and aesthetics.",
    "**Solar Desalination Pods**: Create portable solar-powered desalination units that can be deployed in coastal areas or near saltwater bodies. These pods would utilize solar energy to heat seawater, causing it to evaporate and then condense into fresh water. The technology would be designed to be user-friendly and affordable, allowing individuals or small communities to produce their own clean drinking water, even in remote locations.",
    "**Community Rainwater Harvesting Systems**: Design a community-based rainwater harvesting system that collects and purifies rainwater for drinking. These systems would include large, aesthetically pleasing storage tanks equipped with advanced filtration and UV purification technology. Communities could come together to build and maintain these systems, fostering collaboration and resilience while ensuring access to clean water during dry spells.",
    "**Water Purification Drones**: Develop a fleet of drones equipped with advanced purification technology that can scout and purify small water sources. These drones would use UV light, ozone treatment, or other purification methods to clean water on-site, making it safe for drinking. The drones could be deployed in disaster-stricken areas or regions with limited access to clean water, providing immediate relief and support.",
    "**Wastewater Recycling Plants**: Establish decentralized wastewater recycling facilities that use innovative bioreactors and filtration systems to treat and purify sewage and greywater. These plants would convert waste into clean, drinkable water through advanced technologies like membrane bioreactors and reverse osmosis. By integrating these plants into urban infrastructure, cities could significantly reduce water pollution and create a sustainable water supply."
