    "Multi-Blender Mode: Allow the blender to operate in multiple modes simultaneously, such as blending hot or cold ingredients, or blending different types of ingredients at different speeds. This would make the blender more versatile and convenient for various recipes.",
    "Self-Cleaning Function: Incorporate a self-cleaning function that automatically cleans the blender after use. This would include rinsing the blades, removing leftover residue, and sanitizing the interior. This would save time and effort in maintaining the blender.",
    "Customizable Blend Settings: Allow users to create and save their own custom blend settings, such as a \"Smoothie Blend\" or \"Soup Blend.\" This would enable users to quickly and easily access their preferred blend settings without having to reprogram the blender each time.",
    "Smart Blending Timer: Implement a smart timer that automatically turns off the blender when the desired blend time has been reached. This would prevent over-blending and reduce the risk of hot liquids splashing out of the blender.",
    "Expandable Blending Capacity: Allow the blender to expand its blending capacity by adding additional containers or attachments. This would enable users to blend larger quantities of ingredients or to blend multiple containers at once, making it more convenient for larger batches or meal prep."
