    "Elevator Car Rolling System: Develop a system where elevator cars are designed to roll down the sides of the skyscraper instead of moving up and down. This would allow people to ride the cars like a rollercoaster, providing a thrilling and unique way to reach the top of the building.",
    "Gravity-Defying Escalators: Construct escalators that are designed to defy gravity, allowing people to ride them up the side of the skyscraper. The escalators would be equipped with specialized tracks and motors that would create a continuous loop, allowing people to climb the side of the building without any fear of falling.",
    "Skywalker Pathway: Create a network of interconnected sky bridges that would allow people to walk from one side of the skyscraper to the other. The sky bridges would be suspended high above the ground, providing breathtaking views of the city below.",
    "Maglev Lifts: Develop magnetic levitation technology that would allow elevators to move up and down the sides of the skyscraper without touching the sides. This would create a smooth and silent ride, and would also allow for the creation of elevators that could move at incredible speeds.",
    "Pneumatic Tube Transport: Install a network of pneumatic tubes that would transport people from one side of the skyscraper to the other. The tubes would be pressurized with air, allowing people to travel through them at high speeds, while remaining safely inside a pressurized tube."
