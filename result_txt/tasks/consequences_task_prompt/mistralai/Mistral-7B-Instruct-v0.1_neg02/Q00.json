    "The loss of sleep could also have significant environmental consequences, as humans may become less aware of their surroundings and less likely to engage in environmentally conscious behaviors. This could lead to increased pollution, deforestation, and other forms of environmental degradation.",
    "Finally, the loss of sleep could have profound spiritual and philosophical implications, as humans may struggle to find meaning and purpose in life without the restorative power of sleep.
