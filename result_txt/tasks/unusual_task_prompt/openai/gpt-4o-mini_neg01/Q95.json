    "**Homemade Snack Bags**: Transform coffee filters into eco-friendly snack bags for kids or for on-the-go munching. Simply fold a filter into a pouch and secure it with a piece of tape or a small clip. These are perfect for holding popcorn, nuts, or dried fruit and are a great alternative to plastic bags.",
    "**Lens Cleaning Cloth**: Coffee filters are lint-free and soft, making them ideal for cleaning glasses, camera lenses, or smartphone screens. Their texture effectively removes smudges without scratching the surface, making them a great alternative to paper towels or regular cloths.",
    "**Crafting Material**: Use coffee filters as a base for various arts and crafts projects. They can be dyed with food coloring or markers to create beautiful, colorful decorations. Kids can use them to make flowers, butterflies, or even art collages, adding an element of creativity to their playtime.",
    "**Scented Sachets**: Create homemade scented sachets by filling coffee filters with dried herbs, lavender, or potpourri. Simply tie the filter closed with string or a rubber band, and place them in drawers, closets, or under your pillow for a pleasant aroma. This is a natural way to keep spaces smelling fresh.",
    "**Oil Splatter Guard**: When frying food, place a coffee filter over the pan to minimize oil splatters. The filter will allow steam to escape while keeping most of the oil contained, making for a cleaner cooking experience. This is particularly useful for frying bacon or other greasy foods."
