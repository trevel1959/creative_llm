    "Air Traffic Control Overhaul: With everyone being able to fly, air traffic control would need a significant overhaul to ensure safe and efficient flight operations. This could involve implementing new technologies such as automated flight systems and real-time tracking of all aircraft in the sky.",
    "Environmental Impact: The widespread use of personal flying devices could have a significant impact on the environment, including increased air pollution and noise levels. Governments would need to implement regulations to mitigate these effects, such as limiting the number of flights per day or requiring the use of electric or hybrid-powered planes.",
    "Economic Disruption: The ability to fly would disrupt traditional modes of transportation, such as cars and buses, leading to changes in the job market and economic activities. Airlines and other companies that rely on ground transportation could see a decline in business, while new industries related to personal flying could emerge.",
    "Social Changes: The ability to fly could lead to significant social changes, including increased mobility for people living in remote areas and the potential for more frequent travel between countries. However, it could also create inequalities, with only those who can afford personal flying devices having access to this new technology.",
    "Safety Concerns: While the ability to fly sounds exciting, there are also safety concerns to consider. Accidents involving personal flying devices could be more severe than those involving traditional vehicles, and there may be a need for additional training and certification requirements for pilots. Additionally, there could be issues with privacy and surveillance, as governments and law enforcement agencies could potentially monitor the movements of individuals who can fly."
