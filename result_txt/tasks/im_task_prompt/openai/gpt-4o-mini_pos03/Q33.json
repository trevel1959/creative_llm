    "**Self-Cleaning Technology**: Implement a self-cleaning feature that utilizes ultrasonic waves to break down residue and a specialized detergent that can be automatically dispensed. After blending, users could simply add water and a cleaning solution, press a button, and the blender would clean itself, making the post-blending process hassle-free.",
    "**Modular Blender System**: Design a modular blender that allows users to swap out different blending attachments based on their needs. For instance, a smoothie attachment for softer ingredients, a heavy-duty attachment for ice and nuts, and a whisk attachment for emulsifying. This would provide versatility and reduce the need for multiple appliances.",
    "**Integrated Nutrient Analyzer**: Create a blender with an integrated nutrient analyzer that can provide real-time feedback on the nutritional content of the blended ingredients. Users could see the breakdown of vitamins, minerals, and calories, helping them make healthier choices and better understand their dietary intake.",
    "**Eco-Friendly Materials and Energy Efficiency**: Develop a blender made from sustainable materials, such as recycled plastics or biodegradable composites. Additionally, incorporate energy-efficient technology that uses less power during operation and has a standby mode that consumes minimal energy when not in use.",
    "**Bluetooth Connectivity and App Integration**: Allow the blender to connect via Bluetooth to a smartphone app. The app could provide guided blending recipes, monitor blending progress, and allow users to control the blender remotely. Users could also share their favorite recipes with a community of other blender enthusiasts."
