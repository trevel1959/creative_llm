    "**Smart Laundry Cycle**: Develop a washing machine that adjusts its cycle based on the type of fabric, soil level, and desired level of cleanliness. This would be achieved through advanced sensors and AI-powered algorithms that learn the user's preferences over time. The machine would also provide real-time feedback and suggestions for optimal laundry care.",
    "**Laundry Sorting Robot**: Create a robotic arm that can sort and separate clothes within the washing machine, eliminating the need for manual sorting. This would be especially helpful for households with multiple people, as it would save time and reduce the risk of clothes getting damaged during the washing process.",
    "**Eco-Friendly Laundry System**: Design a washing machine that uses a combination of ozone and UV light to sanitize clothes, reducing the need for harsh chemicals and minimizing water consumption. This system would also include a built-in water recycling feature, allowing for maximum water efficiency.",
    "**Virtual Reality Laundry Experience**: Develop a washing machine that incorporates virtual reality technology, allowing users to immerse themselves in a relaxing environment while their clothes are being washed. This could include calming visuals, soothing sounds, and even guided meditation sessions to make the laundry experience more enjoyable.",
    "**Laundry Folding Assistant**: Create a robotic arm that can fold and organize clothes with precision and speed, making it easier for users to put away their laundry. This would be especially helpful for people with mobility issues or those who struggle with folding clothes due to arthritis or other physical limitations."
