    "**Smart Helmet with Integrated Augmented Reality Display**: Design a high-tech bicycle helmet that incorporates an augmented reality (AR) display. This display would provide riders with real-time information about their surroundings, such as traffic updates, navigation directions, and even warnings about potential hazards like potholes or debris. The AR display would be projected onto a transparent visor, allowing riders to see their surroundings while still accessing valuable information. The helmet could also include features like crash detection, GPS tracking, and integration with popular fitness apps.",
    "**Eco-Friendly Helmet Made from Recycled Materials**: Develop a bicycle helmet made from recycled materials, reducing waste and promoting sustainability. The helmet could be crafted from a combination of recycled plastics, bioplastics, or even plant-based materials. This eco-friendly helmet would not only appeal to environmentally conscious cyclists but also provide a unique marketing opportunity for companies looking to promote their green initiatives.",
    "**Smart Helmet with Integrated Air Quality Monitoring**: Create a bicycle helmet equipped with air quality sensors that monitor and report on the rider's surroundings. This feature would be particularly useful in urban areas with high levels of air pollution. The helmet could provide real-time data on particulate matter, ozone levels, and other pollutants, helping riders make informed decisions about their route or schedule. The data could also be shared with local authorities or environmental organizations to help improve air quality.",
    "**Bicycle Helmet with Integrated LED Lighting System**: Design a bicycle helmet with a built-in LED lighting system that provides enhanced visibility and safety. The helmet could feature programmable LED strips that adapt to different riding conditions, such as daytime, nighttime, or inclement weather. The lighting system could also include features like turn signals, brake lights, or even a \"follow me\" mode for group rides. This innovative lighting system would increase the rider's visibility and safety, making it an attractive feature for commuters and long-distance cyclists.",
    "**Customizable Helmet with 3D-Printed Accessories**: Develop a bicycle helmet with interchangeable 3D-printed accessories that allow riders to personalize their gear. This could include customized visors, straps, or even decorative elements like logos or patterns. The 3D-printed accessories would be made from lightweight, durable materials and could be designed to meet specific riding styles or preferences. This approach would enable riders to express their individuality and make their helmets stand out from the crowd. [/INST] Assistant: I hope these ideas meet your expectations!
