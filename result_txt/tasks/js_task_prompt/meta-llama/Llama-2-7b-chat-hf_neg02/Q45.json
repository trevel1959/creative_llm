    "Echolocation Sense: Create a new human sense that allows individuals to perceive their surroundings through sound waves, similar to how bats and dolphins navigate. This sense, called \"Echolocation,\" would involve the ability to emit high-frequency sounds through the mouth or nose and detect the echoes that bounce back, providing a 3D image of the surrounding environment. This sense would be particularly useful for navigating in dark or confined spaces, such as caves or tight hallways, and could also enhance the ability to detect subtle sounds, like faint noises from far away or hidden predators.",

This sense would revolutionize communication, allowing people to connect with each other instantly and effortlessly, regardless of distance or language barriers.",
