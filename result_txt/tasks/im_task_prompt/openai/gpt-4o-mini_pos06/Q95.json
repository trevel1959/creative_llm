    "**Foldable and Stackable Design**: Create a laundry basket that can be easily folded flat when not in use, making it space-efficient for small living areas. Additionally, design it so that multiple baskets can stack on top of each other, allowing users to separate colors, whites, and delicates without taking up extra floor space.",
    "**Built-in Sorting Compartments**: Design a laundry basket with built-in compartments that can be used for sorting clothes as they are placed in the basket. These compartments could be removable and labeled (e.g., \"whites,\" \"colors,\" \"delicates\"), making it easier to organize laundry without having to sort it again later.",
    "**Odor Neutralizing Technology**: Integrate materials that have odor-neutralizing properties or even a small compartment for dryer sheets or fabric softeners. This would help to keep the laundry basket smelling fresh, especially for items that may sit for a while before washing.",
    "**Eco-Friendly Materials and Design**: Use sustainable materials such as recycled plastics or bamboo to construct the laundry basket. Additionally, design it to be easily disassembled for recycling purposes, promoting environmental consciousness among users.",
    "**Laundry Basket with Wheels and Handle**: Create a laundry basket equipped with wheels and a retractable handle for easy transport. This would be particularly beneficial for those who have to carry laundry up and down stairs or across long distances, making the process much more convenient."
