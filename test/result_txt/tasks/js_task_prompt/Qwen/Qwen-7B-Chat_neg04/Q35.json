    "Dodo bird - The dodo bird was a flightless bird that lived on the island of Mauritius. It became extinct in the late 17th century due to overhunting and habitat loss. Bringing it back to life would allow scientists to study its behavior and learn more about its biology, which could help us protect other endangered species.",
    "Woolly mammoth - The woolly mammoth was a large herbivore that roamed the Arctic tundra during the Ice Age. Its extinction is believed to have been caused by climate change and hunting by humans. Bringing it back to life would allow us to study its adaptations to cold weather and learn more about how climate change has affected past ecosystems.",
    "Tyrannosaurus rex - The tyrannosaurus rex was a massive carnivorous dinosaur that lived during the Late Cretaceous period. It is one of the most well-known dinosaurs and has fascinated people for centuries. Bringing it back to life would allow us to study its behavior and learn more about its anatomy and physiology.",
    "Pterodactyl - The pterodactyl was a flying reptile that lived during the Mesozoic Era. It had wings made of skin stretched over elongated bones, and could fly up to 60 miles per hour. Bringing it back to life would allow us to study its behavior and learn more about how flying creatures evolved.",
    "Saber-toothed cat - The saber-toothed cat was a large predator that lived during the Pleistocene epoch. It had long canine teeth that were used as weapons against prey. Bringing it back to life would allow us to study its behavior and learn more about how predators evolved to hunt different types of prey."
