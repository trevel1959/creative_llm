    "Smart Matchbox: Create a matchbox that uses AI to detect the type of wood it is holding and automatically adjust the strikability of the match. The matchbox can also use a built-in LED light to illuminate the area around the match, making it easier to strike the match in the dark.",
    "Fire-Resistant Matchbox: Develop a matchbox with a fire-resistant material, such as silicone or ceramic, to prevent the match from igniting accidental fires. The matchbox can also have a built-in safety mechanism, such as a pressure plate, that only allows the match to be struck when the box is held in a safe position.",
    "Shape-Shifting Matchbox: Create a matchbox that can change its shape to accommodate different types of matches. For example, the box could have a flat surface for standard matches, a rounded surface for candle matches, and a curved surface for fire starter matches.",
    "Matchbox with Built-In Lighter: Design a matchbox with a built-in lighter that can be used to light the match. This would eliminate the need for an external lighter and make it easier to use the matchbox in situations where a lighter is not available.",
    "Interactive Matchbox: Create a matchbox that can be controlled using a smartphone app. The app can adjust the strikability of the match, turn on an LED light, or even light the match automatically. This would make it easier to use the matchbox in situations where it is difficult or dangerous to strike a match manually."
