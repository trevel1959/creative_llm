    "**Reflection in Water**: If all mirrors vanished, people could still see their reflections in calm bodies of water, such as lakes, ponds, or even the ocean. The water's surface would act as a natural mirror, allowing individuals to see their own image. This could lead to interesting situations, like people trying to take selfies with their reflections in the water or using the water as a makeshift mirror to practice makeup or hairstyles.",
    "**Smart Contact Lenses**: With the absence of mirrors, the next logical step would be the development of smart contact lenses that can display a person's reflection. These lenses could be equipped with tiny cameras, AI-powered algorithms, and a display screen, allowing individuals to see their own reflection in real-time. This technology could revolutionize personal grooming, fashion, and even social media.",
    "**Augmented Reality Glasses**: In a world without mirrors, augmented reality (AR) glasses could become the new norm. These glasses would use AR technology to project a person's reflection onto a virtual screen, allowing them to see themselves from any angle. This could be especially useful for people who struggle with self-esteem or body image issues, as they could use the AR glasses to practice positive affirmations and build confidence.",
    "**Biometric Feedback Systems**: Without mirrors, people might rely more heavily on biometric feedback systems to monitor their physical appearance. These systems could use sensors to track a person's vital signs, body temperature, and other health metrics, providing them with a sense of their overall well-being. This could lead to a more holistic approach to self-care, where individuals focus on their health and fitness rather than their physical appearance.",
    "**Artistic Expression**: The absence of mirrors could lead to a resurgence in artistic expression, particularly in the realm of self-portraiture. Artists might use unconventional materials and techniques to create their own reflections, such as using light, shadow, or even 3D printing. This could result in a new wave of innovative and thought-provoking art that challenges traditional notions of self-representation. [/INST] Assistant: These ideas are all quite imaginative and could lead to some interesting consequences in a world without mirrors. The first idea, **Reflection in Water**, is a practical solution that would allow people to see their reflections in natural bodies of water. The second idea, **Smart Contact Lenses**, is a more futuristic solution that would require significant technological advancements but could revolutionize personal grooming and social media. The third idea, **Augmented Reality Glasses**,"
