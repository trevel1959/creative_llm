    "**Community Resistance**: Changes to public transportation can meet resistance from community members who fear losing their current routes or services. For example, if a bus route is eliminated or altered, it may disproportionately affect low-income residents who rely on that service for commuting to work or accessing essential services. Engaging with the community through public forums and consultations is essential to address concerns and build support for the changes.",
    "**Logistical Challenges**: Implementing a new transportation system involves complex logistical planning. Issues such as coordinating schedules, integrating different modes of transport (like buses, trains, and bikes), and ensuring accessibility for people with disabilities can complicate the overhaul. Additionally, the need for new infrastructure (like bus lanes or train stations) can disrupt existing traffic patterns and create temporary inconveniences for residents.",
    "**Environmental Impact**: While the goal of overhauling public transportation is often to reduce carbon emissions and promote sustainability, the construction phase can have significant environmental impacts. This includes noise pollution, air quality degradation, and potential harm to local wildlife. Careful planning and environmental assessments are necessary to mitigate these impacts and ensure that the new system aligns with sustainability goals.",
    "**Technological Integration**: Modernizing a public transportation system often involves the integration of new technologies, such as real-time tracking, mobile ticketing, and electric vehicles. However, these technologies can be expensive to implement and maintain. Additionally, there may be challenges related to data privacy and cybersecurity, as well as the need for staff training to effectively use and manage new systems.",
    "**Equity and Accessibility Issues**: An overhaul must prioritize equity to ensure that all community members have access to reliable transportation. This includes addressing the needs of marginalized groups, such as low-income individuals, the elderly, and people with disabilities. If the new system fails to consider these groups, it could exacerbate existing inequalities and limit access to jobs, education, and healthcare."
