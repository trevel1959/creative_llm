    "**Satellite Weather Monitoring System:** Without clouds, traditional cloud-based weather prediction methods become ineffective. Therefore, the development of advanced satellite systems becomes crucial. These satellites would continuously monitor Earth's surface and detect temperature changes, wind patterns, and other atmospheric conditions. By analyzing these data, meteorologists could predict weather changes accurately. ",
    "**Air Pressure Tracking:** Clouds often form due to air pressure changes. Without them, monitoring air pressure at various points on the globe becomes essential for predicting weather. Scientists could install a network of air pressure sensors worldwide, collecting real-time data. These sensors would help track shifts in air pressure, which can indicate upcoming storms or high-pressure systems causing clear, sunny weather.",
    "**Infrared Imaging:** Clouds block sunlight from reaching Earth's surface. Without them, infrared imaging devices could be used to measure heat radiation emitted by the ground. By analyzing this data, scientists could determine whether the surface is warming up (indicating a potential heatwave) or cooling down (suggesting a cold front). This method could provide early warnings for extreme weather events.",
    "**UV Radiation Levels:** Clouds also protect the Earth's surface from harmful ultraviolet (UV) radiation. Without them, UV levels would increase, affecting temperatures and potentially leading to increased evaporation rates. Monitoring UV radiation levels using specialized instruments could help predict changes in humidity and evaporation patterns, giving insights into future weather conditions.",
    "**Ocean Temperature Sensors:** Clouds play a role in moderating ocean temperatures. Without them, ocean temperature variations could become more pronounced, affecting local weather patterns. Deploying a network of underwater sensors to monitor ocean temperatures could provide valuable information about regional weather changes. By analyzing these data, meteorologists could predict how warmer or cooler ocean temperatures might influence nearby weather systems."
