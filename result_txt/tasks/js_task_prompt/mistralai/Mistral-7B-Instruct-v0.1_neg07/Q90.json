    "Increase the size of the brain: One of the most significant changes I would make to the human body is to increase the size of the brain. By doing so, we would have more space for the brain to store more information and improve cognitive abilities. This would allow us to process information more quickly, think more deeply, and make better decisions.",
    "Improve circulation: Another change I would make is to improve circulation. By increasing the size of the blood vessels and improving the flow of blood, we would be able to deliver more oxygen and nutrients to the body's cells. This would improve overall health and reduce the risk of diseases such as heart disease and stroke.",
    "Enhance immune system: Another change I would make is to enhance the immune system. By improving the body's ability to fight off infections and diseases, we would be able to stay healthier for longer and reduce the risk of premature death.",
    "Increase energy: Another change I would make is to increase energy levels. By improving the body's ability to generate and store energy, we would be able to perform physical activities for longer periods and be more productive throughout the day.",
    "Improve system: Another change I would make is to improve the digestive system. By improving the body's ability to digest food and absorb nutrients, we would be able to maintain a healthy weight and reduce the risk of digestive disorders such as diabetes and heart disease."
