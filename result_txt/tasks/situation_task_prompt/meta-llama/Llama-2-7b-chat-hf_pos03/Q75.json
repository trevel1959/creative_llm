    "Hydrogen Fuel Cells: One potential solution to power vehicles if all the world's oil suddenly disappeared is to switch to hydrogen fuel cells. Hydrogen fuel cells are clean and efficient, producing only water and heat as byproducts. They use hydrogen as a fuel and oxygen from the air to produce electricity, which can be used to power electric vehicles.",
    "Solar Power: Another option would be to harness the power of the sun to generate electricity. Solar panels could be installed on buildings and roads, converting sunlight into electricity to charge electric vehicles. This would not only provide a clean and renewable source of energy but also reduce the need for traditional fossil fuels.",
    "Nuclear Power: Nuclear power plants could also be used to generate electricity to power vehicles. Nuclear power plants produce a significant amount of electricity, and with advancements in technology, they can become safer and more efficient. The electricity generated could be used to power electric vehicles, reducing the need for fossil fuels.",
    "Advanced Battery Technologies: Advances in battery technology could also play a crucial role in powering vehicles without oil. Researchers are working on developing more efficient and longer-lasting batteries that can store more energy, reducing the need for frequent charging. These advanced batteries could be used to power electric vehicles, making them more practical and accessible to the masses.",
    "Biofuels: Biofuels are another alternative to traditional fossil fuels. These fuels are derived from organic matter such as plants, algae, or agricultural waste. Biofuels can be used to power internal combustion engines, providing a cleaner and more sustainable alternative to traditional fossil fuels. With the right feedstock and processing technologies, biofuels could play a significant role in reducing the world's reliance on oil."
