    "**Teeth Whitening Toothbrush**: Design an electric toothbrush that utilizes LED lights to emit blue light, a scientifically proven method for teeth whitening. The toothbrush would come with replaceable heads that have small, LED light-emitting diodes embedded in them. Users would apply a whitening gel or paste to their teeth and brush as usual, with the blue light enhancing the whitening process. The device could also be paired with a mobile app that tracks usage and progress.",
    "**Smart Oral Hygiene Coach**: Develop an AI-powered toothbrush that not only cleans but also teaches proper brushing techniques. It would feature sensors that detect the angle and pressure of brushing strokes and provide real-time feedback via a companion app on smartphones. This would help users improve their brushing habits over time, ensuring they cover all areas of their mouth effectively.",
    "**Customizable Oral Care System**: Create a modular electric toothbrush system where the handle is separate from the brush head. Users can choose from various brush heads tailored to different needs (e.g., sensitive teeth, gum health, plaque removal) and swap them on the same handle. This would allow for personalized oral care routines, with the ability to switch heads based on the user's current dental concerns or preferences.",
    "**Eco-Friendly Toothbrush**: Introduce an electric toothbrush made entirely from sustainable materials such as bamboo, recycled plastics, or natural rubber. The brush head would be rechargeable and replaceable, reducing waste and promoting environmental responsibility. Additionally, the device could be designed with a wireless charging stand made from renewable resources, further emphasizing its eco-friendly credentials.",
    "**Vibration Therapy Toothbrush**: Combine the benefits of vibration therapy with an electric toothbrush. The device would feature adjustable vibration frequencies that can be tailored to different areas of the mouth, helping to alleviate pain and tension associated with conditions like TMJ disorder. The vibrations could also stimulate blood flow and reduce inflammation in the gums, contributing to overall oral health. This toothbrush could include a feature that allows users to track their stress levels through vibrations, providing a unique way to monitor their oral health in relation to their general well-being."
