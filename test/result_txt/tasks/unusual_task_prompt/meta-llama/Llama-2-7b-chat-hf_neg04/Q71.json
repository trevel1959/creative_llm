    "A teapot that transforms into a bird feeder: The teapot would have a hidden compartment inside that could be accessed by removing the lid. This compartment would hold birdseed, and when the teapot is placed outside, the birds can access the seed through small holes in the design. This creative teapot would allow you to enjoy your tea while also providing a source of sustenance for your feathered friends.",
    "A teapot that changes color based on the temperature of the tea: This teapot would have a special thermometer built into the design that would detect the temperature of the tea inside. As the tea heats up or cools down, the teapot would change color accordingly. For example, if the tea is too hot, the teapot might turn red, while if it's too cold, it might turn blue. This teapot would add a fun and dynamic element to the tea-drinking experience.",
    "A teapot that plays music: This teapot would have a small speaker built into the design, and when the tea is poured, it would play a soothing melody. The music could be set to a specific temperature, so that the teapot would play a different tune depending on how hot or cold the tea is. This teapot would add a unique and enjoyable element to the tea-drinking experience, and could even be used as a way to relax and unwind after a long day.",
    "A teapot that uses steam to clean surfaces: This teapot would have a special design that allows it to harness the power of steam to clean surfaces. When the tea is poured, the steam would rise from the teapot and be channeled through a small nozzle, allowing it to clean surfaces such as countertops, mirrors, and windows. This teapot would be a convenient and eco-friendly way to keep your home clean and tidy.",
    "A teapot that serves as a planter: This teapot would have a special design that allows it to double as a planter for small plants or herbs. When the tea is poured, the teapot would have a hidden compartment that can be accessed by removing the lid. This compartment would hold the soil and plants,"
