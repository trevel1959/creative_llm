    "**Eco-Cities Rise from the Ashes**: With the world running out of oil, cities adapt to become self-sustaining eco-cities. These cities harness renewable energy sources like solar, wind, and hydro power. Buildings are designed with green roofs, walls, and integrated vertical farming systems. Transportation shifts to electric or hydrogen fuel cell vehicles, reducing emissions and dependence on fossil fuels. Residents live in harmony with nature, enjoying a cleaner, healthier environment. As oil scarcity becomes the norm, the global economy shifts towards a more sustainable, eco-friendly model, leading to a significant reduction in greenhouse gas emissions and a healthier planet.",
    "**The Great Migration**: As oil becomes scarce, industries that rely heavily on it begin to collapse. Millions of people are displaced from their jobs, leading to a massive migration of workers to areas with more abundant resources. This leads to a significant shift in the global workforce, with people moving towards regions with a strong focus on renewable energy, sustainable agriculture, and eco-friendly manufacturing. Governments and international organizations must work together to provide support and resources for these migrants, ensuring a smooth transition and minimizing the social and economic impact.",
    "**The Rise of Local Economies**: With oil scarcity, local economies begin to flourish as people turn to traditional, self-sufficient practices. Communities come together to create cooperatives, focusing on local food production, craft manufacturing, and renewable energy generation. This shift towards local economies promotes community resilience, reduces reliance on global supply chains, and fosters a sense of belonging and connection among residents. As people focus on what they can control, local businesses and initiatives thrive, creating a more diverse and vibrant economic landscape.",
    "**The End of Globalization as We Know It**: The world running out of oil marks the end of an era of globalization, as trade and commerce become increasingly difficult. Borders become more porous, and local economies become the norm. Global supply chains collapse, and international trade agreements are renegotiated or abandoned. This leads to a significant reduction in greenhouse gas emissions, as goods are produced and consumed locally, reducing transportation-related emissions. However, it also leads to a period of economic upheaval, as countries and industries adapt to the new reality.",
    "**The Dawn of a New Era of Exploration**: With oil scarcity, humanity is forced to look beyond the Earth for new sources of energy. Space exploration and colonization become a priority, as scientists and engineers work to harness the energy of the sun, wind, and other celestial bodies. This leads to"
