    "**Smart Soap Dispenser**: Design a smart soap dispenser that uses motion sensors to detect when hands are near. It can dispense the perfect amount of soap every time, saving product and water. It could also connect to your smartphone via an app for easy refill reminders, tracking usage, and even adjusting the soap amount based on the number of people in your household.",
    "**Scented Soap Dispenser**: Create a dispenser that incorporates different scents into the soap itself. Users can choose from various fragrances such as lavender, peppermint, or lemon to enhance their bathing experience. The scent could be infused during the manufacturing process or added through a separate scent cartridge.",
    "**Hygiene Reminder Dispenser**: This dispenser could include a digital screen reminding users to wash their hands regularly and providing tips on proper handwashing techniques. It could even incorporate a quiz to test user knowledge about hygiene practices and reward correct answers with additional soap or discounts on future purchases.",
    "**Eco-Friendly Refillable Dispenser**: Develop a dispenser made from sustainable materials that allows for easy refilling using refillable pods or cartridges. This would encourage users to reduce waste by reusing the same dispenser over multiple fill-ups, promoting environmental sustainability.",
    "**Customizable Dispenser**: Offer a dispenser that users can customize with different colors, shapes, and designs to match their bathroom decor or personal preferences. It could also allow for customization of the soap type, scent, and even the dispenser's functionality (e.g., adjustable soap output or a built-in timer)."
