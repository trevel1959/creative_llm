    "**Pet Grooming Tool**: A hairbrush can be a great tool for grooming pets, especially those with longer fur. It can help remove loose hair and detangle knots. Just ensure that the bristles are gentle enough for your pet's skin to avoid irritation. This could be particularly useful for smaller animals like rabbits or guinea pigs.",
    "**Art Brush**: Use an old hairbrush to create unique textures in your paintings. The bristles can be used to apply paint in a different way than traditional brushes, allowing for interesting patterns and effects. You can also use it for splattering paint or creating a stippling effect.",
    "**DIY Hairbrush Holder**: Instead of tossing your hairbrush in a drawer or on a counter, you can transform it into a decorative holder for other items. Simply glue or attach a small base to the handle and use it to hold pens, makeup brushes, or even small flowers, creating a unique centerpiece for your vanity.",
    "**Scent Diffuser**: You can turn a hairbrush into a scent diffuser by applying a few drops of essential oil to the bristles. As you brush your hair, the heat from your scalp will help disperse the fragrance, providing a subtle and pleasant aroma throughout the day.",
    "**Textured Candle Holder**: If you have an old hairbrush that you no longer use, you can turn it into a creative candle holder. Melt wax and pour it into the brush’s base, placing a wick in the center. Once it hardens, you’ll have a uniquely textured candle that can serve as a conversation piece."
