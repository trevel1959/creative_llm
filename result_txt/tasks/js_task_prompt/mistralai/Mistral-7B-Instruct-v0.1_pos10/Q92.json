    "-90:-90 degree rotation: This rotation would result in-90 degrees, meaning the would be perpendicular to the plane of the orbit. This would create a unique and interesting system with a diverse range of angles and perspectives.",
    "-90 degrees with a-90 degree tilt: This rotation would result in a system with a 90-degree tilt on the dwarf planet orbit. This would create a diverse range of angles and perspectives, with some planets orbiting at a 90-degree angle to the plane of the orbit.",
    "multiple dwarf planet orbits: This would result in a system with multiple dwarf planet orbits. This would create a diverse range of angles and perspectives, with each dwarf planet orbiting at a different angle to the plane of the orbit.",
    "dwarf planet orbits with-90 degrees: This would result in a system with dwarf planet orbits that are perpendicular to the plane of the orbit. This would create a diverse range of angles and perspectives, with some planets orbiting at a 90-degree angle to the plane of the orbit.",
    "dwarf planet orbits with a dwarf planet moon: This would result in a system with dwarf planet orbits that include a dwarf planet moon. This would create a diverse range of angles and perspectives, with some planets orbiting at a 90-degree angle to the plane of the orbit, while the dwarf planet moon orbits around the dwarf planet."
