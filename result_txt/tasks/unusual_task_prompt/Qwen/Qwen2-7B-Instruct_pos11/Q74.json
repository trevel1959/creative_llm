    "**Innovative Vehicle Interface Design:** The steering wheel could be transformed into an interactive, touch-sensitive interface. Sensors would detect the driver's gestures, allowing for more intuitive control over the vehicle's systems. For instance, swiping left or right could change the music playlist, while pinching and spreading fingers could adjust the volume. This design enhances user experience by making interactions with the car's features quicker and more natural.",
    "**Emergency Response System Integration:** A built-in emergency button on the steering wheel could quickly summon help in case of a critical situation. When pressed, it would not only call the emergency services but also provide real-time location data, medical information from the vehicle's database (like allergies or medical conditions), and even send a live video feed to the responding units. This feature significantly improves safety and response times during emergencies.",
    "**Autonomous Driving Mode:** The steering wheel could become a key element in the autonomous driving mode of vehicles. Instead of just a passive component, it could act as a control mechanism for manual override. Drivers would have the ability to take control in critical situations without needing to remove their hands from the wheel, ensuring safety while still offering human control when necessary.",
    "**Virtual Reality Entertainment Hub:** By integrating VR technology, the steering wheel could transform into a full-fledged entertainment system. It would allow drivers to enter a virtual reality environment, where they could play games, watch movies, or attend virtual events. The wheel would function as a controller, providing immersive gaming experiences and making long drives feel shorter and more engaging.",
    "**Health Monitoring and Personalized Feedback:** The steering wheel could incorporate health sensors to monitor vital signs like heart rate, blood pressure, and even stress levels. Based on these readings, it could provide personalized feedback and recommendations, such as suggesting rest breaks or recommending calming music when the driver shows signs of fatigue or stress. This proactive approach to health management enhances overall safety and well-being on the road."
