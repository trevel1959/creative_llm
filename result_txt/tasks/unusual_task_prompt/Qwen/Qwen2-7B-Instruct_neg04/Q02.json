    "**Virtual Reality Integration**: Create a VR experience where users wear gloves that are designed to mimic the sensation of touching various objects. The gloves have sensors that detect the user's movements and send signals to the rubber hands attached to their wrists. This could be used for training purposes, such as teaching someone how to use new tools or equipment without real-world risks.",
    "**Interactive Art Installation**: Develop an interactive art installation where participants can manipulate a large, life-size rubber hand. Using sensors and motion tracking technology, the hand responds to the participant's actions, creating an immersive and engaging experience. This could be displayed in museums, galleries, or public spaces, encouraging interaction and exploration.",
    "**Educational Tool for Sensory Development**: Design a rubber hand that is used in therapy sessions for children with sensory processing disorders. The hand could have various textures and temperatures that can be adjusted based on the child's needs, helping them develop their sense of touch and potentially improving their overall sensory integration.",
    "**Virtual Typewriter**: Create a physical or virtual typewriter where the keys press onto a rubber hand, and the user types as they would on a traditional keyboard. This could be used for nostalgia purposes, educational settings, or as a creative tool for writers who prefer the tactile experience of typing.",
    "**Augmented Reality Game**: Develop an AR game where players control a rubber hand in a virtual environment using their own hand movements. The game could involve tasks like catching items, solving puzzles, or performing tasks that require precise hand-eye coordination. This combines the fun of gaming with the educational value of physical movement and problem-solving."
