    "Build a large floating platform: One idea could be to construct a large, sturdy platform that could float on the water. This platform could be designed to be self-sustaining and equipped with all the necessary amenities for travel, such as sleeping quarters, food and water supplies, and a means of propulsion.",
    "Use a hydroclever: Another idea could be to use a hydrofoil, a type of aircraft that uses jet propulsion to lift off the water's surface and hover above it. This could be an efficient and eco-friendly way to travel across large bodies of water.",
