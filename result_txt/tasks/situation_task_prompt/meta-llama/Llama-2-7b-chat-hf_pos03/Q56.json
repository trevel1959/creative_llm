    "Magic Mirrors: The world could have a secret underground network of magic mirrors that still reflect people's reflections. These mirrors could be hidden in caves, forests, or other secret locations, allowing people to still see themselves.",
    "Virtual Reality: With the help of advanced virtual reality technology, people could use VR headsets to see their reflections in a virtual world. This would allow them to still see themselves even if physical mirrors disappeared.",
    "Memory Reflections: People could use their memories of their own reflections to \"see\" themselves even if physical mirrors were gone. They could close their eyes and visualize their past reflections, or they could ask others to describe their appearance to them.",
    "Reflection-Seeking Communities: People could form communities where they gather together to seek out reflections of themselves. They could use a combination of technology and in-person meetups to connect with others who have mirrors, or they could create their own makeshift mirrors using reflective surfaces like pools of water or polished rocks.",
    "Mind-Reading Technology: A new technology could be invented that can read people's minds and display their reflections on a screen. This technology could be called \"MindMirrors\" and could be used to allow people to see their reflections even if physical mirrors are gone."
