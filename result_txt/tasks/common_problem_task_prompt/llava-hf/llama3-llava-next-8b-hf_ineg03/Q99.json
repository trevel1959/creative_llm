    "High cost: Another potential issue is the high cost of developing and implementing the technology. This can be mitigated by focusing on cost-effective manufacturing processes and targeting the technology to a wider audience, including those who cannot afford it.",
    "Training and support: Ensuring that the visually impaired are able to use the technology effectively can be a challenge. Providing training and support through accessible materials, such as audio guides and tactile diagrams, can help address this issue.",
    "Privacy concerns: There may be concerns about the privacy of the visually impaired, as the technology may involve the collection of personal data. Ensuring that the technology is designed with privacy in mind, and that users have control over their data, can help address this issue.",
    "Inclusivity: The technology should be designed to be inclusive of people with different types of visual impairments, such as those with low vision, blindness, or color blindness. This can be achieved by incorporating a variety of features and settings that can be customized to meet the individual needs of each user.",
    "Compatibility: Ensuring that the technology is compatible with a wide range of devices and platforms can be a challenge. This can be addressed by developing the technology to be device-agnostic, and by providing support for multiple platforms."
