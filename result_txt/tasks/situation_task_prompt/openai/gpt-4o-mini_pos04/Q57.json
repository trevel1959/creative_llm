    "**Underwater Habitat**: Inspired by marine biology, this idea involves creating submerged cities made of transparent materials that allow natural light to filter through. These habitats would be equipped with artificial intelligence systems to manage air quality and temperature. Living underwater would provide a unique perspective on marine life, and the cities could be designed to cultivate coral reefs, promoting biodiversity.",
    "**Vertical Floating Farms**: This concept combines agriculture with urban living by constructing tall, floating skyscrapers dedicated to farming. Each level would be designed for different types of crops, using hydroponics and vertical farming techniques. Residents could live in the upper levels, while the lower levels would focus on food production, creating a sustainable environment that minimizes the need for land.",
    "**Mobile Floating Communities**: Instead of fixed locations, this idea envisions a fleet of modular floating homes that can be relocated based on climate conditions and resource availability. These homes would be equipped with renewable energy sources and designed for easy assembly and disassembly. The community could travel together, allowing for a nomadic lifestyle while still maintaining social connections.",
    "**Reclaimed Coastal Cities**: In this scenario, existing coastal cities would be reimagined as floating urban environments. Infrastructure would be retrofitted to include floating platforms, parks, and public spaces. Streets would be replaced with canals, and transportation would rely on boats and personal watercraft. This adaptation would preserve the cultural heritage of the cities while embracing the new reality of rising sea levels.",
    "**Bioluminescent Floating City**: Inspired by the beauty of bioluminescent organisms, this city would incorporate glowing elements into its architecture. Buildings could be designed with bioluminescent materials that light up at night, creating a magical atmosphere. The city would also focus on sustainable practices, such as using algae for energy and creating green spaces that enhance biodiversity."
