    "**Innovative Ski Pole Design for Improved Grip and Comfort**: Design ski poles with an ergonomic grip that changes shape as it moves down the pole. The lower part of the grip could be wider to provide better stability while the upper part could have a smaller, more slender design for comfort during long hikes or uphill skiing. This design would cater to both comfort and functionality, making it easier for skiers to maintain control and endurance throughout their trip.",
    "**Interactive Ski Pole System**: Develop a smart ski pole system that includes sensors to monitor the skier's performance and adjust the grip tension based on the terrain. The poles can also connect to a smartphone app, providing real-time feedback on speed, balance, and technique, helping skiers improve their skills and reduce the risk of injury.",
    "**Solar-Powered Ski Poles**: Create ski poles equipped with solar panels capable of charging an integrated battery. The battery could power LED lights at the tip of the poles, enhancing visibility in low-light conditions, especially useful during early morning or late evening ski sessions. This eco-friendly option not only improves safety but also reduces the environmental impact by minimizing the need for additional batteries.",
    "**Adjustable Length Ski Poles for Children**: Design ski poles that can easily be adjusted in length to accommodate children as they grow. This innovation would allow families to purchase a single set of poles that can grow with their child, reducing costs and waste. The adjustable mechanism could be simple and intuitive, ensuring safety and ease of use.",
    "**Smart Poles for Ski Touring**: Develop ski poles with built-in navigation systems, allowing skiers to follow marked trails using GPS technology. These poles could display directions, altitude, and even suggest optimal routes based on weather and snow conditions. This feature would be particularly useful for solo skiers or those unfamiliar with the terrain, enhancing safety and the overall skiing experience."
