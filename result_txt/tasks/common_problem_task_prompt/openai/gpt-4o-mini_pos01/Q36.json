    "**Regulatory Hurdles**: Local zoning laws and regulations may pose significant challenges. Some areas may have restrictions on the installation of solar panels due to aesthetic concerns, historical preservation rules, or homeowner association regulations. Navigating these legal frameworks could delay installations and lead to conflicts with residents.",
    "**Intermittent Energy Supply**: While solar panels generate energy, their output is dependent on sunlight, which can be inconsistent due to weather conditions. This intermittent supply could lead to issues with energy reliability for households that depend solely on solar energy, especially during prolonged periods of cloudy weather or in winter months.",
    "**High Initial Costs**: Despite the long-term savings on energy bills, the initial investment for solar panel installation can be prohibitively high for many homeowners. This could create disparities in who can afford the installation, leading to inequities within the community. Financial assistance programs or incentives may be necessary to address this issue.",
    "**Maintenance and Repairs**: Solar panels require regular maintenance to operate efficiently. Homeowners may not be aware of the upkeep required, leading to potential performance issues. Furthermore, if a panel is damaged, the cost and logistics of repairs can be a burden, especially for those unfamiliar with the technology.",
    "**Grid Integration Challenges**: If a significant number of homes install solar panels, the local power grid may struggle to integrate the increased decentralized energy production. This could lead to grid instability, necessitating upgrades to the infrastructure, which can be costly and time-consuming."
