    "**DIY Stylus for Touch Screens**: In a pinch, the tip of a pen can be repurposed into a stylus for touchscreen devices. By wrapping a small piece of conductive material (like aluminum foil) around the tip, users can create a makeshift stylus that works for tablets and smartphones, perfect for sketching or navigating without fingerprints.",
    "**Plant Watering Device**: A pen can be converted into a slow-release watering tool for plants. By filling the pen with water and inserting it upside down into the soil, it can provide a slow drip of moisture over time, ensuring plants receive consistent hydration without overwatering.",
    "**Puzzle Solver**: A pen can serve as a makeshift tool for solving puzzles, such as Sudoku or crossword puzzles. By using the pen's cap to point at letters or numbers, users can visualize connections and strategies without making permanent marks on their puzzle sheet. It can also help in erasing mistakes by rubbing the ink off with the side of the cap."
