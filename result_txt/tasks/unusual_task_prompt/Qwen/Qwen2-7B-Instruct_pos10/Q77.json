    "**Magnetic Garden Sculptures**: Create unique garden sculptures using magnets. The magnets can be embedded into metal or plastic pieces that can be placed on various surfaces like rocks, trees, or fences. The idea is to make the sculptures interactive, where garden visitors can rearrange the pieces as they wish, creating a new artwork every time.",
    "**Magnetic Clothing Line**: Design a clothing line that uses magnets for closures instead of traditional buttons, zippers, or snaps. This could be particularly useful for children's clothing, where magnetic closures are easier to manage. The magnetized clothing could also have additional magnetic patches for attaching badges, name tags, or other accessories.",
    "**Magnetic Education Tools**: Develop an educational tool that combines learning with play using magnets. For example, create a magnetic puzzle board that teaches basic math skills, vocabulary, or geography. Each piece could contain a magnetic number, word, or country, which students can arrange to solve problems or answer questions.",
    "**Magnetic Kitchen Utensil Organizer**: Design a kitchen utensil organizer that utilizes magnets to hold knives, spoons, and forks on the wall. This not only keeps the kitchen clutter-free but also makes utensils easily accessible. The organizer could have magnetic strips where users can attach custom-made holders for different types of utensils.",
    "**Magnetic Art Collage Board**: Create a large magnetic collage board that can be used as a collaborative art project. Participants can add magnetic pictures, words, or designs to create a collective piece of art. This can be used in classrooms, community centers, or public spaces, encouraging creativity and teamwork."
