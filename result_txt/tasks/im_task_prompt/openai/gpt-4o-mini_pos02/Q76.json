    "**Multi-Functional Hair Tie**: Create a hair tie that doubles as a small accessory or tool. For instance, it could include a mini hairbrush or comb within the band itself, allowing users to easily smooth out any flyaways or tangles on the go. Alternatively, it could have a small hidden compartment for storing emergency items like bobby pins or a small emergency cash stash.",
    "**Color-Changing Hair Tie**: Introduce a hair tie made from thermochromic material that changes color with temperature. This could be fun for users who want to express their mood or match their outfit. The color change could be triggered by body heat, so it would change as the user exercises or is in different environments.",
    "**Eco-Friendly Hair Tie**: Design a hair tie made from biodegradable materials or recycled fabrics. This would cater to environmentally conscious consumers and reduce plastic waste. The hair tie could also be marketed with a recycling program, encouraging users to return old ties for proper disposal or recycling.",
    "**Customizable Hair Tie**: Offer a hair tie that can be personalized with interchangeable charms or designs. Users could purchase a base hair tie and then select from a variety of clips or charms that can be attached or detached based on their outfit or mood. This could include themes like holidays, hobbies, or even initials.",
    "**Heated Hair Tie**: Innovate a hair tie that features a gentle heating element, designed to help style hair as it is worn. The heat could be adjustable and provide a soft curl or wave to the hair while the tie is in place, eliminating the need for additional styling tools and saving time in the morning routine."
