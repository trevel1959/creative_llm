    "**Subterranean Habitats**: With rising sea levels making coastal areas uninhabitable, subterranean living could become a viable option. These habitats would be constructed deep underground, utilizing advanced insulation and ventilation systems to maintain comfortable temperatures. Residents would enjoy natural light through strategically placed skylights and grow food in underground farms using hydroponics. Community spaces would be designed to foster social interaction, with art installations and recreational areas that mimic natural environments.",
    "**Treehouse Communities**: In response to the oceanâ€™s encroachment, people could retreat to elevated treehouse communities in forested areas. These homes would be built high in the canopy, providing stunning views and a sense of connection to nature. Each treehouse would be designed with eco-friendly materials and would feature rope bridges connecting them to create a communal atmosphere. Solar energy and rainwater harvesting systems would provide sustainable living solutions, while shared gardens and outdoor spaces would encourage community bonding.",
    "**Mobile Eco-Villages**: To adapt to changing landscapes, mobile eco-villages could be created using eco-friendly RVs or tiny homes on trailers. These villages would travel to different locations as needed, allowing residents to follow the most suitable climate and resources. Each eco-village would be equipped with solar panels, composting toilets, and rainwater collection systems, emphasizing sustainability. Community gatherings and workshops would promote skills sharing and cooperation among residents.",
    "**Skyward Living in Vertical Farms**: As land becomes scarce due to rising waters, vertical farming skyscrapers could emerge as a solution. These high-rise buildings would not only house residents but also integrate agricultural spaces for growing food. The design would include terraces for gardens, aquaponics systems, and greenhouses, allowing residents to produce their own food. Rooftop gardens would provide communal spaces for relaxation and socialization, while energy-efficient systems would minimize the ecological footprint.",
    "**Amphibious Homes**: These innovative dwellings would be designed to float on water but could also rest on land during low tides. Constructed with buoyant materials and adjustable foundations, amphibious homes would adapt to changing water levels. Each home would feature large windows to maximize natural light and views of the water. Sustainable technologies, such as wind turbines and solar panels, would power these homes, while community docks would facilitate boating and water-based activities."
