    "**Eco-Friendly, Biodegradable Toothbrush**: Create a toothbrush made entirely from sustainable materials, such as bamboo and plant-based bioplastics. The bristles could be made from biodegradable nylon alternatives. This toothbrush would decompose naturally after disposal, reducing plastic waste in landfills and oceans. The packaging could also be compostable, promoting an eco-conscious lifestyle.",
    "**Toothbrush with Replaceable Heads and Customizable Handles**: Design a toothbrush that allows users to replace only the head when it wears out, reducing waste. The handle could come in various designs and colors, allowing for customization. Users could even choose ergonomic shapes that fit comfortably in their hands, enhancing the brushing experience while being environmentally friendly.",
    "**Toothbrush with Built-in UV Sanitizer**: Integrate a UV light sanitizing feature within the toothbrush that activates after use. This function would eliminate bacteria and germs on the bristles, ensuring a cleaner brushing experience. The UV sanitizer could be powered by a rechargeable battery and would automatically turn off after a set time, making it convenient and safe.",
    "**Toothbrush with a Timer and Pressure Sensor**: Develop a toothbrush that includes a built-in timer and pressure sensor. The timer would ensure that users brush for the recommended two minutes, while the pressure sensor would alert users if they are brushing too hard, which can damage gums and enamel. The toothbrush could vibrate or emit a gentle sound to indicate when to change quadrants or when to stop.",
    "**Interactive Toothbrush for Kids**: Create a toothbrush designed specifically for children that features fun characters and interactive elements. The toothbrush could connect to a companion app with games and rewards for brushing regularly. For example, the app could feature a character that \"grows\" or earns points as the child brushes effectively, turning oral hygiene into an engaging and motivating activity."
