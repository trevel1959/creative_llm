    "**Development of New Sensory Aids**: People could potentially adapt to their vision loss by developing new sensory aids. For example, a wearable device that enhances other senses like hearing or touch in environments where visual cues are essential. This could involve creating smart clothing with sensors that detect vibrations or temperature changes, which correspond to visual information.",
    "**Enhanced Audio-Visual Communication Systems**: In a world without glasses or contacts, communication methods might evolve significantly. People might develop advanced audio-visual systems to convey spatial information, such as soundscapes that change based on one's location within a room, or tactile feedback devices that simulate textures or distances.",
    "**Cultural Adaptations and Social Norms**: Without glasses or contacts, societies might adapt culturally to accommodate vision loss. This could lead to new social norms and practices, such as the widespread adoption of hand gestures, sign language, or non-verbal cues to convey information effectively. Cultural events and public spaces might also be designed with accessibility in mind, reducing the need for visual guidance.",
    "**Augmented Reality for Navigation and Everyday Tasks**: The reliance on technology might increase significantly. People might start using advanced AR applications that overlay digital information onto the real world. For example, an AR app could provide text-to-speech descriptions of objects, directions, or warnings about obstacles. This could lead to the creation of more user-friendly AR interfaces and tools specifically designed for everyday use.",
    "**Revolutionary Training Programs for the Blind**: With the disappearance of glasses and contacts, there might be a surge in demand for training programs focused on developing skills that enhance other senses, such as echolocation (the ability to navigate using sound). Such programs could teach individuals how to \"see\" through sound, enhancing their spatial awareness and allowing them to navigate complex environments with confidence. Additionally, these programs might include training in Braille, tactile mapping, and other techniques to compensate for visual impairment."
