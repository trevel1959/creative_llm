    "**Integrated Heating and Cooling Technology**: Design a chair with temperature control features. Using conductive materials and a built-in fan system, the chair could warm up during colder months or cool down during hot weather. This could be powered by a rechargeable battery, allowing users to adjust their seating comfort according to the season or personal preference.",
    "**Modular Components**: Create a chair that can be easily reconfigured for different uses. For example, parts of the chair could be detached or rearranged to transform it from a standard dining chair to a lounge chair or even a reclining chair. This modular design would cater to various settings, such as homes, offices, or event spaces, making it versatile and space-efficient.",
    "**Smart Ergonomics with Sensors**: Equip the chair with sensors that monitor the user's posture and provide real-time feedback through a connected app. The chair could gently vibrate or send notifications if the user is slouching or sitting in an unhealthy position for too long. This technology could promote better sitting habits and overall health.",
    "**Eco-Friendly Materials with Customization Options**: Use sustainable materials like bamboo, recycled plastics, or biodegradable composites to construct the chair. Additionally, offer customers the option to customize colors, patterns, and finishes through an online platform, allowing them to design a chair that matches their personal style and eco-conscious values.",
    "**Built-in Storage Solutions**: Design the chair with hidden compartments for storage, such as under the seat or in the armrests. These compartments could be used to store items like magazines, remote controls, or even a small blanket. This would help keep living spaces tidy while providing easy access to everyday items."
