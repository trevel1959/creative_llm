    "**Soundwave Sculpture**: Design a bicycle bell that doubles as a soundwave sculpture. The bell's metal body would be shaped like a stylized soundwave, with each curve and wave representing a different musical note. When the bell is rung, it would produce a unique, harmonious sound that changes pitch and tone depending on the angle of the bell. The soundwave design would also create a visually striking effect, making the bicycle stand out in a crowd.",
    "**Glow-in-the-Dark**: Create a bicycle bell that absorbs light during the day and emits a soft, glow-in-the-dark effect at night. The bell would be made from a special material that reacts to UV light, allowing it to charge up during the day and glow softly in the dark. This would make the bicycle more visible in low-light conditions, increasing safety for riders.",
    "**Shape-Shifting**: Design a bicycle bell that changes shape and color in response to the rider's surroundings. Using advanced materials and sensors, the bell would detect changes in temperature, humidity, and light levels, and adjust its shape and color accordingly. For example, it might change from a bright red to a soothing blue in response to a change in weather.",
    "**Smart Bell**: Develop a bicycle bell that integrates with the rider's smartphone or smartwatch. The bell would use Bluetooth or Wi-Fi to connect with the rider's device, allowing them to customize the sound, receive notifications, and even track their route and speed. The bell could also alert the rider to potential hazards, such as pedestrians or other cyclists, using a built-in sensor and alarm system.",
    "**Musical Instrument**: Create a bicycle bell that doubles as a musical instrument. The bell would be designed to produce a wide range of tones and sounds, from simple melodies to complex rhythms. Riders could use the bell to create music on the go, or even compose and record their own songs. The bell could also be used to alert pedestrians or other cyclists in a more musical and engaging way."
