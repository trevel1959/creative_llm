    "**Augmented Reality (AR) Viewfinder**: Integrate an AR viewfinder that overlays helpful information onto the live view. This could include composition guides, real-time histogram displays, and exposure settings. Additionally, it could suggest optimal shooting angles and settings based on the scene being captured, enhancing the photographer's decision-making process.",
    "**AI-Powered Scene Recognition**: Incorporate advanced AI that can analyze a scene and suggest the best settings or shooting modes. For example, if the camera detects a sunset, it could automatically switch to a mode that enhances warm colors and adjusts exposure for the best results. This would be particularly beneficial for amateur photographers looking to improve their skills.",
    "**Modular Design for Customization**: Create a modular camera system that allows users to easily swap out components such as lenses, sensors, and grips. This would enable photographers to customize their cameras based on their specific needs, whether they're shooting wildlife, landscapes, or portraits. Additionally, it could reduce waste by allowing users to upgrade individual parts instead of replacing the entire camera.",
    "**Smart Storage Solutions**: Integrate a smart storage system within the camera that automatically organizes and tags photos as they are taken. Using AI, the camera could categorize images by location, subject, and even mood, making it easier for users to find and share their favorite shots later. This feature could also include cloud integration for seamless backup and sharing options.",
    "**Gesture-Controlled Functionality**: Introduce gesture control capabilities that allow photographers to adjust settings or take pictures without physically touching the camera. For instance, a simple wave of the hand could change the shooting mode, while a thumbs-up gesture could trigger the shutter. This would be especially useful for capturing candid moments or for photographers who want to avoid camera shake."
