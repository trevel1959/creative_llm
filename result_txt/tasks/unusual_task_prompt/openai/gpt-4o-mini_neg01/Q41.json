    "**Confetti Maker**: Use a pencil sharpener to create colorful confetti for parties or celebrations. Instead of sharpening pencils, you can sharpen pieces of colored paper or old birthday cards. The shavings that come out can be used as festive confetti for decorating tables or filling balloons.",
    "**Essential Oil Diffuser**: If you have a manual pencil sharpener, you can repurpose it as a makeshift essential oil diffuser. Simply place a cotton ball soaked in your favorite essential oil inside the sharpener's chamber. The small openings will allow the scent to disperse into the air, creating a pleasant aroma in your workspace.",

    "**Miniature Art Supply Organizer**: Instead of just sharpening pencils, use a pencil sharpener as a quirky organizer for tiny art supplies.
