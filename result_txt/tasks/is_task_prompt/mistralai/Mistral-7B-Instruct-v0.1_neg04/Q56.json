    "A house that walks could be a combination of a mobile home and a robot. It could have wheels on the bottom that allow it to move around on its own, and a robotic arm on the top that can pick up and move objects. This would be a unique and innovative way to combine the mobility of a mobile home with the convenience of a robot.",
    "The house could be designed to walk on its own, but it could also be controlled remotely. This would allow for a level of flexibility and control that is not typically found in traditional homes. It could be used for a variety of purposes, such as transportation, delivery, or even as a vacation rental.",
    "The house could be designed to walk on its own, but it could also be powered by renewable energy sources such as solar or wind power. This would make it a sustainable and environmentally friendly option for those looking for a unique and innovative way to live.",
    "The house could be designed to walk on its own, but it could also be used as a mobile office or workspace.

    "The house could be designed to walk on its own, but it could also be used as a mobile art gallery or museum.
