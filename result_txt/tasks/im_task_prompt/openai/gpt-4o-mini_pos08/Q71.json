    "**Modular Design with Expandable Compartments**:    Design a sleeping bag with a modular approach, allowing users to add or remove compartments based on their needs. For example, if someone is camping with a partner, they can attach an extra compartment for additional space. Each compartment could also serve a dual purpose, like a storage pocket for gear or a detachable pillow section, providing versatility for different camping scenarios.",
    "**Built-in Sleep Tracker and Smart Alarm**:    Incorporate a sleep tracking technology into the sleeping bag that monitors sleep patterns and provides feedback on sleep quality. This could be done through sensors embedded in the fabric. Additionally, a smart alarm feature could gently wake the user at the optimal time during their sleep cycle, ensuring they feel refreshed and ready for the day ahead.",
    "**Eco-Friendly and Self-Repairing Fabric**:    Develop a sleeping bag made from eco-friendly materials that are also self-repairing. This innovative fabric could use microcapsules containing a polymer that reacts to small punctures or tears by sealing them automatically. Not only would this extend the life of the sleeping bag, but it would also appeal to environmentally conscious consumers looking for sustainable outdoor gear.",
    "**Lightweight Solar Charging Panel**:    Integrate lightweight, flexible solar panels into the outer layer of the sleeping bag. These panels could charge small devices like phones or headlamps while camping. Users could simply lay the bag out during the day to harness solar energy, making it a practical choice for extended outdoor trips where access to electricity is limited.",
    "**Interactive Sleeping Bag with LED Features**:    Create a sleeping bag that features LED lights embedded in the fabric. These lights could serve multiple purposes: providing illumination for nighttime activities, offering safety features for visibility, or even changing colors to reflect the user's mood. An accompanying app could allow users to customize light patterns and colors, adding a fun and personal touch to their camping experience."
