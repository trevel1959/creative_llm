    "Tire-themed art installation: Create a large-scale art installation that incorporates tires in a creative and visually striking way. The installation could feature tires stacked, arranged in a pattern, or used as a canvas for a mural. The piece could be displayed in a public space, such as a park or plaza, and could be designed to interact with the surrounding environment.",
    "Tire-based game: Design a board game or card game that incorporates tires as a central element. Players could roll tires to move around the board, or use tires as a resource to build and create different objects. The game could be simple and easy to learn, but with enough depth to keep players engaged for hours.",
    "Tire-inspired fashion: Create a clothing line that incorporates tires as a design element. The line could include t-shirts, hoodies, hats, and other clothing items that feature tire tread patterns, tire-inspired graphics, or even actual tire parts as embellishments. The clothing could be bold and eye-catching, and could be marketed towards people who appreciate unique and creative fashion.",
    "Tire-themed food: Develop a menu of dishes that incorporate tires as an ingredient. The dishes could be creative and unexpected, such as tire-tread-patterned pizza crusts, tire-tread-shaped cookies, or even tire-tread-infused ice cream. The menu could be served at a themed restaurant or event, and could be marketed towards people who are looking for a unique and memorable dining experience.",
    "Tire-based sculpture: Create a large-scale sculpture that incorporates tires as the primary material. The sculpture could be abstract and modern, or it could be more figurative and representational. The sculpture could be displayed in a public space, such as a park or plaza, and could be designed to interact with the surrounding environment. The sculpture could also be created as a commission for a specific location, such as a corporate campus or a university campus."
