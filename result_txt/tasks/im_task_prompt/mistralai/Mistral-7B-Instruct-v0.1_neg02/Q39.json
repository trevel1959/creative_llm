    "A garden hose that can change color based on the temperature of the water it's pumping. This would make it easier to know if the water is too hot or too cold for certain plants, and could help prevent overwatering or underwatering.",
    "A garden hose that has a built-in filter system to remove harmful chemicals and pollutants from the water before it reaches the plants. This would help ensure that the plants are getting clean, healthy water to drink.",
    "A garden hose that can be controlled remotely using a smartphone app. This would allow users to turn the hose on and off, adjust the water pressure, and even set up timed watering schedules from anywhere.",
    "A garden hose that is designed to be self-cleaning, using a built-in mechanism to remove dirt and debris from the hose as it's used. This would help prevent clogs and reduce the need for frequent cleaning.",
    "A garden hose that is made from a special, eco-friendly material that is biodegradable and compostable. This would help reduce the environmental impact of traditional plastic hoses, which can take hundreds of years to break down."
