The wallet could also include a built-in electrocardiogram (ECG) or a blood glucose monitor for diabetics.",
    "**Wallet with a Built-in Mini Fridge**: Envision a wallet that has a small, temperature-controlled compartment to store perishable items like insulin, medications, or even a small snack. This feature would be particularly useful for people with diabetes or those who need to carry medications with them at all times. The mini fridge could be powered by a small battery or even harvested energy from the user's movements.",
    "**Wallet with a Built-in Microbiome Analyzer**: Create a wallet that includes a tiny laboratory for analyzing the user's microbiome. This could involve a small, portable microscope or a device that uses advanced spectroscopy to detect changes in the user's gut bacteria. This feature would be beneficial for individuals with digestive issues or those interested in tracking their gut health.",
    "**Wallet with a Built-in Air Quality Sensor**: Design a wallet that includes a small air quality sensor, providing users with real-time data on the pollutants and toxins present in their surroundings. This feature would be particularly useful for people with respiratory issues or those who spend a lot of time outdoors. The wallet could also include a built-in air purifier or a mask to help mitigate the effects of poor air quality.",
    "**Wallet with a Built-in 3D Printer**: Envision a wallet that includes a small, portable 3D printer. This feature would allow users to create custom items, such as replacement parts for their wallet or even small tools, on the go. The 3D printer could be powered by a small battery or even harvested energy from the user's movements. This feature would be particularly useful for outdoor enthusiasts or emergency responders who need to create custom items in the field."
