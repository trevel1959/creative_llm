    "Ice Cube Tray as a Dust Pan: Use an ice cube tray as a makeshift dust pan for small items that fall on the floor. Place a piece of paper or cloth in the tray and sweep or scoop small objects into it. The holes in the tray can help to contain the items and make it easier to empty.",
    "Ice Cube Tray as a Plant Propagator: Fill the tray with water and place a cutting from a plant in each hole. The water will help the cuttings to root, and you can eventually transplant them into soil once they've developed roots.",
    "Ice Cube Tray as a Jewelry Organizer: Use the holes in the tray to hold small jewelry items like earrings, rings, and bracelets. You can even add a small amount of water or a dab of jewelry cleaner to each hole to keep the jewelry clean and tarnish-free.",
    "Ice Cube Tray as a Measuring Tool: Fill the tray with water and place it in the freezer. Once frozen, use the tray as a makeshift measuring tool for liquid ingredients. The holes in the tray can be used to measure out specific amounts of liquid.",
    "Ice Cube Tray as a Tea Infuser: Place tea leaves or tea bags in the tray and pour hot water over them. The holes in the tray will allow the water to flow through the tea leaves, steeping them evenly."
