    "Time Dilation: If the speed of light were reduced by half, time dilation would occur, meaning that time would appear to slow down for objects moving at slower than light speeds. This means that if you were to travel at 50% of the speed of light, time would pass more slowly for you compared to someone who is stationary.",
    "Gravitational Redshift: The reduced speed of light would also affect the gravitational redshift, where the light emitted by a massive object is shifted towards the red end of the spectrum due to the gravitational pull. This means that the color of the light emitted by a massive object would appear redder than it would if the speed of light were not reduced.",
    "Radiation Shielding: A slower speed of light would make it more difficult for high-energy radiation to escape from a black hole or neutron star, as the slower light would provide more time for the radiation to interact with the intense gravitational field. This could potentially make these objects even more dangerous to living organisms.",
    "Communication Disruption: With a slower speed of light, communication between objects moving at different speeds would become more difficult. This means that communication between a spacecraft traveling at 50% of the speed of light and a stationary object would be delayed, as the signal would have to travel a longer distance.",
    "Universe Expansion: The reduced speed of light would also affect the expansion of the universe. As the universe expands, the speed of light becomes less relevant, but a slower speed of light would cause the expansion to occur more slowly. This means that the universe would have more time to evolve and change, potentially leading to different types of galaxies and celestial objects."
