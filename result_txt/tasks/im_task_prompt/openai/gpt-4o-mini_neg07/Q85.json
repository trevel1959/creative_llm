    "Smart Bread Box with Humidity Control:** This bread box could feature built-in sensors that monitor the humidity levels inside. Using a small fan and a moisture-absorbing material, it would maintain the ideal humidity to keep bread fresh for longer. The box could connect to a smartphone app, allowing users to track freshness levels and receive notifications when bread is nearing its expiration."
