    "Electric Vehicles: If oil were to disappear, electric vehicles could become the primary mode of transportation. They are already gaining popularity and have the advantage of being powered by renewable energy sources like solar or wind.",
    "Biofuels: Biodiesel and bioethanol, which are made from plant matter, could be used as alternatives to gasoline. These fuels can be produced from a variety of crops and can help reduce greenhouse gas emissions.",
    "Nuclear Power: Nuclear power plants could be used to generate electricity for vehicles. This would require the construction of new nuclear facilities, but it could provide a long-term solution to transportation needs.",
    "Advanced Battery Technology: Improving battery technology to store and distribute energy could enable vehicles to run on electricity generated from renewable sources. This would require the development of more efficient and cost-effective battery storage solutions.",
    "Solar-Powered Vehicles: Vehicles could be equipped with solar panels to harness the power of the sun directly. This would require the development of more efficient solar panels and energy storage systems."
