    "**Wearable Sleep Masks**: Develop high-tech sleep masks equipped with smart features that can adjust to the user's circadian rhythm. These masks would not only block out light but also emit calming scents and sounds to help the wearer relax. They could even use gentle vibrations to guide the user into deeper sleep stages, ensuring a restful experience even in a perpetually bright world.",
    "**Sleep-Optimizing Smart Homes**: Create homes equipped with smart technology that adjusts the environment based on the occupant's sleep schedule. These homes would feature blackout curtains that automatically close when it's time to sleep, temperature control systems that lower the room temperature, and ambient lighting that shifts to mimic the colors of a sunset to signal bedtime.",
    "**Community Sleep Spaces**: Establish community sleep centers designed to offer a tranquil environment for sleep. These spaces would be soundproof and equipped with adjustable lighting, comfortable bedding, and calming decor. People could book time slots to use these spaces, ensuring they have a designated place to escape the constant brightness and enjoy a restful sleep.",
    "**Nature-Inspired Sleep Retreats**: Develop eco-friendly sleep retreats that simulate natural environments, like caves or dense forests, where visitors can escape the bright world. These retreats would feature natural materials, ambient nature sounds, and darkened spaces to promote relaxation and sleep. Guests could engage in mindfulness activities, such as guided meditation or yoga, before resting in a serene setting.",
    "**Flexible Work Hours**: Encourage businesses to adopt flexible work hours that allow employees to work during their most productive times. With no night-time, people could choose to work in shifts that align with their natural sleep cycles, enabling them to sleep during designated \"night\" hours, even if it's artificially created, and ensuring they get the rest they need."
