    "**Self-Cleaning Technology**: Utilize UV-C light technology embedded in the cap of the water bottle that activates with a simple button press or automatically at scheduled intervals. This feature would eliminate harmful bacteria and odors, ensuring that the water remains fresh and the bottle is hygienic without the need for frequent manual cleaning.",
    "**Collapsible Design**: Create a water bottle that can be collapsed into a smaller size when not in use. Made from flexible, durable materials, this bottle would be ideal for travelers or outdoor enthusiasts, allowing for easy storage in backpacks or pockets. It could expand to its full size when filled with water, maintaining a secure seal to prevent leaks.",
    "**Flavor Infuser Chamber**: Incorporate a detachable chamber within the water bottle specifically designed for adding fruits, herbs, or other flavoring agents. This chamber could be easily removed for cleaning and refilling, allowing users to create naturally flavored water on the go. The design could include a mesh strainer to prevent pulp from entering the main water compartment.",
    "**Integrated Filter System**: Design the water bottle with a built-in filtration system that purifies tap water or natural water sources as it is filled. This would be particularly useful for hikers or travelers who may not have access to clean drinking water. The filter could be replaceable and designed to remove impurities, making the water safe and pleasant to drink.",
    "**Temperature Control Technology**: Develop a water bottle that can maintain the temperature of its contents for extended periods. This could be achieved using advanced insulating materials or an internal heating/cooling mechanism. Users could choose to have their water chilled or heated based on preference, with a digital display showing the current temperature."
