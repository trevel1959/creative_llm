    "If all public transport stopped working, how would you travel long distances without a car?",
    "Use a ridesharing app: If you have access to a ridesharing app, you could use it to arrange a ride with a driver. This could be an affordable option if you are traveling in a group or if you are willing to share the ride with others.",
    "Use a carpooling app: If you are traveling with others, you could use a carpooling app to arrange a ride with other people who are also traveling in the same direction. This could be a more affordable option than using a ridesharing app.",
    "Use a taxi: If you need to travel long distances quickly and don't mind the cost, you could use a taxi. This could be an expensive option, but it could be more convenient than other options.",
    "Use a bike-sharing service: If you are traveling in a city with a bike-sharing service, you could use it to rent a bike and ride to your destination. This could be an affordable and eco-friendly option, but it may not be available in all areas."
