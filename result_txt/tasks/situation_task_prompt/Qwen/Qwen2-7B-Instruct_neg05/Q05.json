    "**Creation of Artificial Sunlight**: Develop a system that uses mirrors or lenses to reflect sunlight onto areas where it is needed during the day. This could be in the form of a large-scale solar concentrator, possibly integrated into buildings or urban infrastructure. The system would capture sunlight when it is abundant, store it, and then release it when needed, providing artificial daylight. ",
    "**Innovative Light-Producing Plants**: Cultivate a new species of plants engineered to produce light instead of food. These plants would use photosynthesis normally used for energy to emit light. They could be grown indoors or outdoors, and their light could be directed towards areas needing illumination.",
    "**Solar-Powered Luminous Paint**: Create a type of paint that can absorb sunlight during the day and glow in the dark at night. This could be applied to surfaces like walls, pavements, or road markings to provide additional visibility and safety during the day when natural sunlight diminishes.",
    "**Smart Glass Technology**: Design smart glass windows that can adjust their transparency to control the amount of light entering a building. These windows could be programmed to let more light in during the day when there is no sun, using sensors and AI algorithms to optimize light levels based on the weather and time of day.",
    "**Underground Solar Energy Storage**: Build underground facilities that collect sunlight through a series of mirrors and lenses. The collected sunlight would be converted into heat, which could be stored in thermal storage materials. During periods without sunlight, this stored heat could be used to generate electricity or to power light-emitting devices."
