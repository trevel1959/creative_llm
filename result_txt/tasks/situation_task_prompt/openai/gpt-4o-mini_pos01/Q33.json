    "**Sound-based Timekeeping**: Develop a system using sound to signal the passage of time. For example, create a series of bells or chimes that ring at regular intervals throughout the day. Different sounds could signify different times, such as a deep bell for noon and lighter chimes for morning and evening. This could be a community effort where different neighborhoods or groups have their own unique sounds to create a harmonious timekeeping system.",
    "**Movement Patterns**: Establish a routine based on daily activities that correlate with specific times. For example, you could create a schedule where breakfast is always at sunrise, lunch at midday (when the sun is at its highest), and dinner at sunset. By associating certain tasks with natural events, you create a personal rhythm that can help you gauge the passage of time.",
    "**Shadow Tracking**: Use a stick or a simple gnomon placed vertically in the ground to track time by observing the shadows it casts. The length and direction of the shadow change throughout the day, providing a visual representation of time passing. You could create markings on the ground to indicate specific time intervals based on the shadow's position.",
    "**Body Rhythm Method**: Leverage the body's natural rhythms, such as hunger and fatigue, to estimate time. By observing your own biological clock—when you feel hungry, sleepy, or energized—you can create a rough estimate of the time. For instance, if you notice you feel hungry every four hours, you can plan your meals accordingly and keep track of the day's progression based on your body's cues.",
    "**Community Timekeepers**: Establish a community system where designated individuals, known as \"timekeepers,\" are responsible for keeping track of time based on various methods (e.g., natural cycles, sound signals, etc.). These timekeepers can share updates with the community at regular intervals, creating a collective understanding of time without the need for personal devices."
