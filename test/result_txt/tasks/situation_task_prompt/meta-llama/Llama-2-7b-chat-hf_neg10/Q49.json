    "Create a fire escape plan: Develop a detailed escape plan that includes multiple exit routes from your home, designating a meeting spot outside the home, and practicing the plan with your family at least twice a year. This will help you and your family to quickly and safely evacuate the home in case of a fire.",
    "Use non-traditional fire suppression methods: Consider using alternative fire suppression methods such as using a fire blanket, a fire extinguisher with a non-toxic agent, or even a bucket of water to put out small fires. These methods can be more effective and safer than traditional fire extinguishers, especially if you don't have access to them.",
    "Utilize passive fire protection: Implement passive fire protection measures such as installing fire-resistant doors, windows, and walls, or using fire-resistant materials for construction. These measures can help to slow the spread of a fire and give you more time to evacuate or call for help.",
    "Create a fire-resistant shelter: Build a shelter using fire-resistant materials such as brick, concrete, or metal, and designate it as a safe space in case of a fire. This shelter can provide a safe refuge for you and your family until help arrives.",
    "Invest in fire-fighting technology: Consider investing in fire-fighting technology such as smoke detectors, carbon monoxide detectors, and fire alarms. These devices can help to detect fires early and alert you and your family to evacuate the home quickly."
