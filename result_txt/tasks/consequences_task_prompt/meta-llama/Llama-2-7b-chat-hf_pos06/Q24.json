    "Increased rainfall: The Sahara is one of the driest places on Earth, and turning it into a forest would significantly increase the region's rainfall. This would lead to the formation of lakes, rivers, and wetlands, which would support a diverse array of plant and animal life. Confidence score: 0.8",
    "Cooling of the planet: Trees absorb carbon dioxide from the atmosphere and release oxygen, which would help to cool the planet. The Sahara is currently a massive desert, and turning it into a forest would help to counteract the effects of climate change. Confidence score: 0.9",
    "Disruption of global wind patterns: The Sahara is a major wind belt, and turning it into a forest would disrupt the global wind patterns. This could lead to changes in weather patterns, including more frequent and severe storms. Confidence score: 0.7",
    "Impact on migratory birds: The Sahara is an important stopover for migratory birds traveling between Europe and Africa. Turning it into a forest would alter their habitat, potentially disrupting their migration patterns and affecting their populations. Confidence score: 0.6",
    "Increased biodiversity: The Sahara is currently a monoculture desert, and turning it into a forest would lead to an increase in biodiversity. This would include a wide range of plant and animal species, including many that are currently found in other parts of the world. Confidence score: 0.8"
