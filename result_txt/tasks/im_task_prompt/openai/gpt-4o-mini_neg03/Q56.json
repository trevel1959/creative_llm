    "**Solar-Powered Bicycle Bell**: Design a bicycle bell that incorporates a small solar panel to charge a built-in battery. This would eliminate the need for battery replacements and ensure that the bell is always functional, even on long rides. The solar-powered bell could also feature LED lights that illuminate at night, providing both visibility and a unique design element.",
    "**Multi-Functional Bicycle Bell**: Create a bell that combines multiple functions into one device. For example, the bell could also serve as a small horn, a bike alarm, and even a light. Cyclists could switch between functions depending on their needs, making it a versatile tool for safety and communication while riding.",
    "**Personalized Sound Options**: Develop a bicycle bell that allows users to record their own sounds or select from a library of sounds. This could include anything from quirky noises to personalized messages, making the bell a fun and unique accessory for each cyclist. The bell could also feature a volume control to adjust the sound level based on the environment.",
    "**Haptic Feedback Bicycle Bell**: Introduce a bell that incorporates haptic feedback technology. Instead of a traditional sound, this bell could vibrate the handlebars when activated, providing a silent yet effective way to alert pedestrians and other cyclists. This would be particularly useful in quiet environments or when riding in areas where noise is restricted.",
    "**Interactive Bicycle Bell with Light Indicators**: Design a bell that not only rings but also lights up in different colors based on the situation. For instance, a green light could indicate a friendly greeting to pedestrians, while a red light could signal urgency or a warning to cars. This would provide visual cues in addition to auditory signals, enhancing safety and communication on the road."
