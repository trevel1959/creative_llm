    "**Built-in Pillow and Neck Support**: Design a sleeping bag with an inflatable or memory foam pillow that can be easily tucked away when not in use. Additionally, incorporating a built-in neck support system could enhance comfort, ensuring that users wake up without stiffness or discomfort, especially during long camping trips.",
    "**Integrated Mosquito Netting**: Create a sleeping bag with a built-in, retractable mosquito net that can be deployed when needed. This feature would protect users from insects while allowing them to enjoy fresh air. The netting could be designed to be lightweight and easily stored within the sleeping bag's structure, ensuring it doesn’t add bulk.",
    "**Modular Design for Versatility**: Develop a modular sleeping bag system that can be combined or separated based on the user’s needs. For instance, two bags could zip together for couples or families, or sections could be removed to create a lighter bag for solo trips. This flexibility would cater to different camping scenarios and personal preferences.",
    "**Eco-Friendly Materials with Built-in Clean Technology**: Utilize sustainable, biodegradable materials in the construction of the sleeping bag, while also incorporating a self-cleaning technology. This could involve using fabrics treated with antimicrobial agents that break down dirt and odors over time, reducing the need for frequent washing and extending the bag's lifespan.",
    "**Personalized Comfort Zones**: Design a sleeping bag with adjustable compartments that allow users to customize the level of insulation in different areas (e.g., feet, torso, head). This could be achieved through removable or adjustable insulation panels, enabling users to tailor their sleeping experience based on their unique comfort needs and environmental conditions."
