    "Desalination: Desalination is the process of removing salt and other minerals from seawater to make it suitable for drinking. If there was no more rain, I would collect seawater and use a desalination plant to turn it into freshwater.",
    "Rainwater harvesting: Rainwater harvesting is the process of collecting and storing rainwater for later use. I would build a large tank or series of tanks to collect rainwater from rooftops, surfaces, or ground catchments.",
    "Groundwater pumping: Groundwater is water that is stored underground and can be accessed through wells or boreholes. I would drill deep wells or boreholes to access groundwater and pump it to the surface for use.",
    "Wastewater treatment and reuse: Wastewater is the water that flows out of homes, businesses, and industries. I would treat the wastewater to remove contaminants and bacteria and reuse it for irrigation, flushing toilets, or even drinking.",
    "Solar still: A solar still is a device that uses the sun's heat to distill water from a saltwater source. I would build a solar still and place it in a location where there is plenty of sunlight, such as a desert or near the equator. The still would produce freshwater that could be used for drinking and other purposes."
