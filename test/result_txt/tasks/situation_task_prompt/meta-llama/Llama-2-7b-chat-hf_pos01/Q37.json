    "Build a reverse-propulsion system: Create a system that utilizes a combination of fans, pumps, and ducts to generate a powerful backward thrust. This system would be powered by a high-capacity battery or a small nuclear reactor to ensure sustained operation.",
    "Develop a reverse-orientation parachute: Design a parachute that deploys in the opposite direction of the fall, providing a reverse thrust to slow down the descent. This parachute would be made of lightweight, yet strong materials and equipped with a reliable deployment system.",
    "Use a skateboard with reverse wheels: Design a skateboard with wheels that rotate in the opposite direction of the board's movement, providing a reverse thrust. This skateboard would be equipped with a high-powered electric motor to ensure smooth and efficient movement.",
    "Create a reverse-motion bicycle: Design a bicycle with a unique gear system that allows the wheels to rotate in the opposite direction of the pedaling motion. This would provide a reverse thrust, enabling the rider to move backwards while pedaling.",
    "Develop a reverse-movement exoskeleton: Design an exoskeleton suit that provides a reverse thrust by using a combination of motors and actuators to generate a powerful backward force. This exoskeleton would be equipped with sensors and control systems to allow for precise movement and balance."
