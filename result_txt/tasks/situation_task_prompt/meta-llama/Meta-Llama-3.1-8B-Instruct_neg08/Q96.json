    "**Sculpture Garden**: I would transform the beach into a sculpture garden, where I'd use the absence of sand to create intricate and surreal art pieces. I'd design mounds of pebbles, shells, and other beach treasures to form majestic sculptures that blend seamlessly into the surrounding environment.
