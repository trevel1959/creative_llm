    "**Smart Lock Integration**: Design a smart lock system that integrates with car keys, allowing users to unlock their vehicles with a single tap on their smartphone. This system would utilize Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) technology to establish a secure connection between the car key and the smartphone app. Upon approaching the vehicle, the app would detect the car key's presence and unlock the doors, eliminating the need for physical keys. This innovation would enhance convenience, security, and accessibility for people with disabilities.",
    "**Keyless Entry with Biometric Authentication**: Develop a car key system that incorporates biometric authentication, such as fingerprint or facial recognition, to provide an additional layer of security. This feature would allow users to unlock their vehicles without physically carrying a key, while also ensuring that only authorized individuals can access the vehicle. This technology would be particularly useful for high-security applications, such as government vehicles or luxury cars.",
    "**Car Key Tracking and Recovery**: Create a system that allows users to track their car keys using GPS and Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) technology. If a user misplaces their key, they can use the app to locate it on a map, receive notifications when the key is moved, or even remotely lock the key to prevent unauthorized access. This feature would provide peace of mind and reduce the stress associated with losing car keys.",
    "**Smart Key with Integrated Payment System**: Design a car key that integrates a payment system, allowing users to pay for parking, tolls, or fuel directly from the key. This feature would eliminate the need for separate payment methods, making the driving experience more convenient and streamlined. The key would communicate with payment terminals using Near Field Communication (NFC) technology, ensuring secure and contactless transactions.",
    "**Car Key with Emergency Services Integration**: Develop a car key that integrates emergency services, such as roadside assistance, emergency medical services, or law enforcement, in case of an accident or breakdown. The key would have a built-in panic button or sensor that detects accidents and automatically sends alerts to emergency services. This feature would provide users with an added layer of safety and peace of mind while driving. The key could also be equipped with a built-in phone or a connected device to enable users to communicate with emergency services directly.
