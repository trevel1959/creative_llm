    "Collaborate with others: You could collaborate with other people to create new music. You could gather a group of people with different musical talents and work together to create a new piece of music.",
    "Attend live performances: If all musical recordings were lost, attending live performances would be the only way to hear music. You could attend concerts, festivals, and other live music events to experience the sound of music in person.",
    "Create your own instruments: If all musical recordings were lost, you could create your own instruments using materials found in nature or in your home. For example, you could create a drum set using pots and pans or a flute using a reed and a piece of bamboo.",
    "Listen to nature sounds: If all musical recordings were lost, you could listen to the sounds of nature as a form of music. You could listen to the sound of the wind blowing through the trees, the sound of raindrops on a window, or the sound of a river flowing."
