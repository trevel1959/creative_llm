    "Morse code: Develop a device that can translate written messages into Morse code. This can be done by using a keyboard that sends Morse code signals through a speaker or a device that translates written messages into Morse code. This would allow long-distance communication without the need for a phone.",
    "Radio communication: Use a radio transmitter to send and receive messages over long distances. This would require a radio transmitter and receiver, which can be powered by solar panels or batteries.",
    "Sign language: Develop a sign language app that allows users to communicate through sign language. This app can be used on tablets or other devices and would allow long-distance communication through sign language.",
    "Drone communication: Use drones to deliver messages over long distances. This would require a fleet of drones that can be programmed to fly over long distances and deliver messages.",
    "Satellite communication: Use satellites to communicate over long distances. This would require a satellite network that can be used to send and receive messages over long distances. This would require a significant investment in infrastructure, but it would provide a reliable long-distance communication solution."
