    "**Customizable Weight and Grip System**: Develop a bowling ball with interchangeable weights and grips that can be adjusted based on the player's skill level or physical condition. This would allow bowlers to easily modify their ball to suit their needs, whether they want a heavier ball for more power or a lighter one for better control. The grips could also come in various textures and shapes to accommodate different hand sizes and preferences.",
    "**Interactive Bowling Ball with Augmented Reality (AR)**: Create a bowling ball that integrates AR technology. When viewed through a smartphone or AR glasses, users could see visualizations of their bowling technique, animated tutorials, or even virtual opponents. This would turn practice sessions into an engaging experience, making it easier for bowlers to learn new skills and techniques in a fun and interactive way.",
    "**Eco-Friendly Bowling Ball**: Design a bowling ball made from sustainable materials that are biodegradable or recyclable. This eco-friendly approach would not only reduce the environmental impact of traditional bowling balls but could also appeal to a growing demographic of environmentally conscious consumers. The ball could also come with a return program where used balls can be sent back for recycling or repurposing.",
    "**Bowling Ball with Built-in Cooling System**: Develop a bowling ball that features a built-in cooling system to maintain optimal temperature during games. Overheating can affect the performance of the ball, especially in competitive settings. This cooling feature could ensure consistent performance and help bowlers maintain their grip and control, particularly in warm environments.",
    "**Mood-Sensing Bowling Ball**: Create a bowling ball that can detect the bowler's mood through biometric sensors. It could analyze factors like heart rate and grip pressure to assess stress levels or excitement. Based on this data, the ball could provide feedback or even change its weight or grip to match the bowler's emotional state, helping them to find their ideal balance and improve their game."
