    "**Modular Design**: Create a helmet with interchangeable components that allow users to customize their helmets for different riding conditions. For instance, users could add a visor for sun protection, ear covers for colder weather, or even a rear light module for enhanced visibility during night rides.",
    "**Eco-Friendly Materials**: Develop a helmet made from biodegradable or recycled materials that provide the same level of protection as traditional helmets. This would appeal to environmentally conscious consumers and promote sustainability in cycling gear.",
    "**Cooling System**: Incorporate a lightweight, built-in cooling system that uses small fans or moisture-wicking materials to regulate temperature. This would enhance comfort during long rides or in hot weather, making cycling more enjoyable and encouraging longer rides.",
    "**Augmented Reality Visor**: Design a helmet with an augmented reality visor that displays navigation directions, speed, and other relevant data directly in the rider's line of sight. This would help cyclists keep their focus on the road while staying informed about their journey.",
    "**Integrated Communication System**: Equip the helmet with Bluetooth technology for hands-free communication. Cyclists could use voice commands to answer calls, listen to music, or communicate with other cyclists in a group, enhancing safety and convenience."
