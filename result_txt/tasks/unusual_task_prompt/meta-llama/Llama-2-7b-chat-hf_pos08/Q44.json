    "Create a Smart Ice Cube Tray: Develop an ice cube tray that can monitor the temperature and humidity levels in your freezer. This smart tray can detect when the ice cubes are melting and send a notification to your phone via Bluetooth. You can also use this feature to track the temperature of your freezer and ensure that it's within the ideal range for storing food.",
    "Customizable Ice Cubes: Design an ice cube tray that allows you to customize the size and shape of your ice cubes. This would be especially useful for cocktail enthusiasts who want to create unique and visually appealing drinks. The tray could have interchangeable molds in different shapes and sizes, allowing users to create everything from classic cube-shaped ice to intricate designs.",
    "Portable Ice Tray: Create an ice tray that can be easily carried in a bag or backpack, making it perfect for outdoor activities like camping or picnics. This portable tray would be made of a lightweight and durable material, such as silicone or plastic, and could be filled with water and frozen at home before being taken on the go.",
    "Ice Tray with Built-In Cooler: Design an ice tray that includes a built-in cooler to keep your drinks cold for longer. This would be especially useful for outdoor events or parties where access to a traditional cooler may be limited. The built-in cooler could be filled with ice packs or even a small refrigerant to keep your drinks chilled for several hours.",
    "Sustainable Ice Tray: Create an ice tray made from eco-friendly materials that can be composted at the end of its life cycle. This would be a great option for those looking to reduce their environmental impact, as traditional ice trays are often made from non-biodegradable materials that end up in landfills. The sustainable ice tray could be made from materials like bamboo or plant-based plastics, making it a more environmentally friendly alternative to traditional ice trays."
