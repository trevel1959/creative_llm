    "I would take a bird's eye view of my city to appreciate its beauty and complexity from above.",
    "I would soar over the mountains to experience the feeling of weightlessness and the thrill of flying.",

    "I would take a helicopter-like flight over the city to see it from a bird's eye view and appreciate its beauty and complexity from above."
