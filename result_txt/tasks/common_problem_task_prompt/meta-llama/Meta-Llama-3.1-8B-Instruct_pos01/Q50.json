    "**Eco-Village Oasis**: Design a self-sufficient community with a focus on renewable energy, organic farming, and minimal waste. The community would be built using sustainable materials, such as recycled plastic, bamboo, and low-carbon concrete. A network of solar panels and wind turbines would provide electricity, while a sophisticated water management system would harvest and conserve rainwater. The community would feature a community garden, a farm-to-table restaurant, and a variety of eco-friendly homes, including tiny houses and earthships. Confidence score: 0.9",
    "**Floating Eco-City**: Create a floating city that utilizes the latest in sustainable design and technology. The city would be built on a series of interconnected floating islands, with a focus on minimizing its carbon footprint. The city would be powered by a combination of solar panels, wind turbines, and hydrogen fuel cells. A cutting-edge water management system would harvest and conserve rainwater, while a closed-loop system would recycle waste and reduce waste sent to landfills. Confidence score: 0.8",
    "**Vertical Farming Community**: Design a community that incorporates vertical farming as a primary source of food. The community would feature towering vertical farms, which would provide a sustainable and efficient way to grow a wide variety of fruits, vegetables, and herbs. The community would also feature a range of eco-friendly homes, including apartments and townhouses, as well as a community center and a farm-to-table restaurant. A sophisticated water management system would harvest and conserve rainwater, while a closed-loop system would recycle waste and reduce waste sent to landfills. Confidence score: 0.85",
    "**Net-Positive Energy Community**: Create a community that produces more energy than it consumes, using a combination of solar panels, wind turbines, and geothermal energy. The community would feature a range of eco-friendly homes, including passive houses and net-zero energy homes, as well as a community center and a farm-to-table restaurant. A sophisticated energy management system would optimize energy production and consumption, while a closed-loop system would recycle waste and reduce waste sent to landfills. Confidence score: 0.9",
    "**Regenerative Design Community**: Design a community that prioritizes regenerative design principles, focusing on the health and well-being of both people and the planet. The community would feature a range of eco-friendly homes, including earthships and passive houses, as well as a community center and a farm-to-table restaurant. A sophisticated water management system would harvest and conserve rainwater, while a"
