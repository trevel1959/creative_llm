    "**Innovative Pencil Sharpener Design for Ergonomics**: Develop a pencil sharpener that incorporates ergonomic principles. It could feature an adjustable grip to accommodate different hand sizes and reduce fatigue, or it might have a unique shape that encourages proper posture while using it. The design could also include a feature that allows for a more comfortable hold and reduces hand strain, like a built-in cushion or textured grip. This idea not only enhances user comfort but also potentially increases productivity by reducing physical discomfort.",
    "**Pencil Sharpener with Built-in Eraser**: Combine functionality by adding a retractable eraser inside the sharpener. This design would allow users to sharpen their pencils and erase mistakes all in one tool, eliminating the need for carrying separate erasers. It could be designed with a simple mechanism that extends the eraser when needed, ensuring easy access without taking up extra space in pencil cases or desks.",
    "**Portable, Rechargeable Pencil Sharpener**: Create a portable, rechargeable pencil sharpener that can be used anywhere, anytime. This product would be especially useful for students and professionals who travel frequently. It could come with a USB-C charging cable and an LED indicator to show the battery level. The compact size and lightweight design would make it easy to carry around, and its rechargeable feature would eliminate the need for disposable batteries.",
    "**Sustainable Pencil Sharpener Made from Recycled Materials**: Design a pencil sharpener made entirely from recycled materials, such as plastic bottles, cardboard, or reclaimed wood. This eco-friendly product would not only reduce waste but also appeal to environmentally conscious consumers. The design could incorporate unique features like solar panels for charging (if it's part of a larger sustainable stationery line) or a built-in compost bin for collecting shavings.",
    "**Pencil Sharpener with Digital Integration**: Develop a smart pencil sharpener that integrates technology, allowing users to track their pencil usage, manage their supplies, and receive notifications when they need to order replacements. This device could connect to a smartphone app via Bluetooth or Wi-Fi, providing data analytics on usage patterns and suggesting maintenance tips. Additionally, it might offer customization options, such as choosing different colors or designs for the sharpener itself, to cater to personal preferences."
