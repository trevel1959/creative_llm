    "**Island Hopper's Paradise**: I'd focus on finding a way to create a makeshift sailboat using materials from the island, such as palm fronds, vines, and driftwood. This would allow me to explore the surrounding waters, scavenge for food and supplies, and potentially find other survivors or signs of civilization. I'd also use my time on the island to learn about the local marine life, which could provide valuable resources and insights.",
    "**Island Innovator**: I'd use my time on the island to invent and create new tools and gadgets using the island's resources. For example, I could create a makeshift fishing net using woven fibers, or a solar still to purify water. I'd also experiment with creating a simple irrigation system to grow my own food and increase my chances of survival.",
    "**Island Forager**: I'd focus on foraging for food and other essential resources on the island. I'd learn about the local flora and fauna, identifying edible plants, fruits, and nuts, as well as animals that could provide a source of protein. I'd also collect rainwater, create a shelter using natural materials, and use my knowledge of the island's ecosystem to create a sustainable food source.",
    "**Island Artist**: I'd use my time on the island to express myself creatively, using the island's resources to create art, music, and other forms of self-expression. I'd collect seashells, rocks, and other natural materials to create sculptures, paintings, and other forms of art. I'd also use my knowledge of the island's sounds and rhythms to create music and songs that would help me stay positive and focused.",
    "**Island Scientist**: I'd use my time on the island to conduct scientific experiments and observations, studying the island's ecosystem, geology, and climate. I'd collect data on the island's temperature, humidity, and weather patterns, as well as the behavior and habitats of the island's wildlife. I'd also use my knowledge of chemistry and physics to create new materials and tools, and potentially discover new sources of energy and resources. [/INST] "
