    "**\"Sensor Overload\"**: The sheer number of sensors and cameras required for a self-driving car to function could lead to a \"sensor overload\" situation, where the system becomes overwhelmed and unable to process information accurately. This could result in decreased performance, increased errors, or even complete system failure.",
    "**\"Cybersecurity Conundrum\"**: Self-driving cars rely heavily on software and connectivity, making them vulnerable to cyber threats. Hackers could potentially gain control of the vehicle, putting passengers and other road users at risk. Ensuring the security of these systems is a significant challenge.",
    "**\"Liability Limbo\"**: As self-driving cars become more prevalent, the question of liability in the event of an accident will become increasingly complex. Who is responsible when a self-driving car is involved in a collision â€“ the manufacturer, the owner, or the software provider? This could lead to a plethora of lawsuits and disputes.",
    "**\"Social Stigma\"**: Self-driving cars may be perceived as a luxury item or a status symbol, leading to social stigma for those who cannot afford them. This could exacerbate existing social and economic inequalities, as those who cannot access these vehicles may be forced to rely on traditional public transportation or other forms of transportation that are less desirable.",
    "**\"Regulatory Red Tape\"**: The development and deployment of self-driving cars will require significant regulatory changes and updates. Governments and regulatory bodies will need to create new laws and guidelines to address the unique challenges and risks associated with these vehicles. However, this process can be slow and bureaucratic, hindering the adoption of self-driving cars."
