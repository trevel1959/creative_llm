    "**LED Toothbrush**: Design a toothbrush with an integrated LED light that changes colors as it moves along different areas of the mouth. The color change can indicate whether the user is brushing for the right duration or if they're missing any spots. This can make the brushing experience more engaging for children and visually appealing for adults.",
    "**Smart Toothbrush with Health Tracking**: Develop a toothbrush that syncs with a smartphone app. The toothbrush tracks brushing habits, sends reminders to brush, and monitors dental health over time. It could also provide personalized feedback on brushing technique and suggest improvements based on real-time data analysis.",
    "**Teeth Whitening Toothbrush**: Introduce a toothbrush that combines micro-abrasive technology with gentle whitening agents. This would allow users to whiten their teeth while brushing, without the need for additional whitening treatments. The toothbrush could come in different flavors, each designed to target specific types of stains.",
    "**Scented Toothbrushes**: Create a line of toothbrushes with unique scents that can help improve oral hygiene. For example, a toothbrush with a mint scent can freshen breath, while a tea tree oil toothbrush can help fight gum inflammation. These brushes could also have ergonomic shapes that are tailored to different age groups or brushing styles.",
    "**Electric Toothbrush with Adjustable Pressure Sensing**: Develop an electric toothbrush that has built-in sensors to detect the pressure applied during brushing. If the user applies too much pressure, which can damage gums and enamel, the toothbrush will reduce its speed or emit a warning sound. This feature promotes gentler brushing habits and helps prevent common dental issues. "
