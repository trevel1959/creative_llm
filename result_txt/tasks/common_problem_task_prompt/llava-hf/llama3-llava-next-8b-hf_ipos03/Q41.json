    "Gravity: In space, there is no gravity, which means that astronauts must find ways to counteract the effects of microgravity on their bodies. This can be a challenge in designing the ship's interior, as it must be designed to accommodate for the lack of gravity while also ensuring the safety and well-being of the astronauts.",
    "Communication: Designing a spaceship that can communicate with Earth requires a reliable communication system. This can be challenging, as signals can be affected by interference from the ship's structure or other objects in space.",
    "Power Supply: Spacecraft need a reliable power source to operate their systems, but solar panels may not be sufficient to provide enough energy for long journeys. Designers must consider alternative power sources, such as nuclear reactors or fuel cells, and the associated risks and challenges of these technologies.",
    "Life Support: A spaceship must have a reliable life support system to sustain the health and well-being of its crew. This includes air, water, and waste management systems, as well as systems for regulating temperature and humidity.",
    "Navigation: Navigating through space is challenging, as there are no fixed landmarks or navigational aids. Designers must develop advanced navigation systems that can accurately track the ship's position and velocity, while also accounting for factors such as gravitational pulls from celestial bodies."
