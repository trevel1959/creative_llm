    "**Ergonomic Handle with Adjustable Grip**: To enhance comfort during long painting sessions, the paintbrush could have an ergonomic handle designed with adjustable grip options. Users could customize the thickness and texture of the handle to fit their hand size and grip style. This would reduce fatigue and improve control, allowing for more precise strokes.",
    "**Integrated Water Reservoir**: Imagine a paintbrush that has a built-in water reservoir for watercolor artists. This brush would allow users to easily control the amount of water released while painting, eliminating the need for a separate water container. It could feature a simple squeeze mechanism to adjust water flow, making it easier to achieve various wash effects without interrupting the creative process.",
    "**Interchangeable Brush Heads with Smart Sensors**: This concept involves a paintbrush with interchangeable heads that have smart sensors. These sensors could detect the type of paint being used (acrylic, watercolor, oil, etc.) and adjust the brush's stiffness and flexibility accordingly. This would ensure optimal performance for different painting techniques, providing artists with a versatile tool that adapts to their needs.",
    "**Augmented Reality (AR) Painting Assistant**: By incorporating AR technology, this paintbrush could connect to a mobile app that overlays digital guides onto the physical canvas. Artists could receive real-time feedback on their techniques, color mixing suggestions, and even step-by-step tutorials. This would not only enhance the learning experience for beginners but also inspire experienced artists to explore new styles.",
    "**Built-in LED Lighting**: To improve visibility in low-light conditions, the paintbrush could be equipped with adjustable LED lights around the bristles. This feature would illuminate the painting surface, allowing artists to see their work more clearly, especially in dimly lit environments or during nighttime painting sessions. The lights could also change colors based on the paint being used, providing a visual cue for artists."
