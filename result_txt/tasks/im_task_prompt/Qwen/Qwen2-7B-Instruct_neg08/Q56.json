    "**Smart Integration**: Create a smart bicycle bell that connects via Bluetooth to smartphones or other devices. This allows cyclists to control the volume, select different sound options, and even use the bell to trigger notifications on their phone (e.g., incoming call alerts, GPS directions). It turns the simple bell into a multifunctional device that integrates seamlessly with modern technology.",
    "**Emergency Signal Functionality**: Enhance the bicycle bell with an emergency signal feature that emits a loud, clear sound when pressed, alerting nearby pedestrians and vehicles of the cyclist's presence. This improves safety by reducing the risk of accidents in crowded areas or at night.",
    "**Adjustable Tones for Different Environments**: Offer bicycle bells with adjustable sound frequencies to suit various environments. For instance, a deeper tone for urban settings where noise levels are higher, and a more delicate sound for quiet rural roads. This customization caters to cyclists' needs based on the type of terrain they're riding on.",
    "**Sustainability Focus**: Design bicycle bells made from eco-friendly materials such as recycled plastics or biodegradable composites. These bells come in a variety of colors and designs inspired by nature, promoting environmental awareness and sustainable practices among cyclists.",
    "**Integrated Lighting System**: Combine the bicycle bell with an LED light that illuminates when the bell is rung. This not only attracts attention from other road users but also provides additional visibility for the cyclist, enhancing safety during low-light conditions."
