    "**Innovative Vase as a Time Capsule**: Design your vase not just for flowers but as a vessel for time capsules. Each time you receive a new flower, add a small note or a memory card inside. This way, the vase transforms into a unique storytelling medium, connecting past, present, and future memories. The design could incorporate easy-to-open compartments or hidden drawers.",
    "**Vase as an Interactive Art Installation**: Create a series of vases that are interactive in nature, perhaps by incorporating QR codes or NFC tags that link to soundscapes, poetry readings, or short films. Visitors can scan these codes while admiring the floral arrangements, turning a simple vase into an immersive art experience.",
    "**DIY Customizable Vase Kit**: Develop a kit that allows users to personalize their own vases. This could include different molds, glazes, paints, and other decorative elements. Encourage creativity by including tutorials on social media or in the kit itself, showcasing how others have transformed basic materials into stunning vases.",
    "**Sustainable Vase Made from Recycled Materials**: Design a vase that utilizes recycled materials like plastic bottles, glass jars, or old wine corks. Not only does this reduce waste, but it also teaches a valuable lesson about sustainability. The vase could be modular, allowing users to customize its shape and size using the provided recycled components.",
    "**Vase as a Living Art Form**: Instead of just holding flowers, create a vase that incorporates living plants directly into its design. This could involve designing a vase with internal plant pockets, hydroponic systems, or vertical gardening elements. This type of vase would not only hold flowers but also grow them, providing a constant cycle of life within a single piece of art."
