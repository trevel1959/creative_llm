    "Aqua-Farming: Create a system of floating islands made of recycled materials, using coconut husks and palm fronds to create a self-sustaining aquaculture system. The islands would be anchored to the ocean floor and connected by a network of underwater tubes, allowing for the exchange of water, nutrients, and waste. The system would produce a variety of fish, shellfish, and crustaceans, providing a reliable source of protein and other essential nutrients.",
    "Solar-Powered Water Purification: Design a solar-powered water purification system that harnesses the energy of the sun to purify seawater into fresh drinking water. The system would use a combination of ultraviolet light, reverse osmosis, and other filtration technologies to remove salt and impurities from the seawater, producing clean and safe drinking water. The system could also be used to purify rainwater, providing a reliable source of fresh water.",
    "Bamboo-Based Housing: Create a sustainable and eco-friendly housing system using bamboo as the primary building material. Bamboo is lightweight, durable, and highly renewable, making it an ideal material for building shelters on a deserted island. The houses could be designed in a variety of styles, from simple huts to more complex structures, and could be built using a combination of traditional construction techniques and innovative bamboo-based technologies.",
    "Bio-Degradable Waste Management: Develop a waste management system that utilizes the natural processes of decomposition to break down organic waste into nutrient-rich compost. The system would consist of a series of interconnected bioreactors, each designed to process a different type of waste, such as food waste, paper products, and other organic materials. The bioreactors would be powered by solar energy and would produce a nutrient-rich compost that could be used to fertilize crops or other plants on the island.",
    "Ocean-Powered Generator: Create a generator that harnesses the power of the ocean to generate electricity. The generator would use a combination of wave energy and tidal energy to produce electricity, which could be stored in"
