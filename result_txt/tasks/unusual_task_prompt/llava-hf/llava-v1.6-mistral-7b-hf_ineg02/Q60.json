    "**Dry Cleaning**: Clothes hangers can be repurposed as a makeshift dry cleaning tool. By placing a wet garment on the hanger and placing it in a plastic bag with a little bit of dry cleaning solution, the hanger can be used to help absorb excess moisture from the fabric, reducing the need for a professional dry cleaning service.",
    "**Wireless Charging**: Some clothes hangers have a built-in coil of wire that can be used to create a simple charging station for electronic devices. By connecting the hanger to a power source and placing a device on the hanger, the coil of wire can act as an antenna, transmitting a signal that charges the device wirelessly.",
    "**Plant Support**: Clothes hangers can be used as a temporary support for plants that are being moved or rearranged. The hanger's wire can be wrapped around the stem of the plant, providing additional support and preventing the plant from bending or breaking.",
    "**Emergency Escape Tool**: In case of an emergency, a clothes hanger can be used as an improvised escape tool. By carefully unraveling the wire and attaching it to a window or door latch, the hanger can be used to open the latch from the outside, allowing for a quick escape.",
    "**Organizing Cables**: Clothes hangers can be used to help organize and manage cables and wires. By placing the hanger over a cable bundle and attaching the wires to the hanger's hooks, the hanger can be used to keep the cables organized and tangle-free."
