    "Nature's internal clock: Without birds, the natural rhythm of the environment could be used as an alarm clock. For instance, the sunrise could be used as a natural alarm clock, signaling the start of a new day. The changing tides, the breeze, or even the rustling of leaves could be used as subtle cues to wake up.",
    "Acoustic Alarm: The sounds of nature, such as the chirping of insects, the rustling of small animals, or the gentle hum of the wind, could be used to create an acoustic alarm. By recording and playing back these sounds at a set time each day, a person could wake up to a natural and soothing alarm.",
    "Light Therapy: The absence of birds could lead to a shift in the sleep-wake cycle. To compensate for this, a light therapy device could be used to simulate the morning sunlight, signaling the start of a new day. By exposing oneself to the light at a set time each day, the body's internal clock could be adjusted to mimic the natural light-dark cycle.",
    "Smell-based Alarm: The scent of certain plants or herbs could be used to create a unique and soothing alarm. For example, the aroma of lavender or vanilla could be used to signal the start of a new day. By placing a small amount of the scented substance in a diffuser or potpourri dish, the smell could fill the room at a set time each day, gently waking the sleeper.",
    "Personalized Morning Ritual: Without birds, a personalized morning ritual could be created to signal the start of a new day. This could involve a series of gentle stretches, meditation, or a short yoga routine. By incorporating a consistent and calming routine into one's morning, the absence of birds could be compensated for and the body's internal clock could be adjusted to mimic the natural light-dark cycle."
