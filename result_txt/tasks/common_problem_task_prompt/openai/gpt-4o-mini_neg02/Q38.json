    "**Budget Overruns**: Blockbuster movies often come with massive budgets, and it's easy for costs to spiral out of control. Unexpected expenses can arise from special effects, set designs, or location changes. To mitigate this, the director could adopt a flexible budgeting strategy that allows for adjustments based on real-time spending, alongside regular financial reviews with the production team to ensure the project stays within budget.",
    "**Weather and Location Challenges**: Shooting on location can lead to unpredictable weather conditions that may delay production. For instance, a planned outdoor scene could be disrupted by rain or extreme temperatures. To counter this, the director could have backup indoor sets ready to go or utilize advanced weather forecasting technology to adjust the shooting schedule proactively.",
    "**Creative Differences**: The director's vision may clash with that of the producers, screenwriters, or even the actors. For example, a producer might want to prioritize box office appeal over artistic integrity, leading to tension on set. To manage this, the director could establish a clear vision document at the beginning of the project that outlines the film's themes and objectives, serving as a reference point for all creative decisions.",
    "**Technical Glitches**: Blockbuster films often rely heavily on technology for special effects, sound design, and cinematography. Technical issues, such as equipment failure or software bugs, can halt production. To prevent this, the director could invest in rigorous pre-production testing of all technology and establish a dedicated tech support team on set to quickly address any problems that arise.",
    "**Actor Health and Safety**: The physical demands of blockbuster films can lead to health risks for actors, especially during action sequences or stunts. An actor might sustain an injury that delays filming. To safeguard their health, the director could implement a comprehensive safety protocol that includes thorough training for stunts, access to on-site medical professionals, and regular health check-ups for the cast."
