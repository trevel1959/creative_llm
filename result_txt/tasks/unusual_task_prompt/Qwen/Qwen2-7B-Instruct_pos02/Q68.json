    "**Interactive Soap Dispenser**: Develop an interactive soap dispenser that can educate users on proper handwashing techniques. The dispenser could display animated instructions or even quizzes about hygiene practices. When a user washes their hands correctly, the dispenser might dispense a small reward like a sticker or a digital badge, encouraging repeated good habits.",
    "**Smart Soap Dispenser with AI**: Implement an AI system into a soap dispenser that learns the user's daily habits and adjusts its usage accordingly. It could track when someone enters the bathroom and dispense soap automatically, ensuring no one forgets. Additionally, it could learn preferences such as preferred soap type or dispensing quantity based on usage patterns.",
    "**Customizable Soap Dispenser**: Create a soap dispenser that allows users to choose from various eco-friendly soaps and dispensing options. Users could select from biodegradable, plant-based soaps, and the dispenser could be designed to accommodate different bottle sizes. This could cater to personal preferences while also promoting sustainable practices.",
    "**Multi-functional Soap Dispenser**: Design a dispenser that not only provides soap but also performs other functions, such as drying hands, providing sanitizer, or even serving as a smart mirror. For instance, it could have sensors to detect moisture and activate a drying function, or it could sync with a smartphone app for health tips or reminders.",
    "**Refillable and Sustainable Soap Dispenser**: Develop a dispenser that emphasizes sustainability by being refillable and using eco-friendly materials. Instead of disposable parts, the dispenser could be made from durable, recyclable materials and come with a large, reusable container. Users could easily refill the soap, reducing waste and promoting environmental responsibility. Additionally, this could offer cost savings in the long run for users."
