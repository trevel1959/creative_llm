    "Create a rainwater harvesting system: One way to collect water if there was no more rain would be to install a rainwater harvesting system. This could involve installing a large container, such as a cistern, to collect rainwater from the roof of a building. The water could then be used for irrigation, washing, and other non-potable uses.",
    "Use a desalination plant: Another way to collect water if there was no more rain would be to use a desalination plant. This process involves removing salt and other minerals from seawater to make it potable. This could be a viable option if there was access to the ocean or a large body of saltwater.",
    "Extract water from the ground: If there was no more rain, another option for collecting water would be to extract it from the ground. This could involve drilling deep wells or using groundwater pumping systems to extract water from underground aquifers.",
    "Collect condensation: Condensation is water that forms on surfaces when the temperature and humidity are high. If there was no more rain, another way to collect water would be to set up a system to collect condensation. This could involve using a dehumidifier or setting up a condenser unit that collects water from the air.",
    "Use a greywater system: Greywater is the wastewater that comes from activities like showering, washing dishes, and laundry. If there was no more rain, another way to collect water would be to install a greywater system. This system would collect and treat greywater so that it could be used for irrigation and other non-potable uses."
