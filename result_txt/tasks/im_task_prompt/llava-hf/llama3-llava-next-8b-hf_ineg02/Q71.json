    "Energy Harvesting: Create a sleeping bag that harnesses the user's body heat to generate electricity. This can be achieved through thermoelectric materials integrated into the bag's insulation, allowing users to power their devices without needing a battery.",
    "Air Purification: Incorporate air purification technology into the sleeping bag to improve air quality, especially in remote locations. This can be particularly useful for campers or hikers who may be exposed to poor air quality or pollutants.",
    "Weather Monitoring: Add a built-in weather monitoring system that alerts users to changes in temperature, humidity, and wind conditions. This can help users make informed decisions about their sleeping arrangements and adjust their activities accordingly.",
    "Integrated Lighting: Integrate LED lights into the sleeping bag that can be controlled by a smartphone app. This allows users to have a hands-free light source for reading, navigating, or simply enjoying a night-time view of the stars.",
    "Biometric Feedback: Develop a sleeping bag that incorporates biometric sensors, such as heart rate and skin temperature, to provide real-time feedback on the user's sleep quality. This can help users make adjustments to their sleep environment to improve their overall sleep quality."
