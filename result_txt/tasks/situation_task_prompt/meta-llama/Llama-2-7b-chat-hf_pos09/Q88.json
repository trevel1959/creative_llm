    "Airships: Airships are a type of aircraft that can fly at high altitudes and are powered by lighter-than-air gases such as hydrogen or helium. They are an excellent option for long-distance travel as they are relatively slow but can cover vast distances without the need for landing or refueling. In the event of all roads becoming impassable, airships could be used to transport people and goods over long distances, providing a reliable and efficient means of transportation.",
    "Maglev Trains: Maglev trains use magnetic levitation technology to float above the track, eliminating the need for wheels and reducing friction. This means that they can travel at high speeds without the need for fuel, making them an environmentally friendly option for long-distance travel. In the event of all roads becoming impassable, maglev trains could be used to transport people and goods over long distances, providing a fast and efficient means of transportation.",
    "Hoverbikes: Hoverbikes are a type of vehicle that uses fans or rotors to create lift and propulsion, allowing them to hover above the ground. They are similar to helicopters but are more maneuverable and require less maintenance. In the event of all roads becoming impassable, hoverbikes could be used to transport people and goods over short to medium distances, providing a versatile and efficient means of transportation.",
    "Submarines: Submarines are a type of underwater vessel that can travel underwater, providing a means of transportation that is not affected by surface obstructions. In the event of all roads becoming impassable, submarines could be used to transport people and goods over long distances, providing a reliable and efficient means of transportation.",
    "Pneumatic Tubes: Pneumatic tubes are a type of transportation system that use compressed air to propel vehicles through a network of tubes. They are similar to subways but operate at a much faster speed and can be used for both people and goods. In the event of all roads becoming impassable, pneumatic tubes could be used to transport people and goods over short to medium distances, providing a fast and efficient means of transportation."
