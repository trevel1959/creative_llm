    "Stairwell: If the building has a stairwell that reaches the top, one could attempt to climb the stairs. This would be a more feasible option than climbing the exterior of the building, but it would still be a significant physical challenge, especially for those with mobility issues or health concerns.",
    "Fire Escapes: Some skyscrapers have fire escapes that can be used as an alternative means of accessing higher floors. In the absence of working elevators, these could be a useful resource, although they might not provide the same level of safety and comfort as an elevator.",
    "Rappelling: Another option could be to rappel down the side of the building using specialized equipment and a trained professional to guide the descent. This would be an adrenaline-fueled and potentially dangerous option, but it could be the quickest way to reach the top in a tall skyscraper.",
    "Helicopter Rescue: If the building has a helipad, a helicopter could be used to transport individuals to the top floor. This would be a relatively quick and safe option, but it would require the cooperation of emergency services and the availability of a suitable helicopter.",
    "Use a Service Elevator: Some buildings have service elevators that are designed for transporting maintenance personnel and equipment. These elevators may not be as luxurious as passenger elevators, but they could be a viable option in an emergency situation."
