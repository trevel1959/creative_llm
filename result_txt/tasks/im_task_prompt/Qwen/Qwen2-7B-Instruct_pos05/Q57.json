    "**Innovative Wireless Charging Mouse**: This idea combines the convenience of wireless technology with the practicality of charging. The mouse would feature a built-in rechargeable battery that can be charged wirelessly through any Qi-certified charging pad. The charging mechanism could be integrated into the mouse's base or even hidden in a stylish stand when not in use, ensuring it remains always charged and ready for use.",
    "**Intelligent Gesture-Controlled Mouse**: By incorporating motion sensors and advanced algorithms, this mouse could interpret hand gestures to perform specific actions, such as scrolling or clicking. For instance, waving the hand left or right could scroll down or up, while pinching fingers together could copy and paste text. This concept could enhance productivity by allowing users to control their computer more intuitively without needing to move their fingers over the mouse buttons.",
    "**Sustainability-Focused Biodegradable Mouse**: Designed using biodegradable materials, this mouse aims to reduce environmental impact. Made from natural fibers like bamboo or cornstarch, the product would decompose much faster than traditional plastic alternatives. Moreover, the design could include a recycling program where users can send back their used mice to be recycled, creating a closed-loop system that encourages sustainability.",
    "**Health-Oriented Ergonomic Mouse with Vibrational Feedback**: This mouse would prioritize user health and comfort. With features like adjustable weight settings, customizable grip shapes, and ergonomic curves, it would cater to different users' needs. Additionally, it could incorporate a feature that vibrates at regular intervals to remind users to take breaks and stretch their hands, promoting better posture and reducing strain.",
    "**Voice-Activated Smart Mouse**: Combining speech recognition technology, this mouse would allow users to control their computer through voice commands. Users could ask the mouse to perform tasks like opening applications, navigating web pages, or adjusting volume levels. This innovative feature would cater to individuals with disabilities or those who prefer hands-free interaction, making computing more accessible and inclusive."
