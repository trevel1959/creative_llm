    "**Smart Coat Rack with Integrated Technology**: Incorporate smart technology into the coat rack, such as a built-in Bluetooth speaker, charging ports for devices, and LED lights that can change color based on the time of day or mood. The rack could also feature a sensor that detects when a coat is hung or removed, providing reminders on a connected app about weather conditions, suggesting when to wear a coat or an umbrella based on the forecast.",
    "**Eco-Friendly, Upcycled Materials**: Design a coat rack using upcycled materials, such as reclaimed wood or repurposed metal. This approach not only gives the coat rack a unique aesthetic but also promotes sustainability. The design could include a story card that explains the materials used and the environmental impact of choosing upcycled products, adding a personal touch for the consumer.",
    "**Multi-Functional Furniture Piece**: Transform the coat rack into a multi-functional piece of furniture by integrating seating and storage. For example, the base could have a small bench with hidden compartments for shoes or bags, while the upper part remains a traditional coat rack. This would be especially useful in entryways where space is limited, combining functionality with style.",
    "**Artistic Display Rack**: Turn the coat rack into an artistic display piece by incorporating elements of sculpture or design. Each hook could be designed to resemble various artistic forms, such as branches, abstract shapes, or animals. This would not only serve a practical purpose but also act as a conversation starter and an eye-catching element in any room.",
    "**Personalized Name Tags or Hooks**: Allow users to personalize their coat rack with name tags or hooks that can be customized with initials, family names, or even fun graphics. This could be achieved through a simple engraving or a magnetic system where different tags can be swapped out. It adds a personal touch and helps keep track of whose coat belongs to whom, especially in shared spaces."
