    "Bartering System: In the absence of currency, people could rely on a bartering system, where goods and services are exchanged for other goods and services without using money. For example, a farmer could trade a bushel of wheat for a night's stay at an inn or a tailor could trade a suit for a haircut. This system would require a lot of negotiation and agreement between parties, but it would allow for the exchange of goods and services without the need for money. Confidence Score: 8/10",
    "Time Banks: Another option would be to establish time banks, where people contribute their time and skills to help others in exchange for time credits. For example, a person could spend an hour helping a neighbor with their gardening and receive an hour of time credits that they can use to get help with something else. Time banks would allow people to exchange services without the need for money. Confidence Score: 9/10",
    "Local Currencies: Communities could create their own local currencies that are used exclusively within their borders. These currencies could be based on the value of goods and services within the community and could be used to trade with other communities. For example, a community could create a currency called \"Green Bucks\" that can be used to buy goods and services within the community. Confidence Score: 8/10",
    "Digital Currencies: Another option would be to create digital currencies that are not tied to any government or central bank. These currencies could be used to trade goods and services online and could be based on a decentralized system, such as blockchain technology. For example, a digital currency called \"CoinX\" could be created and used to buy and sell goods and services online. Confidence Score: 7/10",
    "Resource-Based Economy: In a resource-based economy, goods and services are produced based on the availability of resources rather than the need for money. In this system, people would contribute their skills and time to produce goods and services based on the needs of the community, rather than for financial gain. This system would require a significant shift in societal values and would likely be more effective in a small-scale community setting. Confidence Score: 6/10"
