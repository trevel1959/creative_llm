    "**Candle Holder**: Use a wine glass as a unique candle holder. Place a small votive candle or tealight in the bowl of the glass. For an added touch, fill the stem with decorative stones, sand, or even colorful marbles to enhance the aesthetic. This creates a beautiful centerpiece for dining tables or special occasions.",
    "**Drink Chiller**: Fill a wine glass with ice and use it as a quick drink chiller. Place your favorite beverage can or bottle upside down in the glass. The ice will cool the drink rapidly while the glass catches any condensation, keeping your table tidy. This is especially handy for outdoor gatherings.",
    "**DIY Snow Globe**: Create a whimsical snow globe using a wine glass. Fill the bowl with a small figurine or decorative item, then add water and a few drops of glycerin (to help the “snow” fall slowly). Seal the top with a piece of cardboard or a decorative lid, and shake it to see your custom snow globe in action!",
    "**Herb Garden**: Use a wine glass to start a small herb garden on your kitchen windowsill. Fill the glass with potting soil and plant herbs like basil, mint, or parsley. The transparent glass allows you to monitor root growth and moisture levels, while the herbs are conveniently accessible for cooking.",
    "**Jewelry Display**: Turn a wine glass into an elegant jewelry display. Place the glass upside down and use the bowl as a stand for rings, earrings, or bracelets. The stem can hold necklaces or chains, preventing them from tangling. This not only organizes your jewelry but also adds a decorative touch to your dresser."
