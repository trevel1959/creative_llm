    "**Air Quality Monitor and Purifier**: Enhance air conditioners with built-in air quality sensors that monitor pollutants, humidity, and allergens in real-time. When poor air quality is detected, the unit could activate a purification mode that uses advanced filtration systems, such as HEPA filters or UV-C light, to clean the air while cooling it. This would create a healthier indoor environment.",
    "**Modular Design for Customization**: Create a modular air conditioning system that allows users to customize their units according to their specific needs. For example, users could add modules for enhanced dehumidification, air purification, or even smart lighting. This flexibility would cater to diverse living situations and preferences, making it a more versatile home appliance.",
    "**Integrated Smart Home Compatibility**: Develop air conditioners that seamlessly integrate with existing smart home ecosystems. This could include voice control through devices like Amazon Alexa or Google Assistant, remote monitoring via smartphone apps, and compatibility with other smart devices (like smart thermostats or security systems) to create a fully automated home environment.",
    "**Eco-Friendly Refrigerants**: Innovate the air conditioning system by using eco-friendly refrigerants that have a lower environmental impact compared to traditional refrigerants. This could involve researching natural refrigerants or developing new synthetic options that minimize ozone depletion and global warming potential, appealing to environmentally conscious consumers.",
    "**Self-Maintenance Features**: Incorporate self-diagnosis and maintenance alerts into air conditioners. The system could use sensors to detect when filters need cleaning or replacing, when coils need maintenance, or when performance is declining. This would empower users to take proactive measures, prolonging the lifespan of the unit and ensuring optimal performance."
