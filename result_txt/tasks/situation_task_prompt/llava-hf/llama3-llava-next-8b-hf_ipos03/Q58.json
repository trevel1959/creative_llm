    "Insect-controlled ecosystems: By maintaining a balance between predator and prey insects, ecosystems could be managed to control insect populations without the need for pesticides. This would require careful monitoring and intervention to ensure that the ecosystem remains stable and healthy.",
    "Insect traps: Insect traps could be designed that not only capture insects but also provide a means of controlling their populations. These traps could be equipped with microorganisms that specifically target the insects, ensuring that they are not harmful to other species.",
    "Insect-based bioproducts: The byproducts of insects could be used to create bioproducts, such as insect-based fertilizers, insect-based soap, or insect-based dyes. These bioproducts could provide an alternative to synthetic pesticides and other harmful chemicals.",
    "Insect-resistant crops: Breeding crops to be insect-resistant could be a long-term solution to controlling insect populations. This would require extensive research and development but could provide a sustainable method of managing pests without the need for pesticides.",
    "Insect-based pesticides: Insect-based pesticides could be developed that are specifically designed to target certain types of insects. These pesticides would be more environmentally friendly than traditional pesticides, as they would not harm other species."
