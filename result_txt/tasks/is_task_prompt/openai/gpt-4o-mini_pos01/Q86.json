    "Once in the heart of the jungle, there lived an elephant named Elara who had an unusual problem: she forgot everything! Each day, she would wake up with a blank slate. Her friends, a wise owl and a playful monkey, devised a plan. They created a memory tree, where they would hang colorful leaves, each representing a cherished memory. Every morning, Elara would visit the tree, marveling at the vibrant colors and laughing at the stories. Slowly, she learned that while she might forget, the love and laughter of her friends would always bring her back to joyful moments. ",
