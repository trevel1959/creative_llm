    "**Life Support System Complexity**: Designing a life support system that can provide breathable air, clean water, and proper temperature control is a significant challenge. Any failure in this system could lead to dire consequences for the crew. The complexity increases with the duration of the mission, as the system must be sustainable and capable of recycling resources efficiently.",
    "**Navigation and Communication Challenges**: In the vastness of space, accurate navigation is critical. Potential problems could arise from equipment malfunctions, solar flares disrupting signals, or software errors in the navigation systems. Communication with Earth may also be delayed or disrupted, leading to challenges in mission coordination and emergency responses.",
    "**Psychological Effects on Crew**: Long-duration missions can lead to psychological issues among crew members, such as isolation, anxiety, or cabin fever. Designing the spaceship to include recreational spaces, virtual reality environments, or social interaction tools can help mitigate these effects, but these solutions add complexity and require careful planning.",
    "**Power Generation and Storage**: The spaceship will need a reliable power source for its systems and equipment. Relying solely on solar panels could be problematic if the spaceship travels beyond the reach of the sun or encounters prolonged periods of darkness. Exploring alternative power sources, such as nuclear or advanced battery technology, poses its own set of challenges, including safety and efficiency.",
    "**Radiation Protection**: Space is filled with harmful radiation that can affect both the spaceship's systems and the crew's health. Designing effective shielding without adding excessive weight is a significant engineering challenge. Potential problems could arise if the shielding is inadequate, leading to increased cancer risk or damage to electronic equipment."
