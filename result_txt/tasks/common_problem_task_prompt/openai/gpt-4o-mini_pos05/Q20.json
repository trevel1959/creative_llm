    "**Cybersecurity Vulnerabilities**: Self-driving cars rely heavily on software and connectivity to function. This creates potential vulnerabilities to hacking and cyber-attacks. A malicious actor could take control of a vehicle, manipulate its functions, or even cause accidents. This raises concerns about the safety of passengers and pedestrians, as well as the privacy of users whose data may be collected and stored by the vehicle's systems.",
    "**Insurance and Liability Challenges**: The introduction of self-driving cars complicates the insurance landscape. If an accident occurs, determining liability becomes problematic. Is it the car manufacturer, the software developer, or the owner of the vehicle who is at fault? Current insurance models may not adequately cover these scenarios, leading to disputes and a potential increase in insurance premiums for self-driving car owners.",
    "**Regulatory and Legal Framework**: The legal framework surrounding self-driving cars is still evolving. Different regions may have varying laws regarding their operation, which can create confusion for owners who travel across state or national borders. Additionally, existing traffic laws may not account for the unique nature of autonomous vehicles, leading to potential legal challenges and a lack of clarity on the rights and responsibilities of self-driving car owners.",
    "**Maintenance and Technical Issues**: While self-driving cars are designed to be low-maintenance, they are still complex machines that require regular updates and servicing. Owners may face challenges in finding qualified technicians who understand the specific technology of self-driving vehicles. Additionally, software updates may need to be performed regularly to ensure safety and functionality, which could be inconvenient for owners.",
    "**Impact on Employment**: The widespread adoption of self-driving cars could disrupt various industries, particularly those reliant on driving jobs, such as trucking and taxi services. This could lead to significant job losses and economic shifts, creating societal issues related to unemployment and the need for retraining workers in other fields. Owners of self-driving cars may find themselves in a community facing economic challenges as a result of this technological shift."
