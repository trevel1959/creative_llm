    "**Community Land Trust (CLT) Initiative**: Establish a non-profit organization to acquire and hold land for the benefit of the community. The CLT would lease land to organizations providing affordable housing, ensuring that the land is used for the greater good. This model would allow for community input and control over land use, preventing speculation and gentrification.",
    "**Micro-Housing Village**: Create a network of small, efficient, and affordable housing units (approximately 100-200 sq. ft.) in a village-like setting. Each unit would be designed with a focus on sustainability, energy efficiency, and community engagement. Residents would have access to shared amenities, such as community kitchens, gardens, and social spaces, promoting a sense of community and social connections.",
    "**Mobile Housing Units (MHUs)**: Develop a fleet of modular, prefabricated housing units that can be easily assembled and disassembled. These MHUs would be designed to provide temporary or permanent housing solutions, addressing the needs of individuals and families experiencing homelessness. The units would be equipped with essential amenities, such as kitchenettes, bathrooms, and storage space.",
    "**Peer Support Housing (PSH) Program**: Implement a program that empowers individuals who have experienced homelessness to become peer support specialists. These individuals would provide guidance, support, and advocacy to their peers, helping them navigate the housing system and access essential services. The PSH program would focus on building trust, promoting self-advocacy, and fostering a sense of community among participants.",
    "**Affordable Housing Incubator**: Establish a platform that connects developers, architects, and designers with community members, social services providers, and local government agencies. The incubator would facilitate the creation of innovative, affordable housing projects that address the specific needs of the community. This collaborative approach would ensure that housing solutions are tailored to the unique challenges and opportunities of the city. [/INST] "
