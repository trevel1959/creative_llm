    "**Underwater Habitat Pods**: Develop specially designed, pressurized habitats that can be transported via cargo ships or submarines. These pods would provide a comfortable and safe environment for passengers to travel across the ocean, equipped with life support systems, air recycling, and communication devices. The pods would be designed to accommodate different types of travelers, from solo adventurers to families and groups, and could even be customized for specific needs, such as medical care or educational programs. To make the experience even more unique, the pods could be equipped with virtual reality technology, allowing passengers to explore the ocean floor or other destinations while they travel.",
    "**Space-Based Travel**: Utilize existing or newly developed space technology to transport people to other continents via space. This could involve launching passengers into orbit and then using a space station or a network of orbiting vehicles to transport them to their destination. The journey would be long, but passengers could enjoy stunning views of the Earth and experience weightlessness. To make the journey more comfortable, the spacecraft could be equipped with artificial gravity through rotating sections or gravitational simulation technology. Passengers could also participate in space-based activities, such as spacewalks, zero-gravity sports, or even asteroid mining.",
    "**Vacuum-Sealed Travel Bubbles**: Develop transparent, vacuum-sealed travel bubbles that can be transported via trucks or trains. These bubbles would provide a safe and comfortable environment for passengers to travel, protected from the outside environment. The bubbles could be designed to accommodate different types of travelers, from solo adventurers to families and groups, and could even be customized for specific needs, such as medical care or educational programs. To make the experience even more unique, the bubbles could be equipped with augmented reality technology, allowing passengers to interact with their surroundings in a virtual environment.",
    "**Maglev Capsules**: Utilize magnetic levitation technology to transport passengers in capsules at high speeds, potentially reaching speeds of over 300 km/h. The capsules would be designed to be comfortable and safe, with features such as air conditioning, entertainment systems, and communication devices. To make the experience even more unique, the capsules could be equipped with virtual reality technology, allowing passengers to explore their surroundings or destinations while they travel. The capsules could also be designed to accommodate different types of travelers, from solo adventurers to families and groups, and could even be customized for specific needs, such as medical care or educational programs.",
    "**Underwater Tunnel Network**: Develop a network of underwater tunnels that connect continents, allowing passengers to travel by high-speed train or capsule"
