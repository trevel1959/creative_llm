    "**Interactive Museum Exhibits**: Design immersive, interactive exhibits that allow visitors to engage with art, history, and science in a more hands-on and experiential way. For example, a museum could create a virtual reality experience where visitors can explore ancient civilizations, or a hands-on exhibit where visitors can build and test their own bridges.",
    "**Augmented Reality Storytelling**: Develop an app that uses augmented reality (AR) to bring stories to life. For example, a user could point their phone at a historical landmark and see a hologram of a person from that era telling their story, or a user could scan a book and see a 3D animation of the characters and settings.",
    "**Community-Driven Public Art**: Create a platform that allows community members to submit and vote on public art projects, giving them a sense of ownership and agency in the creative process. This could include murals, sculptures, or other forms of street art.",
    "**Immersive Theater Experiences**: Design immersive theater experiences that blur the lines between the audience and the performers. For example, a play could take place in a fully immersive environment, such as a haunted house or a futuristic city, where the audience is encouraged to participate and interact with the performers.",
    "**Virtual Reality Wellness Programs**: Develop VR programs that provide therapeutic benefits, such as reducing anxiety and stress, or improving sleep quality. For example, a program could transport users to a peaceful, natural environment, such as a beach or a forest, to help them relax and unwind. "
