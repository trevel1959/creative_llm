    "Biometric identification: If all forms of identification disappeared, we could use biometric identification as a way to prove who we are. Biometric identification uses unique physical characteristics such as fingerprints, facial recognition, and iris scans to identify individuals. This would require individuals to undergo biometric scans and store the data in a secure database.",
    "Digital signatures: Digital signatures could be used to prove identity. A digital signature is a unique code that is attached to a document or message and is used to verify the authenticity of the sender. This could be done by creating a digital signature and storing it in a secure database.",
    "Blockchain technology: Blockchain technology could be used to create a secure and tamper-proof system for verifying identity. Blockchain is a decentralized digital ledger that is used to record transactions. It could be used to create a digital identity that is secure and tamper-proof.",
    "DNA identification: DNA identification could be used to prove identity. This would require individuals to provide a sample of their DNA, which would be stored in a secure database. This would be a highly secure and accurate way to verify identity.",
    "Smart contracts: Smart contracts could be used to verify identity. Smart contracts are self-executing contracts with the terms of the agreement between buyer and seller being directly written into lines of code. This would require individuals to create a smart contract that verifies their identity and stores it in a secure database."
