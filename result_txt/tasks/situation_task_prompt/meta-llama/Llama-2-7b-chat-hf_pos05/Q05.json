    "Build a Solar-Powered Lighting System: Create a self-sustaining lighting system that harnesses the power of the sun through solar panels. These panels can be installed on rooftops or in gardens, and can provide a reliable source of light during the day. The system can be designed to store excess energy in batteries for use during cloudy days or at night.",
    "Mirror-Based Reflective Lighting: Develop a system that uses mirrors to reflect sunlight indoors during the day. This can be achieved by placing mirrors in strategic locations to reflect natural light from windows or skylights into areas with limited sunlight. The mirrors can be adjusted to redirect light to different areas as needed.",
    "Light-Emitting Plant Coatings: Develop a special coating for plants that absorbs sunlight during the day and emits a soft, diffused light at night. This coating can be applied to various types of plants, providing a natural and sustainable source of light. The coating can be designed to change colors or intensity based on the amount of sunlight it absorbs, creating a dynamic lighting effect.",
    "Cloud-Seeding Technology: Use cloud-seeding technology to induce artificial sunlight during the day. This involves injecting silver iodide or other substances into clouds to stimulate the formation of ice crystals, which can reflect sunlight back towards the Earth's surface. While this technology is still in its infancy, it has the potential to provide a sustainable and efficient source of light.",
    "Bioluminescent Lighting: Develop a lighting system that utilizes bioluminescent organisms, such as glowworms or fireflies, to provide light during the day. These organisms can be cultivated in controlled environments and used to create a soft, natural light that is both sustainable and aesthetically pleasing. The light can be adjusted by manipulating the environment of the bioluminescent organisms, creating a dynamic lighting effect."
