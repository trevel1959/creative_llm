    "Thermal Mass Storage: Utilize thermal mass materials like concrete, brick, or stone to absorb and release heat during the day. By incorporating these materials into building design, the temperature inside the building can be regulated through passive means. For example, during the night, the building can cool down by releasing heat stored in the thermal mass, and during the day, it can heat up by absorbing heat from the sun.",
    "Phase Change Materials: Use phase change materials like paraffin wax or salt hydrates to store thermal energy. These materials can absorb and release heat energy as they change phase, providing a consistent temperature. For instance, during the night, the phase change material can absorb heat from the building and release it during the day, maintaining a consistent temperature.",
    "Evaporative Cooling: Utilize evaporative cooling systems that use water to cool the air. By adding water to a cooling tower, the water can evaporate and cool the air, providing a natural cooling effect. This method can be more efficient than traditional air conditioning systems, as it uses the natural process of evaporation to cool the air.",
    "Green Roofs: Install green roofs with vegetation to provide insulation and shading. The vegetation can absorb heat during the day and release it at night, providing a consistent temperature inside the building. Additionally, the shading effect of the green roof can reduce the amount of heat that enters the building through windows, further regulating the temperature.",
    "Passive Solar Design: Design the building to take advantage of natural sunlight and heat. By strategically placing windows and shading devices, the building can be designed to capture and store heat during the day, providing a consistent temperature inside. This method can be particularly effective in regions with mild climates, as it can take advantage of the natural temperature fluctuations."
