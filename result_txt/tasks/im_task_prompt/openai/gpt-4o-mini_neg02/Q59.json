    "**Multi-Device Pairing**: Develop a feature that allows the Bluetooth speaker to connect and switch seamlessly between multiple devices. This could be achieved through a dedicated app that lets users manage connections, so they can easily switch from playing music from their phone to a podcast on their tablet without needing to disconnect and reconnect each time.",
    "**Visual Feedback Display**: Add a small LED display or a projection system that shows information about the currently playing track, including album art, artist name, and song lyrics. This could enhance user engagement and allow for a more interactive experience, especially during parties or gatherings where people might want to sing along.",
    "**Portable Power Bank Functionality**: Transform the Bluetooth speaker into a portable power bank that can charge other devices. By including a high-capacity battery and USB ports, users could charge their smartphones or tablets while enjoying music on the go, making it a practical solution for outdoor activities like camping or beach outings.",
    "**Modular Design**: Create a modular Bluetooth speaker system that allows users to customize their setup. For instance, they could add extra bass modules, surround sound components, or even light modules that sync with the music. This would not only enhance sound quality but also allow users to create a personalized audio-visual experience based on their preferences.",
    "**Voice-Controlled Personal Assistant**: Integrate a voice-activated personal assistant (like Alexa or Google Assistant) directly into the Bluetooth speaker. This would allow users to control music playback, answer questions, and manage smart home devices using voice commands, making the speaker a central hub for home automation and entertainment."
