    "Solar-Powered Candles: You could use solar-powered candles to light up a room at night. These candles use the sun's energy during the day to charge a battery, which powers the candle at night. This would provide a soft, warm light without the need for electricity or any other external power source.",
    "Glowing Plants: You could use plants that naturally glow in the dark to light up a room. For example, certain species of mushrooms, like the \"Glowing Mushroom,\" emit a soft, blue-green light when exposed to light. You could place these mushrooms around the room to create a soft, ambient light.",
    "Bioluminescent Bacteria: Bioluminescent bacteria are microorganisms that produce light on their own. You could use these bacteria to light up a room by creating a matrix of bacteria-infused surfaces, such as a wall or a ceiling. As the bacteria break down organic matter, they emit a soft, blue-green light.",
    "LED-Coated Fabrics: You could use fabrics coated with light-emitting diodes (LEDs) to light up a room. These fabrics would have a soft, diffuse light that would provide a warm, cozy ambiance. You could use them to create a canopy or a curtain, or even make a dress or a blanket with LED-coated fabric.",
    "Magnetic Lighting: You could use magnetic fields to create light in a room. By placing magnetic spheres or rods in a room, you could create a soft, diffuse light by using magnetic fields to align the light particles. This would provide a unique and futuristic lighting effect."
