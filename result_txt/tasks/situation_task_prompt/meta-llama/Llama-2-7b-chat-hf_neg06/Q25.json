    "Elevator-Powered Gliders: Develop a system of gliders that can be deployed from the elevator shafts to carry people to the top of the skyscraper. These gliders would be powered by the same electricity that runs the elevators, but would be designed to glide through the air instead of moving horizontally. The gliders could be made of lightweight materials, such as carbon fiber or aluminum, and would be equipped with small engines to provide additional thrust.",
    "Elevator-Powered Magnetic Levitation: Utilize the existing elevator mechanisms to create a magnetic levitation system that can transport people to the top of the skyscraper. The elevator cars would be equipped with magnetic coils that would create a magnetic field, allowing them to levitate above the shaft. This would eliminate the need for cables or pulleys, making the system more efficient and safer.",
    "Elevator-Powered Pneumatic System: Develop a pneumatic system that uses compressed air to propel people to the top of the skyscraper. The system would consist of a network of pipes and valves that would compress and release air to create a continuous flow of air that would propel the elevator cars. This system would be more energy-efficient than traditional elevators and could potentially reach higher speeds.",
    "Elevator-Powered Hovercraft: Design an elevator system that uses hovercraft technology to transport people to the top of the skyscraper. The elevator cars would be equipped with hovercraft fans that would create a cushion of air, allowing the cars to hover above the shaft. This system would be more energy-efficient than traditional elevators and could potentially reach higher speeds.",
    "Elevator-Powered Escalators: Create an escalator system that uses the existing elevator mechanisms to transport people to the top of the skyscraper. The escalators would be designed to wrap around the elevator shaft, with each step powered by the same electricity that runs the elevators. This system would be more energy-efficient than traditional escalators and could potentially reach higher heights."
