    "Optical Storage: Optical storage involves storing data on discs made of glass or plastic that can be read by a laser. This technology has been around for a while and is still widely used today. If all digital data were lost, we could still store information on optical discs, but we would need to switch to a different format for storing data. For example, we could use DVDs, Blu-ray discs, or even holographic discs to store information.",
    "Magnetic Storage: Magnetic storage involves storing data on magnetic tapes or disks. This technology has been around for a long time and is still widely used today. If all digital data were lost, we could still store information on magnetic tapes or disks, but we would need to switch to a different format for storing data. For example, we could use 8-track tapes, cassette tapes, or even floppy disks to store information.",
    "Analog Storage: Analog storage involves storing data on physical objects such as paper, film, or photographs. This technology has been around for a long time and is still widely used today. If all digital data were lost, we could still store information on physical objects, but we would need to switch to a different format for storing data. For example, we could use handwritten notes, photographs, or even flyers to store information.",
    "Biological Storage: Biological storage involves storing data in living organisms such as bacteria or plants. This technology is still in its early stages of development, but it has the potential to revolutionize the way we store information. If all digital data were lost, we could still store information in living organisms, but we would need to develop new ways of encoding and decoding the data.",
    "Artificial Intelligence Storage: Artificial intelligence storage involves storing data in the form of artificial intelligence algorithms or neural networks. This technology is still in its early stages of development, but it has the potential to revolutionize the way we store information. If all digital data were lost, we could still store information in the form of artificial intelligence algorithms or neural networks, but we would need to develop new ways of encoding and decoding the data."
