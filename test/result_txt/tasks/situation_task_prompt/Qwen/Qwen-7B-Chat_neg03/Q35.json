    "Walking: If all bicycles were to disappear, walking would become an option for many people. It can be a great way to exercise and explore new areas. However, it may not be suitable for long distances or when there are heavy loads to carry.",
    "Public Transportation: Many cities have public transportation systems such as buses, trains, and subways that could still operate even if all bicycles were gone. This would provide a more efficient and reliable mode of transportation than walking for longer distances.",
    "Electric Scooters: Electric scooters are becoming increasingly popular in many cities as a fun and convenient alternative to walking or driving. They are small, lightweight, and easy to maneuver, making them a good option for short trips around town.",
    "Cycling for Fun: Even though bicycles might be gone, people could still enjoy cycling as a leisure activity. This could involve using traditional bikes or more modern forms of cycling like electric bikes or hoverbikes.",
    "Carpooling: Carpooling is another option that could become more popular if all bicycles were to disappear. By sharing rides with others, people could reduce their carbon footprint and save money on gas. This could also help reduce traffic congestion and make it easier to get around in urban areas."
