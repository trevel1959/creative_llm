    "**Multi-Functional Wine Opener with Built-in Aerator**: Design a wine opener that not only corkscrews but also includes a built-in aerator. After opening the bottle, the wine can be poured directly through the aerator, which enhances the flavor and aroma of the wine. This would streamline the process and ensure that wine drinkers enjoy the full potential of their wine right after opening.",
    "**Ergonomic Wine Opener with Adjustable Grip**: Create a wine opener with an adjustable grip that conforms to the user's hand size. This could include a soft-touch material that provides comfort and prevents slipping. Additionally, it could have a twist mechanism that allows users to easily adjust the grip to their preferred width, making it accessible for those with limited hand strength or dexterity.",
    "**Wine Opener with Built-in LED Light**: Introduce a wine opener equipped with a small LED light that illuminates the cork and bottle neck when in use. This would be especially useful in low-light environments, such as restaurants or at home during a dinner party. The light could be activated with a simple switch, ensuring that users can easily see what theyâ€™re doing without spilling or damaging the cork.",
    "**Self-Extracting Wine Opener**: Invent a wine opener that automatically extracts the cork once inserted into the bottle. This could be achieved with a small motor that senses the cork and gently pulls it out without any manual twisting. This would be particularly beneficial for individuals with limited hand strength or those who struggle with traditional corkscrews.",
    "**Wine Opener with Reusable Corkscrew**: Develop a wine opener that comes with a reusable corkscrew, designed to fit snugly into various bottle sizes. This corkscrew could be made from eco-friendly materials and would allow users to reseal unfinished bottles without compromising the wine's quality. The design could include a simple locking mechanism that keeps the cork secure until the next use."
