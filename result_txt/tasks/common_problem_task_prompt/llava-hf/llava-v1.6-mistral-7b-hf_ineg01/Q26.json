    "**Avalanches and crevasse risks**: One of the most dangerous risks when climbing Mount Everest is avalanches and the risk of falling into crevasses. The mountain's unstable terrain and snow conditions can lead to sudden avalanches and hidden crevasses that climbers may not recognize. It's critical for climbers to have avalanche training, use proper equipment such as beacons, and practice safe climbing techniques to minimize these risks.",
    "**Weather Conditions**: Everest's weather conditions are notoriously unpredictable. Sudden storms, strong winds, and extreme cold can make the climb far more difficult, even deadly. It's essential for climbers to monitor weather forecasts, carry appropriate clothing and equipment, and have a plan for dealing with unexpected weather changes.",
    "**Physical Fitness and Fatigue**: Climbing Mount Everest is a highly demanding activity, requiring a high level of physical fitness. Climbers need to be in excellent physical shape to cope with the exertion of carrying a heavy backpack, crossing steep ice sections, and contending with the extreme cold. Fatigue can lead to mistakes, increase the risk of injury, and reduce the chances of reaching the summit.",
    "**Navigation Challenges**: Mount Everest is a vast, remote mountain with a complex maze of paths and routes. Getting lost can occur if the climber is not well-acclimatized, has poor route-finding skills, or is navigating unfamiliar terrain. It's crucial for climbers to have a well-planned route, carry navigational tools like GPS devices, maps, and compasses, and be familiar with the mountain's terrain and conditions.",
    "**Supply and Resource Management**: Proper planning and management of resources like clothing, food, water, fuel, and oxygen are essential for a successful ascent. There are instances when the supply chain can be disrupted due to weather conditions, delays when waiting for permits, or unexpected terrain changes. Climbers should have contingency plans for managing resources during unforeseen challenges."
