    "The Woolly Mammoth: This idea is based on the fact that woolly mammoths were well adapted to cold climates and had thick fur coats. By bringing them back to life, we could potentially use them for environmental conservation efforts in areas that are experiencing climate change. Additionally, their meat could be used as a source of food, and their hides could be used to make clothing or other products.",
    "The Tasmanian Tiger: This idea is based on the fact that the Tasmanian tiger was a large carnivorous marsupial that lived in Australia until the late 20th century. Bringing it back to life could help protect endangered species in the area, as it would provide a natural predator control mechanism. Additionally, its meat could be used as a source of food, and its fur could be used to make clothing or other products.",
    "The Dodo Bird: This idea is based on the fact that the dodo bird was a flightless bird that lived on the island of Mauritius until the early 17th century. Bringing it back to life could help restore biodiversity to the island, which has suffered greatly from human activity. Additionally, its meat could be used as a source of food, and its feathers could be used to make clothing or other products.",
    "The Pyrenean Ibex: This idea is based on the fact that the pyrenean ibex was a mountain goat that lived in the Pyrenees mountains until the mid-20th century. Bringing it back to life could help protect endangered species in the area, as it would provide a natural habitat for them. Additionally, its meat could be used as a source of food, and its fur could be used to make clothing or other products.",
    "The Giant Otter: This idea is based on the fact that giant otters are large, powerful aquatic mammals that live in South America. Bringing them back to life could help protect endangered species in the area, as they would provide a natural habitat for them. Additionally, their meat could be used as a source of food, and their pelts could be used to make clothing or other products."
