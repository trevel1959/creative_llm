    "**Biodegradable Containers**: Develop and promote the use of biodegradable containers made from plant-based materials like cornstarch or cellulose. These can be used for storing food, disposing of leftovers, and even as makeshift garbage bags. The biodegradable nature ensures that waste decomposes naturally without harming the environment.",
    "**Composting Systems**: Encourage the installation of composting systems in households and public spaces. Composting transforms organic waste into nutrient-rich soil, reducing the amount of waste sent to landfills and enriching local gardens and green spaces.",
    "**Digital Waste Management**: Create an app that allows users to virtually dispose of their waste. Users can scan a barcode on products they wish to recycle or dispose of, which then sends the information to a centralized system. This system could direct the user to recycling centers, donation sites, or other disposal options nearby.",
    "**Wearable Waste Collectors**: Design and manufacture wearable devices that collect waste while being worn. For example, shoes could have compartments for collecting small items like batteries or cigarette butts, while clothing could be made from fabric that attracts and traps pollutants.",
    "**Innovative Public Recycling Stations**: Develop new types of public recycling stations that are more user-friendly, interactive, and visually appealing. These could include touchless systems, smart bins that sort waste automatically, or stations that provide rewards (like discounts or points) for proper waste disposal. This encourages community participation and education about recycling practices."
