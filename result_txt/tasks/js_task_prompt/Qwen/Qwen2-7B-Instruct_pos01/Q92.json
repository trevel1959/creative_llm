    "**Bioluminescent Planets**: Each planet in the solar system would be bioluminescent, emitting different colors based on their composition and environmental conditions. This would not only make each planet visually stunning but also provide a unique source of light in space. Earth would emit a soft blue glow, while Mars might have a red hue, and Jupiter could shine with a bright green color. The confidence score for this idea is 0.8.",
    "**Dynamic Orbital Paths**: Instead of fixed orbits, each planet would have an adjustable orbital path that changes over time, creating a dynamic and ever-evolving solar system. This could lead to interesting phenomena such as planets temporarily entering the sun's orbit or swapping places with other planets. The confidence score for this idea is 0.7.",
    "**Artificial Moons**: All planets would have artificial moons created by advanced civilizations. These moons would not only provide additional habitable areas but also serve as platforms for scientific research, mining, and even as bases for interstellar travel. The confidence score for this idea is 0.9.",
    "**Interconnected Planetary Systems**: Each planet would be connected to its neighbors via transparent, high-speed transportation tunnels. This would allow for instant travel across the solar system, making exploration and communication much more efficient. The confidence score for this idea is 0.6.",
    "**Magnetic Field Reconfiguration**: The magnetic fields of all planets would be manipulated to create a protective barrier around each planet, deflecting cosmic rays and other harmful space particles. Additionally, these fields could be used to generate renewable energy, powering the entire solar system. The confidence score for this idea is 0.7."
