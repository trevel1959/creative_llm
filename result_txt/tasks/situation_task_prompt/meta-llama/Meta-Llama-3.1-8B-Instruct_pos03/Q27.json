    "**Solar Window Coatings**: Develop and install a specialized window coating that can harness and store solar energy during the day. This energy can then be released at night to warm the space, or during the day to cool it, depending on the temperature outside. The coating would use thermochromic materials that change color in response to temperature changes, allowing it to absorb or reflect sunlight accordingly. This technology would require minimal maintenance and would be a cost-effective solution for regulating indoor temperature.",
    "**Phase Change Materials (PCMs)**: Utilize PCMs, which are materials that absorb and release heat energy as they change phase from solid to liquid or vice versa. These materials can be integrated into building insulation, furniture, or even clothing to maintain a stable indoor temperature. PCMs can be designed to release heat when the temperature drops, keeping the space warm, and absorb heat when it's too hot, keeping the space cool. This technology would be particularly effective in areas with moderate temperatures.",
    "**Evaporative Cooling Systems**: Implement a network of evaporative cooling systems, which use water to cool the air through evaporation. These systems would work by drawing in hot air, passing it through a wetted medium, and then releasing the cooled air back into the space. This technology would be ideal for dry climates and could be powered by renewable energy sources.",
    "**Thermal Energy Storage (TES) Systems**: Develop and integrate TES systems, which store thermal energy in the form of molten salt or other phase-change materials. These systems would capture excess heat or cold during off-peak hours and release it when needed, providing a stable indoor temperature. TES systems would be particularly effective in areas with significant temperature fluctuations.",
    "**Biophilic Architecture**: Design buildings with biophilic architecture, which incorporates natural elements and principles to regulate indoor temperature. This could include features such as: \t* Green roofs or walls to provide insulation and reduce heat gain."
