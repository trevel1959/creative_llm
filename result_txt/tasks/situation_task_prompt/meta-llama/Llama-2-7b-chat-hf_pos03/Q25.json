    "Elevator Repair Drones: Deploy a fleet of small drones equipped with repair tools and spare parts to fix the elevators. These drones could be launched from a nearby rooftop or via a pulley system. Once the elevators are fixed, the drones could return to their charging station to recharge and be ready for the next emergency.",
    "Magnetic Levitation: Install a magnetic levitation system that would allow people to float up the skyscraper using magnetic fields. This technology is already being used in some elevators, and it could be scaled up for a skyscraper. The magnetic fields would suspend people and objects in mid-air, allowing them to move up the building without the need for traditional elevators.",
    "Cable Car System: Install a cable car system that would run along the exterior of the skyscraper. The cable car would be pulled by a motorized pulley system, allowing people to ride up the building. This system would be similar to the ones used in San Francisco, but on a much larger scale.",
    "Escalator Ropes: Install long, spiral escalators that would wrap around the skyscraper. These escalators would be powered by electric motors and would allow people to climb the building without the need for elevators. The spiral design would provide a unique and exciting experience for those climbing the skyscraper.",
    "Personal Rocket Packs: Provide each person with a personal rocket pack that would allow them to propel themselves up the skyscraper. These rocket packs would use a combination of oxygen and fuel to generate thrust, providing a quick and efficient way to reach the top of the building. The rocket packs could be recharged at the bottom of the skyscraper for reuse."
