    "**The Self-Sustaining Space Suit**: Design a space suit that not only protects the wearer from harsh space conditions but also generates its own power, air, and water. The suit could be equipped with a miniature solar panel, a CO2-absorbing membrane, and a condenser to collect and recycle water vapor from the wearer's breath. This innovative suit would allow astronauts to explore space for extended periods without the need for resupply missions.",
    "**Smart Contact Lenses**: Develop contact lenses with built-in microchips that can monitor vital signs, provide virtual displays, and even offer augmented reality experiences. These lenses could help people with diabetes track their blood sugar levels, athletes monitor their performance metrics, and individuals with visual impairments navigate through their surroundings with ease.",
    "**The Personal Atmospheric Water Harvester**: Create a device that can extract clean drinking water from the air, even in arid environments. This device would use advanced nanotechnology to condense and filter water vapor, making it possible for people to access clean drinking water anywhere, anytime.",
    "**The Shape-Shifting Bike**: Design a bike that can change its shape and configuration to adapt to different riding styles, terrain, and weather conditions. This bike could have a modular frame, adjustable geometry, and advanced suspension systems to provide a smooth ride on various surfaces.",
    "**The Bio-Inspired Soundproofing Material**: Develop a soundproofing material that mimics the properties of the natural world, such as the acoustic insulation of a beehive or the sound-absorbing qualities of a forest. This material could be used to create quiet, peaceful spaces in urban environments, reducing noise pollution and improving overall well-being. [/INST] [/INST] "
