    "**Innovative Wheelchair Design for Improved Comfort and Mobility:** Design a wheelchair that incorporates advanced materials and technology to enhance comfort and mobility. The wheelchair could have a cushioned seat made from memory foam, adjustable lumbar support, and shock absorbers in the wheels. It might also include sensors that detect changes in terrain and automatically adjust the wheel resistance accordingly. This design would be especially beneficial for individuals who spend long hours in their wheelchairs, potentially reducing fatigue and discomfort.",
    "**Smart Wheelchair Navigation System:** Develop a smart wheelchair equipped with AI and sensors that can navigate autonomously through various environments. The system could use GPS, LiDAR, and cameras to map out obstacles and plan the most efficient routes. Additionally, it could learn the user's preferences over time, such as preferred speeds or routes, to provide a more personalized experience. This would greatly improve independence for wheelchair users, especially those with limited mobility or vision.",
    "**Customizable Wheelchair Accessories for Personalized Functionality:** Create a line of customizable accessories that attach to standard wheelchairs, allowing users to tailor their chairs to meet specific needs. These accessories could include attachments for various tasks, such as cooking, reading, or working on a computer. For example, a magnetic board for jotting down notes, a holder for a tablet or e-reader, or an integrated tray for tools or food. This approach would empower wheelchair users to adapt their equipment to their lifestyle, enhancing their quality of life.",
    "**Ergonomic Wheelchair Workstation:** Design a workstation that integrates seamlessly into a wheelchair, providing a comfortable and functional workspace for users. The workstation could feature an adjustable desk surface, ergonomic chair supports, and integrated lighting. Additionally, it could include a charging station for devices and a small storage compartment for essential items. This setup would be ideal for professionals who need to work while mobile, promoting productivity and efficiency.",
    "**Accessible Fitness Equipment for Wheelchair Users:** Develop a series of fitness equipment specifically designed for wheelchair users, ensuring they can perform exercises safely and effectively. This could include adapted versions of traditional gym equipment, such as leg press machines or rowing machines, as well as new inventions like a wheelchair-friendly elliptical trainer or a stationary bike with adjustable resistance. By offering accessible fitness options, we can encourage wheelchair users to maintain their health and fitness, improving overall well-being."
