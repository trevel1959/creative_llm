    "**DIY Humidifier**: Modify a tissue box to create a simple yet effective humidifier for your room or office. Use a small water reservoir inside the box (you can use a plastic bottle cut in half) and add a small fan or an air pump on top. As the fan blows air through the box, it picks up moisture from the water reservoir and disperses it into the air, increasing humidity levels.",
    "**DIY Desk Organizer**: Transform a tissue box into a multi-functional desk organizer. Cut off the top part of the box, leaving only the bottom for stability. Add dividers made from cardboard or paper towel rolls to separate the space into compartments for pens, pencils, clips, and other small office supplies. The top of the box can serve as a convenient paper tray.",
    "**DIY Air Freshener Dispenser**: Fill the tissue box with scented oil-soaked cotton balls or use a few drops of essential oil directly on the tissue paper lining the inside of the box. Place the box near your bed, sofa, or in a closet for a subtle, pleasant scent that will freshen up the area without overpowering the senses.",
    "**DIY Plant Stand**: Cut the top of the tissue box and place it upside down over a potted plant. This creates a simple but stylish planter stand. You can also decorate the stand with paint or fabric to match your interior design. This is especially useful for smaller plants or for displaying indoor herbs.",
    "**DIY Mini Speaker Stand**: Attach a small speaker to the bottom of the tissue box using double-sided tape or hot glue. This can be a great DIY project if you want to elevate your mini speakers for better sound projection or just need a place to store them when not in use. It's also suitable for small Bluetooth speakers or other compact audio devices."
