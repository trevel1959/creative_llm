    "Pedal-powered vehicles: With all roads disappearing, people could turn to pedal-powered vehicles like bicycles, tricycles, or even velo-buses to move around the town or city. These eco-friendly vehicles would not only provide a sustainable mode of transportation but also help reduce air pollution. Additionally, they could be equipped with specialized cargo holders or trailers to carry goods and supplies.",
    "Waterways: Tapping into the town or city's waterways, such as rivers, lakes, or canals, could become the primary mode of transportation. People could use kayaks, canoes, or even small boats to navigate through the waterways, connecting different parts of the town or city. This would not only provide an alternative to road travel but also create new opportunities for recreation and tourism.",
    "Personal air vehicles: With the absence of roads, individuals could turn to personal air vehicles like hoverbikes, jetpacks, or even flying cars to travel around the town or city. These vehicles would provide a faster and more efficient means of transportation, especially for longer distances. However, safety protocols and regulations would need to be put in place to ensure safe flight operations.",
    "Skywalks: Investing in skywalks or elevated walkways could become a viable solution for moving around the town or city. These elevated pathways could be built above existing buildings, connecting different parts of the town or city, and providing a safe and secure way to traverse the area. Skywalks could also be designed with amenities like shops, restaurants, or parks, making them more than just a means of transportation.",
    "Vertical farming: With all roads disappearing, the town or city could adopt vertical farming techniques to grow food and other essential crops. This would involve constructing towering vertical farms that use hydroponics, aeroponics, or other forms of sustainable agriculture to cultivate crops. Not only would this provide a reliable source of food, but it could also create new job opportunities and help reduce the carbon footprint of the town or city."
