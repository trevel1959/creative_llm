    "**Habitat Maintenance and Enrichment**: Creating and maintaining appropriate habitats for the animals is crucial. Problems may arise if the habitats are not adequately designed to meet the animals' needs. For instance, if an enclosure lacks sufficient space or natural elements, it could lead to stress or behavioral issues in the animals. Regular assessments and updates to habitats are necessary to ensure they mimic the animals' natural environments and provide enrichment opportunities, such as climbing structures for primates or water features for aquatic species.",
    "**Visitor Safety and Engagement**: Ensuring the safety of visitors while providing an engaging experience can be a delicate balance. Issues could occur if barriers between animals and guests are insufficient, leading to potential accidents. Moreover, if the zoo fails to create engaging educational programs or interactive exhibits, visitors may leave feeling unsatisfied, impacting attendance and revenue. Developing a robust visitor engagement strategy that includes educational talks, animal encounters, and guided tours can help mitigate these issues.",
    "**Staff Training and Retention**: The success of a zoo heavily relies on its staff, from animal caretakers to educators. A problem may arise if staff are not adequately trained in animal care or visitor interaction, leading to safety concerns or poor animal welfare. Additionally, high turnover rates can disrupt operations and the continuity of care for the animals. Implementing ongoing training programs and creating a supportive work environment can help retain skilled staff and ensure high standards of care.",
    "**Funding and Financial Management**: Running a zoo can be expensive, and financial instability can pose significant challenges. Problems may include fluctuating attendance due to seasonal variations or economic downturns, leading to budget shortfalls. This can impact everything from animal care to maintenance of facilities. To address this, the zoo could diversify its revenue streams through membership programs, special events, and partnerships with local businesses, ensuring a more stable financial foundation.",
    "**Conservation and Ethical Considerations**: As public awareness of animal conservation grows, zoos face challenges in aligning their practices with ethical standards. Issues may arise if the zoo is perceived as not contributing to conservation efforts or if it houses animals in conditions that do not prioritize their welfare. Establishing clear conservation goals, participating in breeding programs for endangered species, and promoting educational initiatives can enhance the zoo's reputation and commitment to ethical practices."
