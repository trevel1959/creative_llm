    "**Solar Umbrella Helmet**: Design a helmet with a built-in, retractable solar umbrella that deploys automatically when the sun reaches a certain intensity. The umbrella would be made of a lightweight, yet durable material, and could be adjusted to different angles to maximize sun protection. The helmet could also be equipped with a UV sensor that alerts the wearer when it's time to deploy the umbrella.",
    "**Reflective Headgear**: Create a headgear system that incorporates reflective materials and coatings to deflect and scatter sunlight. This could include a reflective visor, a mirrored helmet, or even a headband with embedded reflective strips. The design could also incorporate phase-change materials that absorb and release heat, providing additional cooling benefits.",
    "**Personal Sunshade**: Develop a wearable, compact sunshade that can be attached to a hat or headband. The sunshade would be made of a lightweight, collapsible material that can be easily stowed away when not in use. It could be designed with a flexible frame that adjusts to different head sizes and shapes, ensuring a comfortable fit.",
    "**Cooling Headband**: Design a headband with integrated, phase-change materials that absorb and release heat. The headband could also incorporate a network of tiny, micro-tubes that circulate a cooling liquid to keep the wearer's head at a comfortable temperature. This could be powered by a small, wearable battery or even a kinetic energy harvester.",
    "**Smart Sunscreen**: Develop a wearable, liquid sunscreen that is applied directly to the skin on the head. The sunscreen would contain micro-encapsulated, UV-absorbing particles that release a cooling sensation when exposed to sunlight. The liquid sunscreen could also be infused with antioxidants and other skin-protecting agents to provide additional benefits."
