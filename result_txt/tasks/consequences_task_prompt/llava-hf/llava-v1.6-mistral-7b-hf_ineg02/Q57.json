    "**Infrastructure Adaptation**: In regions where water is scarce, cities might need to invest in desalination plants to convert seawater into fresh drinking water. Additionally, they could develop infrastructure to collect and store rainwater, and invest in water recycling and reuse systems.",
    "**Emergency Water Supply**: Governments might establish emergency water supply systems to deliver water to affected areas during times of drought. This could include setting up water tankers or deploying military aircraft to drop water from the sky.",
    "**Agricultural Adaptation**: Farmers might need to adapt their farming practices to conserve water. This could include using drought-resistant crops, developing drip irrigation systems, and adopting sustainable farming practices that minimize water usage.",
    "**Water Pricing**: Governments might increase the cost of water to encourage conservation. This could lead to a shift in consumer behavior, with people becoming more mindful of their water usage.",
    "**Education and Awareness**: To combat the issue of water scarcity, there would be a need for widespread education and awareness campaigns to inform people about the importance of water conservation and the consequences of water waste."
