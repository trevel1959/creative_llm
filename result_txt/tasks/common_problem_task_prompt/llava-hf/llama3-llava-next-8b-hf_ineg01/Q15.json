    "Inadequate water supply: Another potential problem is inadequate water supply. Gardens require consistent and sufficient watering to support healthy plant growth. Gardeners can install a drip hose system, use a rain barrel to collect rainwater, or install a well to provide a reliable water source.",
    "Pest infestations: Pests can be a significant problem for gardeners, as they can damage plants, spread diseases, and reduce crop yields. To prevent or control pest infestations, gardeners can use natural pest control methods such as introducing beneficial insects, using organic pesticides, or using physical barriers.",
    "Weeds: Weeds can compete with plants for water, nutrients, and light, reducing the overall health and productivity of the garden. Gardeners can use a combination of physical and chemical methods to control weeds, such as mulching, using pre-emergent herbicides, or using manual weeding tools.",
    "Diseases: Plant diseases can be a significant threat to gardeners, as they can spread quickly and cause widespread damage. Gardeners can use a combination of physical and chemical methods to control diseases, such as removing infected plant parts, using fungicides, or practicing good sanitation.",
    "Poor drainage: Poor drainage can lead to waterlogged soil, which can damage plants and reduce crop yields. Gardeners can improve drainage by installing a French drain, using raised beds, or incorporating organic materials such as straw or compost."
