    "**Liability and Insurance Issues**: Determining liability in the event of an accident involving a self-driving car can be complex. If a self-driving car is involved in a collision, questions arise about whether the manufacturer, software developer, or the owner is at fault. This ambiguity can lead to disputes over insurance claims and could necessitate new insurance models tailored specifically for autonomous vehicles. Developing clear legal frameworks and insurance policies will be essential to navigate these challenges.",
    "**Ethical Dilemmas in Decision-Making**: Self-driving cars may face situations where they must make split-second decisions in emergencies, such as choosing between hitting a pedestrian or swerving into oncoming traffic. These ethical dilemmas raise questions about how the car's algorithms are programmed to prioritize lives and property. Addressing this issue requires public discourse and consensus on ethical guidelines for autonomous decision-making.",
    "**Regulatory Compliance and Infrastructure**: As self-driving technology advances, regulatory frameworks may lag behind, leading to inconsistencies in traffic laws and vehicle standards. Additionally, existing infrastructure may not be equipped to handle autonomous vehicles, leading to potential safety hazards. Collaborating with government agencies to develop comprehensive regulations and upgrading infrastructure will be crucial for the safe integration of self-driving cars into society.",
    "**Public Perception and Acceptance**: There may be skepticism and fear surrounding the use of self-driving cars, stemming from concerns about safety, reliability, and loss of control. Overcoming these perceptions will require extensive public education campaigns, transparency about the technology's capabilities, and real-world demonstrations of its safety and effectiveness. Building trust in autonomous vehicles is essential for widespread adoption.",
    "**Maintenance and Technical Support**: Self-driving cars are complex machines that require regular maintenance and updates to their software systems. Owners may face challenges in finding qualified technicians who can service these vehicles, as well as understanding the intricacies of their maintenance needs. Establishing a network of trained professionals and creating user-friendly guides for owners can help mitigate these challenges."
