    "**Self-Cleaning Mechanism**: Design a juicer with a built-in self-cleaning function. After use, the juicer could automatically fill with water and a cleaning solution, agitate for a few minutes, and then drain, ensuring that all parts are sanitized without the user needing to disassemble or scrub the machine. This feature would save time and encourage more frequent use.",
    "**Multi-Function Juicer**: Create a juicer that can also function as a blender, food processor, and ice cream maker. This all-in-one device would allow users to make smoothies, soups, and frozen desserts, maximizing its utility and minimizing counter space. Interchangeable parts could be designed to easily switch between functions.",
    "**Portable Juicer with Rechargeable Battery**: Develop a compact, portable juicer that runs on a rechargeable battery, making it perfect for on-the-go lifestyles. Users could juice fruits and vegetables anywhere, whether at the gym, office, or during travel. The juicer could include a built-in storage container for the juice, ensuring freshness and convenience.",
    "**Eco-Friendly Juicer with Composting Feature**: Design a juicer that not only extracts juice but also has a composting compartment for the leftover pulp. This compartment could be equipped with a mini-composter that uses worms or microbes to break down the waste, allowing users to create nutrient-rich compost for their gardens, thus promoting sustainability and reducing waste.",
    "**Juicer with Flavor Infusion Technology**: Introduce a juicer that allows users to infuse flavors into their juices. By adding herbs, spices, or citrus peels into a separate infusion chamber, users can create unique flavor profiles without altering the base juice. This feature would appeal to culinary enthusiasts looking to experiment with new taste combinations."
