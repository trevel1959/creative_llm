    "**Glass and Transparent Materials**: In a mirror-less world, people might turn to other transparent surfaces like glass. Large panes of glass, such as those found in buildings or vehicles, could serve as makeshift mirrors. This could lead to innovative designs where architecture incorporates reflective glass features, not only for aesthetic purposes but also for practical use, allowing individuals to check their appearance while navigating through urban environments.",
    "**Polished Metal Surfaces**: People could start using polished metal surfaces, such as stainless steel or aluminum, to see their reflections. This could lead to a renaissance in metalwork, where artisans create beautifully polished sculptures or functional objects that double as reflective surfaces. The artistic aspect of reflection would become a prominent theme, merging functionality with creativity in everyday objects.",
    "**Digital Reflection Devices**: With the absence of mirrors, technology could fill the gap. Devices equipped with cameras could project a real-time image of the user onto a screen, allowing them to see their reflection. These devices could be portable, leading to the development of fashion apps that suggest outfits or makeup based on the userâ€™s appearance, thus merging technology with personal grooming and style.",
    "**Interactive Reflection Walls**: In public spaces, interactive walls could be designed to display reflections of individuals passing by. Using advanced technology, these walls could use sensors to capture images and project them in a stylized manner, perhaps even altering the appearance with filters or artistic effects. This would not only provide a reflection but also create an engaging experience, encouraging social interaction and creativity.",
    "**Shadow Play**: Without mirrors, people might become more attuned to their shadows. Utilizing creative lighting, individuals could explore their silhouettes and shapes cast on various surfaces. This could inspire new forms of art, where shadow puppetry or shadow installations become popular, encouraging people to express themselves through their shadowy outlines rather than direct reflections."
