    "**Plot Holes and Inconsistencies**: As the screenplay progresses, writers may inadvertently introduce plot holes or inconsistencies in the storyline. These gaps can confuse viewers and undermine the narrative's credibility. To avoid this, writers should maintain a detailed outline and timeline, frequently revisiting earlier scenes to ensure continuity and coherence throughout the script.",
    "**Pacing Issues**: Striking the right balance in pacing can be challenging. A screenplay might drag in certain sections, leading to viewer disengagement, or it may rush through crucial plot points, leaving audiences confused. To address pacing, writers can use a beat sheet to map out key moments, ensuring that the story flows smoothly and maintains the audience's interest throughout.",
    "**Dialogue Authenticity**: Writing dialogue that feels natural and true to each character can be a significant hurdle. Poorly written dialogue can come off as clich√©d or unrealistic, detracting from the overall quality of the screenplay. To enhance dialogue authenticity, writers can engage in real conversations, observe how people speak in various contexts, and incorporate those nuances into their scripts.",
    "**Genre Confusion**: Sometimes, a screenplay may struggle with genre identity, leading to mixed signals about the tone and style of the film. This can confuse audiences and dilute the impact of the story. To maintain clarity, writers should establish a clear genre from the outset and ensure that the screenplay adheres to the conventions and expectations of that genre while still allowing for creative twists.",
    "**Theme Clarity**: A screenplay may lack a clear central theme, resulting in a disjointed narrative that fails to resonate with viewers. Without a strong thematic foundation, the story can feel aimless or superficial. Writers can address this by identifying the core message they want to convey early in the writing process and ensuring that each scene and character arc reinforces that theme."
