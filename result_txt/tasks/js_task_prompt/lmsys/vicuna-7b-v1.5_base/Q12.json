    "Food and Resources: Another significant difference would be the availability and types of food. People would have to rely on underwater farming and fishing, which would require new technologies and methods to ensure sustainable resources. Additionally, underwater mining for resources like gold, silver, and rare earth elements could become a viable option, providing new opportunities for economic growth.",
    "Transportation: Traveling underwater would be much faster and more efficient than on land. People could use advanced underwater vehicles like personal submarines or high-speed trains that travel through tubes beneath the ocean floor. This would reduce travel time and make it easier to travel long distances.",
    "Education: Education would also be different underwater. Schools would need to be designed to accommodate the unique environment, with specialized classrooms and equipment to teach subjects like marine biology, oceanography, and underwater engineering. Additionally, students would learn how to dive and navigate underwater, which would be a valuable skill for exploration and research.",
    "Healthcare: Healthcare would also be different underwater. Medical professionals would need to be trained in underwater medicine, which would involve treating injuries and illnesses that occur in the ocean environment. Additionally, underwater hospitals and clinics would need to be equipped with advanced life support systems and specialized equipment to handle emergencies that occur underwater.",
    "Entertainment: Entertainment would also be different underwater. People could participate in underwater sports like scuba diving, snorkeling, and underwater photography. Additionally, underwater theme parks and resorts could be developed, providing new opportunities for tourism and recreation."
