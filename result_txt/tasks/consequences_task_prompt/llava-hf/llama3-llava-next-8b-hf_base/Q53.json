    "Environmental impact would be reduced: The rapid biodegradation of plastic would reduce the environmental impact of plastic waste, as it would not persist in the environment for as long as it does now.",
    "Waste management would be simplified: With plastic biodegrading quickly, waste management systems would not need to rely on recycling or incineration as much, as the plastic would break down naturally.",
    "Plastic production would change: If plastic could biodegrade quickly, the demand for single-use plastics would decrease, leading to a shift in the production of plastics towards more sustainable and biodegradable materials.",
    "Marine life would be protected: Plastic pollution in the ocean would decrease, as plastic would break down quickly and not persist in the environment for as long.",
    "Landfills would be less crowded: With plastic biodegrading quickly, landfills would not be as crowded with plastic waste, reducing the environmental impact of waste management."
