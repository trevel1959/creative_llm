    "Treehouse Retreat: Create a network of interconnected treehouses in a nearby forest, offering a serene and eco-friendly sleeping space. Each treehouse could have a unique design, blending seamlessly into the natural surroundings. Guests could choose from different types of treehouses, such as a hammock-style \"net house,\" a cozy \"burrow\" nestled in a hollowed-out tree trunk, or a more spacious \"crown house\" perched atop a tall tree canopy.",
    "Underwater Oasis: Build an underwater sleeping chamber beneath the waves, providing a one-of-a-kind aquatic experience. The chamber could be designed to resemble an underwater garden, with soft, glowing lights and soothing sounds of marine life. Guests could drift off to sleep surrounded by colorful fish and coral, or even take a nap in a glass-bottomed pod for a more traditional sleeping experience.",
    "Aerial Nest: Construct a series of interconnected aerial platforms suspended high above the ground, creating a dreamy, ethereal sleeping space. Each platform could be designed with a different theme, such as a peaceful forest glade, a bustling city rooftop, or a serene beachside oasis. Guests could choose their preferred platform based on their mood and preferences.",
    "Cloud Cradle: Design a luxurious, floating sleeping chamber that hovers above the clouds, offering breathtaking views of the sky and surrounding landscape. The chamber could be equipped with comfortable, cloud-like mattresses and soft, billowy curtains that create a cozy, dreamy atmosphere. Guests could even enjoy a gentle, zero-gravity sleep experience, floating effortlessly above the clouds.",
    "Temporary Tents: Create a series of portable, pop-up tents that can be set up in various locations around the city or in nature. Each tent could be designed with a unique theme, such as a nomadic desert tent, a whimsical forest tent, or a sleek, modern city tent. Guests could choose their preferred tent based on their mood and the location they desire, providing a fun and flexible sleeping experience."
