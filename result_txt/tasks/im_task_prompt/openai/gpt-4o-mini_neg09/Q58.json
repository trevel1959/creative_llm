    "**Hands-Free Design**: Create a hair dryer that can be mounted on a wall or used with a flexible arm. This would allow users to dry their hair without having to hold the dryer, freeing up their hands for styling or multitasking. The design could include a rotating head to reach all angles of the hair and adjustable height settings to accommodate different users.",
    "**Built-in Hair Styling Tools**: Combine a hair dryer with styling tools such as a curling iron or straightener. The device could have interchangeable attachments that easily snap on and off, allowing users to switch from drying to styling in one seamless motion. This would save time and space, making it a versatile tool for all hair types.",
    "**Eco-Friendly Features**: Develop a hair dryer that utilizes sustainable materials and energy-efficient technology. This could include a solar-powered option or a model that generates its own power through kinetic energy. Additionally, the dryer could be made from biodegradable materials, promoting an environmentally friendly approach to personal care.",
    "**Noise Reduction Technology**: Implement advanced noise-cancellation technology to create a quieter hair dryer. This could be achieved through specially designed fan blades and sound-dampening materials, making the drying experience more pleasant and less disruptive for users and those around them.",
    "**Aromatherapy Infuser**: Design a hair dryer that includes an aromatherapy infuser. Users could add essential oils or scented beads to a designated compartment, allowing the warm air to disperse soothing fragrances while drying their hair. This would enhance the drying experience, providing a spa-like atmosphere at home."
