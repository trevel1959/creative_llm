    "**Island Mapping and Resource Identification**: Upon waking up on the deserted island, I would immediately start creating a mental map of the island, noting the location of potential resources such as fresh water sources, food sources, and shelter materials. I would use natural landmarks like rocks, trees, and beaches to create a visual map in my mind. This would help me navigate the island efficiently and identify the best locations for gathering resources.",
    "**Shelter Construction**: Using the materials I've identified, I would construct a sturdy shelter to protect myself from the elements. I would gather branches, leaves, and other natural materials to create a lean-to or a debris hut. I would also collect dry leaves, grasses, and other insulating materials to line the shelter and keep it dry. This would provide me with a safe place to rest, store my resources, and potentially start a fire.",
    "**Fire Starting**: Fire would be a crucial element for survival, providing warmth, light, and a way to cook food. I would use various methods to start a fire, such as friction, solar fire starting, or using a makeshift bow drill. Once I have a fire going, I would use it to cook food, purify water, and signal for help.",
    "**Food Procurement and Preservation**: I would identify the island's edible plants, fruits, and animals, and learn how to harvest and prepare them safely. I would also learn how to preserve food through methods like smoking, drying, or fermenting, to ensure a steady food supply. This would involve experimenting with different techniques and monitoring the island's seasonal changes to optimize my food gathering.",
    "**Signaling for Help**: As the days turn into weeks, I would focus on signaling for help to potential rescuers. I would create a smoke signal during the day, using dry leaves and branches to create a thick smoke that can be seen from a distance. At night, I would use a makeshift torch or a fire to create a visible signal. I would also use natural materials like rocks, shells, or palm fronds to create a visible signal on the beach or on a hilltop. This would increase my chances of being spotted by passing aircraft or boats."
