    "Automatic cutting: Implementing an automatic cutting mechanism that can be activated by a button or a sensor can improve the efficiency of cutting tasks. This can be especially useful for people with limited dexterity or those who need to cut large quantities of materials.",
    "Adjustable cutting length: Adding an adjustable cutting length feature to the scissors can improve precision and reduce waste. The user can adjust the length of the cut based on their needs, ensuring that they only cut the desired amount of material.",
    "Built-in ruler: Incorporating a built-in ruler into the scissors can improve accuracy and precision. The ruler can be marked with measurements, allowing the user to easily measure and cut materials to the desired length.",
    "LED light: Adding an LED light to the scissors can improve visibility in low-light conditions. The light can be activated by a button or a sensor, providing illumination for the cutting area and reducing the risk of accidents.",
    "Magnetic blades: Incorporating magnetic blades into the scissors can improve cutting performance and reduce the risk of injury. The blades can be attracted to each other, ensuring that they stay sharp and aligned during use."
