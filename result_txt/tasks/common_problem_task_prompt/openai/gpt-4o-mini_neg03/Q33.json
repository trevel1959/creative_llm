    "**Food Sources**: The challenge of finding enough food can lead to malnutrition or starvation. Exploring the island for edible plants, fruits, and nuts is crucial. Additionally, setting up fishing traps or using makeshift fishing gear can help secure protein. Foraging for insects, which are high in protein, can also be a viable option, especially in the absence of larger animals.",
    "**Shelter Construction**: Exposure to the elements can lead to hypothermia or heat exhaustion. Building a sturdy shelter is essential. Using fallen branches, palm fronds, and leaves can create a roof that protects against rain and sun. A raised platform can help keep the sleeping area dry and insulated from the ground.",
    "**Navigation and Signaling for Rescue**: If rescue is the goal, establishing a way to signal for help is vital. Creating large SOS signs on the beach using rocks or logs can attract the attention of passing ships or planes. Additionally, crafting a smoke signal using green leaves and a fire can help in signaling rescuers.",
    "**Mental Health and Isolation**: The psychological toll of being stranded can lead to anxiety and despair. Engaging in daily routines, setting small goals, and maintaining a journal can help keep the mind active. Additionally, creating a \"survival buddy\" system with any fellow survivors can provide emotional support and companionship.",
    "**Injury and Medical Emergencies**: Accidents can happen, and without medical assistance, even minor injuries can become serious. Creating a first-aid kit from natural resources, such as using tree sap as an antiseptic or finding medicinal plants, can help treat wounds. Additionally, learning basic first-aid techniques can be lifesaving."
