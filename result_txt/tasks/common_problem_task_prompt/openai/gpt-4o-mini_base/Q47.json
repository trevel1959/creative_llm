    "**Static Electricity Damage**: Handling computer components without proper precautions can lead to static electricity discharges, which can damage sensitive parts like the CPU or RAM. This problem can be mitigated by using anti-static wrist straps, working on non-static surfaces, and grounding oneself before touching components.",
    "**Cooling and Airflow Issues**: Building a computer with inadequate cooling solutions can lead to overheating, especially during heavy use. Choosing the right CPU cooler, case fans, and ensuring proper airflow through the case are critical. A poorly designed cooling setup can cause thermal throttling, reducing performance, or even hardware failure.",
    "**Cable Management and Accessibility**: A common oversight during assembly is poor cable management, which can lead to cluttered interiors that obstruct airflow and make future upgrades or troubleshooting difficult. A well-organized setup not only looks better but also improves cooling efficiency and accessibility for repairs or upgrades.",
    "**Software Installation and Driver Issues**: After successfully assembling the hardware, users may encounter problems during the operating system installation or when installing drivers for various components. Incompatibilities or outdated drivers can lead to system instability or failure to recognize hardware. It's essential to have the latest drivers and to ensure the operating system is compatible with the hardware.",
    "**BIOS/UEFI Configuration Challenges**: Upon first boot, users may need to configure the BIOS/UEFI settings for optimal performance or to recognize all installed components. This can be daunting for beginners who may not know what settings to change or how to troubleshoot issues like boot failure or hardware not being detected."
