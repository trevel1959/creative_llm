    "A new era of exploration: If humans were to discover immortality, it would open up a whole new world of possibilities for exploration. People could travel to distant planets and explore uncharted territories without fear of death. This could lead to groundbreaking discoveries in science, technology, and even philosophy.",
    "Overpopulation: On the other hand, immortality could also lead to an overpopulation crisis. With no natural way to limit population growth, people could continue to multiply indefinitely, leading to resource depletion and environmental destruction.",
    "Changes in social structures: Immortality could also have significant impacts on social structures. For example, people who lived forever might become less invested in traditional values such as family or community, leading to a breakdown in social norms.",
    "The creation of new classes: As some people became immortal while others remained mortal, new classes could emerge. Wealthy individuals who had access to immortality could become the ruling class, while ordinary people would struggle to survive.",
    "The end of religion: If people became immortal, many religious beliefs about life, death, and afterlife would likely become obsolete. This could lead to a decline in religious practices and a shift towards more secular beliefs."
