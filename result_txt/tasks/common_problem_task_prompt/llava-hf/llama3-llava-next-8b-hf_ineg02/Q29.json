    "Pressure changes: As the team descends into the deep sea, the pressure increases, which can affect the team's physical abilities. The risk of decompression sickness, also known as \"the bends,\" is a potential problem that could impact the team's performance and safety.",
    "Limited air supply: Deep-sea missions often require scuba diving, which has a limited air supply. The team must be careful to manage their air supply and avoid running out, as this could lead to drowning or other serious injuries.",
    "Equipment failure: The team's equipment, such as scuba gear, submersibles, and communication devices, must be in good working order. Equipment failure could lead to serious accidents or the inability to complete the mission.",
    "Water hazards: The deep sea is home to many dangerous creatures, such as sharks, jellyfish, and other marine animals that could pose a threat to the team. Additionally, underwater currents and other natural hazards could make navigation and exploration more difficult.",
    "Physical demands: Deep-sea exploration requires a high level of physical fitness, as the team must withstand the pressure and cold temperatures. Fatigue could impact the team's ability to perform critical tasks, such as maintaining the submersible or conducting scientific experiments."
