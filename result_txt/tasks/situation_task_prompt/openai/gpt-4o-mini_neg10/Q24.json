    "**Community Vision Workshops**: Local communities could organize workshops where individuals with poor vision learn skills to adapt to their condition. These workshops could cover topics like spatial awareness, using auditory cues for navigation, and even training on how to use assistive technologies effectively. Such community-driven initiatives would foster support networks and empower individuals to cope with their vision challenges.",
    "**Wearable Haptic Feedback Devices**: Innovators could develop wearable devices that provide haptic feedback to assist with navigation. These could be smart bracelets or belts that vibrate in different patterns to indicate obstacles, directions, or distances. For example, a quick pulse could mean an object is nearby, while a longer vibration could indicate the direction to turn. This would help individuals move around safely and confidently without relying on sight.",
    "**Biometric Eye Tracking Glasses**: Researchers could explore the development of biometric glasses that track eye movements and analyze visual input in real-time. These glasses could provide auditory descriptions of the environment, such as reading text aloud or identifying objects and people nearby. They would serve as a high-tech alternative to traditional glasses and could be personalized to each user's specific visual impairments.",
    "**Customized Visual Navigation Systems**: Urban planners could collaborate with tech companies to create customized navigation systems for public spaces that cater to those with poor vision. These systems could include tactile maps, auditory signals at crosswalks, and smart sidewalks that provide feedback through vibrations. Such infrastructure would make cities more accessible and allow individuals with vision impairments to navigate independently.",
    "**Vision Rehabilitation Programs**: Health organizations could implement comprehensive vision rehabilitation programs that focus on teaching adaptive techniques for daily living. These programs could include training in using sensory cues, like sound and touch, to recognize objects, read braille, and develop cognitive mapping skills. By providing structured support, individuals would gain confidence and independence in managing their daily activities."
