    "**Self-Cleaning Technology**:    - **Explanation**: Utilize UV-C light technology within the bottle's cap to self-sanitize the interior. This would eliminate harmful bacteria and odors without the need for chemical cleaners. Users would simply activate the self-cleaning feature with a button press, ensuring their water stays fresh and safe to drink.",
    "**Flavor Infuser Chamber**:    - **Explanation**: Design a detachable compartment that allows users to infuse their water with natural flavors from fruits, herbs, or spices. This compartment could have a built-in strainer to keep solid pieces separate while still allowing the flavor to permeate the water. This would encourage more people to stay hydrated by making drinking water more enjoyable.",
    "**Modular Design**:    - **Explanation**: Create a water bottle with a modular design that allows users to customize its features. Different modules could include a fruit infuser, a filter for tap water, a cooling sleeve, or a storage compartment for snacks. This way, users can adapt their bottle to suit their needs for different activities, whether it’s hiking, gym workouts, or daily commuting.",
    "**Eco-Friendly Materials with Plant-Based Technology**:    - **Explanation**: Develop a water bottle made from biodegradable materials that incorporate plant-based technology, allowing the bottle to break down naturally after its lifecycle. Additionally, the bottle could be infused with seeds, so when it’s time to dispose of it, users can plant it in the ground to grow a tree or plant, promoting sustainability and environmental awareness.",
    "**Integrated Filter and Water Quality Tester**:    - **Explanation**: Incorporate a multi-stage filtration system within the bottle that can purify water from various sources. Additionally, add a digital water quality tester that displays real-time data on contaminants, pH levels, and temperature on a small screen. This feature would provide peace of mind to users, especially when drinking from questionable sources while traveling or hiking."
