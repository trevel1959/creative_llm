    "Build a Light-Harvesting Dome: Construct a large, transparent dome over the city, covered in photovoltaic cells that can convert sunlight into electricity. This dome would collect and store energy during the day, providing a reliable source of light even if the sun doesn't rise.",
    "Sun-Simulating LED Lights: Develop LED lights that mimic the sun's spectrum and intensity. These lights could be installed in homes, offices, and public spaces, providing a natural and sustainable source of light.",
    "Solar-Powered Streetlights: Install solar-powered streetlights that can harness energy from the sun during the day and provide light at night. These streetlights could be equipped with advanced sensors and Wi-Fi connectivity, enabling real-time monitoring and control.",
    "Cloud-Seeding Technology: Develop a cloud-seeding technology that can stimulate the formation of artificial clouds, providing a natural and sustainable source of light. This technology could be used to create clouds that reflect sunlight back into the atmosphere, providing a diffused and soft light during the day.",
    "Bioluminescent Plant-Based Lighting: Genetically engineer plants to produce bioluminescent properties, creating a natural and sustainable source of light. These plants could be integrated into various applications, such as indoor gardens, vertical farms, and even streetlights."
