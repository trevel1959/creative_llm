    "Smart Toothbrush: Develop a toothbrush that uses sensors and artificial intelligence to monitor and improve the user's brushing habits. The toothbrush can provide personalized feedback on areas that need improvement, track the user's progress over time, and suggest changes to the user's brushing routine to improve oral health.",
    "Toothbrush with UV Sanitization: Create a toothbrush that uses UV light to sanitize the bristles and handle between uses. This would eliminate the need for users to replace their toothbrush heads frequently, reducing waste and promoting sustainability.",
    "Toothbrush with Built-In Water Reservoir: Design a toothbrush that has a built-in water reservoir, allowing users to brush their teeth without the need for running water. This would be especially useful for people who travel frequently or live in areas with limited water access.",
    "Toothbrush with Interactive Games: Create a toothbrush that includes interactive games and challenges to make brushing more fun and engaging. The games could be based on timers, rewards, or educational content related to oral health.",
    "Toothbrush with Voice Commands: Develop a toothbrush that can be controlled using voice commands. Users could set the toothbrush to a specific brushing mode, adjust the speed and pressure, and even play music to accompany their brushing routine."
