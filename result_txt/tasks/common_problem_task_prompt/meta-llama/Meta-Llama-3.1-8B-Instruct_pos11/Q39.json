    "**Eco-Entrepreneurship Initiative**: Implement a universal basic income (UBI) that encourages entrepreneurship and sustainability. This UBI would be funded by a carbon tax on fossil fuels, with the revenue generated used to support eco-friendly businesses and projects. This approach would not only provide a basic income but also incentivize the development of sustainable technologies and practices.",
    "**Skill-Based UBI**: Introduce a UBI that is based on an individual's skills and abilities, rather than their employment status. This would be achieved through a blockchain-based platform that verifies and rewards individuals for their skills, allowing them to access a basic income. This approach would promote lifelong learning, skill development, and a more inclusive economy.",
    "**Community-Led UBI**: Establish a UBI that is managed and implemented at the community level, allowing local communities to decide how the funds are allocated and distributed. This would involve a decentralized, blockchain-based system that enables community members to contribute to and participate in the decision-making process. This approach would foster community engagement, social cohesion, and a sense of ownership.",
    "**AI-Powered UBI**: Develop an AI-driven UBI system that uses machine learning algorithms to identify and address poverty and inequality. This AI system would analyze data on individual circumstances, providing personalized support and resources to those in need. This approach would ensure that the UBI is targeted and effective, while also promoting innovation and efficiency in the delivery of social services.",
    "**Circular Economy UBI**: Implement a UBI that is linked to the principles of a circular economy, where waste is minimized, and resources are shared and reused. This UBI would be funded by a deposit-refund system for single-use plastics, with the revenue generated used to support recycling initiatives and circular economy projects. This approach would promote sustainability, reduce waste, and create new economic opportunities. [/INST] "
