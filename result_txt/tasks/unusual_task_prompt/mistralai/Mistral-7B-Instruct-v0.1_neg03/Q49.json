    "\"Frame-less Frame\": This idea is to create a picture frame without any traditional borders. Instead, the picture is placed on a transparent sheet that is lit from behind, giving the impression that the image is floating in mid-air. This can be a unique and modern way to showcase a favorite photo or artwork.",
    "\"Mixed Media Frame\": A frame made from a combination of different materials, such as wood, metal, and glass, can add texture and interest to any photo or artwork. The materials can be arranged in a variety of ways, such as layered or intertwined, to create a visually appealing and one-of-a-kind frame.",
    "\"Interactive Frame\": This idea is to create a frame that allows the viewer to interact with the photo or artwork. For example, a frame with a touch screen or buttons that allow the user to zoom in, adjust the brightness or contrast, or even play a video or animation related to the photo or artwork.",
    "\"3D Frame\": A frame that is made from a 3D printing process can add depth and dimension to any photo or artwork. The frame can be designed to have curves, angles, or other unique shapes that make it stand out from traditional frames.",
    "\"Modular Frame\": This idea is to create a frame that can be customized and expanded as needed. The frame can be made from modular pieces that can be added or removed to fit the size and shape of the photo or artwork. This can be a practical and versatile option for those who want to change their frame frequently or have multiple photos or artwork to display."
