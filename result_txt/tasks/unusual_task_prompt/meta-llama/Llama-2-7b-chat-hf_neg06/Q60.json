    "Smart Hanger: A clothes hanger with a built-in smart chip that can detect when an item of clothing is put on or taken off, and automatically adjust the temperature and humidity levels in the closet to create the perfect environment for that specific garment. This would help to prevent damage to delicate fabrics and ensure that clothes stay in good condition for longer.",
    "Virtual Try-On: A clothes hanger with a virtual try-on feature that allows users to see how different outfits would look on them without having to physically try them on. This would save time and reduce the number of times clothing is tried on and removed, resulting in a more efficient and sustainable way of shopping.",
    "Personalized Closet Organizer: A clothes hanger with a personalized closet organizer that uses AI to learn the user's preferences and habits, and then organizes their clothes accordingly. For example, it could group similar items together, prioritize frequently worn items, and even suggest new outfits based on the user's style and preferences.",
    "Hanger with Built-In Lighting: A clothes hanger with built-in LED lighting that can help to highlight specific areas of the garment, making it easier to see details such as stains or damage. This could be particularly useful for tailors and seamstresses who need to carefully inspect garments before repairing them.",
    "Sustainable Hanger: A clothes hanger made from sustainable materials such as bamboo or recycled plastic, which would be biodegradable and compostable at the end of its life. This would reduce the amount of waste generated by traditional clothes hangers, which are often made from non-biodegradable materials and end up in landfills."
