    "**Solar-Powered Desalination Plants**: Develop a network of solar-powered desalination plants across affected areas. These plants use solar energy to convert seawater or brackish water into fresh water through processes like reverse osmosis. The solar energy is sustainable and ensures that the water supply isn't reliant on any external energy source. **Confidence Score: 0.9**",
    "**Rainwater Harvesting Systems**: Implement large-scale rainwater harvesting systems in urban and rural areas. These systems capture rainwater and store it for future use. With proper filtration and purification techniques, this water can be made safe for drinking. Rainwater is usually cleaner than other sources and can provide a significant amount of fresh water. **Confidence Score: 0.8**",
    "**Biofiltration Ponds**: Establish biofiltration ponds where natural biological processes remove contaminants from water. These ponds are filled with vegetation and gravel that act as filters, breaking down pollutants and pathogens. After treatment, the water can be used for drinking after further purification. This method is eco-friendly and can be integrated into green spaces or even rooftops. **Confidence Score: 0.85**",
    "**Portable Water Purification Devices**: Design and distribute portable water purifiers that can be carried to remote areas. These devices might include UV sterilization, activated carbon filters, or ceramic filters. They are lightweight, easy to use, and effective in removing bacteria, viruses, and other contaminants. This solution empowers individuals and communities to have access to clean water when traditional sources fail. **Confidence Score: 0.9**",
    "**Cloud Water Collection**: Innovate cloud water collection methods using special collectors that condense moisture from the air. This technique is particularly useful in areas with high humidity but low rainfall. Once collected, the water can be purified and stored for drinking purposes. It's an innovative way to utilize an often overlooked resource, especially in coastal regions. **Confidence Score: 0.8**"
