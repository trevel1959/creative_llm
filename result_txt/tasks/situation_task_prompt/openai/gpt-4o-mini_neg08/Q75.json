    "**Electric Vehicles with Advanced Battery Technology**: The automotive industry could shift entirely to electric vehicles (EVs) powered by advanced battery technologies. Innovations such as solid-state batteries, which have higher energy densities and faster charging times, could replace lithium-ion batteries. Furthermore, widespread development of fast-charging stations and battery swapping systems could alleviate range anxiety and make EVs more practical for long-distance travel.",
    "**Biofuels from Algae**: Algae-based biofuels could become a major source of energy for vehicles. Algae can be cultivated in a variety of environments, including non-arable land and wastewater, making it a sustainable option. It can produce oil that can be converted into biodiesel or ethanol, providing a renewable fuel source. With the right infrastructure in place, vehicles could run on these biofuels, significantly reducing greenhouse gas emissions compared to fossil fuels.",
    "**Magnetic Levitation and Inductive Charging**: Vehicles could utilize magnetic levitation (maglev) technology combined with inductive charging systems. Maglev vehicles would glide above tracks, reducing friction and energy loss, while inductive charging pads embedded in the roads could continuously charge vehicles as they travel. This would create a dynamic transportation system where vehicles are powered while in motion, eliminating the need for traditional fuel altogether.",
    "**Compressed Air Vehicles**: Compressed air technology could power vehicles by using compressed air stored in tanks to drive pistons that turn the wheels. This technology would require a network of refueling stations that compress air quickly and efficiently. While still in development, compressed air vehicles could offer a zero-emission alternative, as they would only release air during operation. This system could be particularly useful for urban environments, where shorter distances are traveled.",
    "**Solar-Powered Vehicles**: Cars could be designed with integrated solar panels that harness sunlight to power electric motors. Innovations in solar technology, such as transparent solar cells that can be applied to windows, could maximize the surface area available for energy collection. With advancements in energy storage, these vehicles could store excess energy for use during cloudy days or at night, making them a self-sustaining option for transportation."
