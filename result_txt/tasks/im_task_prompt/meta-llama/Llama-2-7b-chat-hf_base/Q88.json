    "Glow-in-the-Dark Ski Poles: These ski poles are designed with a special glow-in-the-dark coating that illuminates the snowy terrain, providing improved visibility and safety for skiers, especially during nighttime skiing or in low-light conditions. The glowing effect can be achieved through the use of phosphorescent materials, which absorb and store light energy and then release it back out, creating a soft, gentle glow.",
    "Adjustable Ski Poles: These poles are designed with interchangeable grips and shafts, allowing skiers to adjust the length and weight of their poles to suit their personal preferences and skiing style. For example, a skier who prefers a more aggressive stance can use a longer pole with a heavier grip, while a skier who prefers a more relaxed stance can use a shorter pole with a lighter grip. This feature allows skiers to customize their poles to their specific needs and improve their overall performance on the slopes.",
    "Smart Ski Poles: These poles are equipped with advanced technology, such as built-in sensors and GPS, that provide skiers with real-time data on their speed, distance, and vertical descent. This information can be displayed on a built-in screen or through a companion app, allowing skiers to track their progress and improve their skiing skills. Additionally, the sensors can detect and alert skiers to potential hazards, such as rocks or trees, and provide navigation assistance to help them avoid obstacles and stay on course.",
    "Ergonomic Ski Poles: These poles are designed with ergonomic grips and shafts that are tailored to fit the natural curvature of the human hand and forearm. This design provides improved comfort and control for skiers, reducing fatigue and strain on the hands and wrists, and allowing them to maintain a consistent and efficient skiing technique. The ergonomic design can also help to prevent injuries and improve overall skiing performance.",
    "Heated Ski Poles: These poles are designed with built-in heating elements, such as carbon fiber or aluminum, that warm up in cold temperatures, providing improved grip and control for skiers. The heating elements"
