    "**Celestial Bodies**: Another way to keep track of time is by observing the positions of celestial bodies like the moon and stars. The moon goes through phases every 29.5 days, and stars can be used to determine the time of night. However, this method is also not very accurate and requires a clear night sky.",
    "**Water Clock**: A water clock, also known as a clepsydra, uses the flow of water to measure time. The water is released at a constant rate, and the level of the water in the clock indicates the time. This method has been used for centuries in many cultures.",
    "**Sand Clock**: A sand clock, also known as an hourglass, uses sand to measure time. The sand flows from one chamber to another at a constant rate, and the time is measured by the amount of sand that has passed through. This method is simple and easy to use but requires constant attention.",
    "**Bio Rhythm**: The human body has an internal clock that regulates our daily activities, known as the circadian rhythm. By paying attention to our natural sleep-wake cycle, we can estimate the time of day without relying on any external devices.",
    "**Animal Behavior**: Some animals have a natural sense of time, and their behavior can be used to estimate the time of day. For example, birds often sing at dawn and dusk, which can be used to determine the time of day."
