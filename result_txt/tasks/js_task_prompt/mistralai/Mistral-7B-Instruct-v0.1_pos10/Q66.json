    "A Private Beach: The first thing I would do is create a pristine beach with crystal clear water and white sand. The beach would be surrounded by lush greenery and tall palm trees for shade.",
    "Luxurious Accommodations: I would design a luxurious villa with multiple bedrooms, a spacious living room, a gourmet kitchen, and a private pool. The villa would be built with eco-friendly materials and feature solar panels for energy efficiency.",
    "Adventure Activities: I would include a variety of adventure activities such as scuba diving, snorkeling, hiking, and kayaking. The island would also have a zip-lining course and a rock climbing wall.",
    "Fine Dining: I would create a restaurant that serves gourmet cuisine made with fresh, locally sourced ingredients. The restaurant would feature a beautiful ocean view and a romantic atmosphere.",
    "Wellness and Relaxation: I would include a spa that offers a variety of treatments such as massages, facials, and body scrubs. The spa would also have a meditation room and a yoga studio for guests to relax and rejuvenate."
