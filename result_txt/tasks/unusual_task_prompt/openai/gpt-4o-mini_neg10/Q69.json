    "**Melt Crayons for Art Projects**: Use a hairdryer to melt crayons onto canvas or paper for a unique art project. Place broken crayon pieces at the top of the canvas, and use the hairdryer on a high setting to melt them down. The melted wax will drip down, creating colorful patterns and designs. This can be a fun activity for kids or a creative outlet for adults.",
    "**Unstick Stuck Items**: If you have stickers, tape, or labels that are difficult to remove, a hairdryer can help.
