    "**Microfilm**: Microfilm has been used for storing large amounts of data in a compact form for many years. It works by creating micro-sized negatives that can be read through a special projector. In case of digital data loss, converting all data into microfilm negatives could provide a safe storage solution. The negatives can be stored in a temperature-controlled environment to prevent degradation.",
    "**DNA Sequencing**: Scientists are exploring the use of DNA as a storage medium for data. DNA can store vast amounts of information in a very small space. By encoding digital data into DNA sequences, it could potentially be stored in a secure, biological format. This method would require developing sophisticated techniques to read and write DNA, but could offer a robust way to preserve information indefinitely.",
    "**Seismic Recording**: Seismographs can record seismic waves caused by earthquakes. By programming these devices to also record electronic data, such as audio or digital files, they could act as a decentralized storage system. Placing these devices around the world would create a global network capable of storing data in a physical form that is less susceptible to cyber threats.",
    "**Magnetic Sand**: Researchers have developed a new type of magnetic sand that can be used to write data onto its surface using magnets. Once written, the data can be read by scanning the surface with a magnet. This method provides a low-tech, portable solution for storing information. The sand could be packaged in sealed containers to protect it from environmental factors like water and dust.",
    "**Quantum Entanglement**: Quantum entanglement involves particles that become connected in such a way that the state of one particle can instantaneously affect the state of another, no matter the distance between them. Scientists could potentially use this phenomenon to encode and transmit information across long distances without the need for wires or light signals. In a scenario where digital data was lost, quantum entanglement could serve as a secure, instantaneous backup method, provided the technology is advanced enough."
