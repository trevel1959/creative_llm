    "**Eco-Friendly Wedding Venue**: Rent a secluded, rustic venue that's surrounded by nature. This will not only reduce the carbon footprint of transporting guests but also provide a serene backdrop for the ceremony and reception. To further minimize waste, consider using locally sourced and sustainable materials for decorations, furniture, and even the wedding cake.",
    "**Sustainable Transportation**: Organize a group transportation service using electric or hybrid vehicles to transport guests from the ceremony to the reception. This will not only reduce emissions but also encourage guests to carpool or use public transportation. You can also consider renting a vintage bus or a classic car to add a touch of elegance to the event.",
    "**Zero-Waste Food and Drinks**: Hire a catering service that specializes in zero-waste cuisine. This can be achieved by using compostable or biodegradable plates, cups, and utensils. Additionally, consider serving locally sourced, seasonal, and organic food to reduce the carbon footprint of transportation. You can also set up a DIY cocktail bar with refillable glasses and a signature drink made from locally sourced ingredients.",
    "**Eco-Friendly Favors**: Instead of giving guests traditional wedding favors, consider gifting them with small potted plants, seed bombs, or packets of wildflower seeds. These can be planted in the couple's new home or taken back to their own gardens, promoting sustainability and greenery. You can also create a customized map of the wedding location with a list of eco-friendly attractions and activities for guests to explore.",
    "**Charity Donation**: Partner with a local environmental organization or charity and make a donation in lieu of traditional wedding gifts. This can be announced during the ceremony or reception, and guests can contribute to the cause by making a donation in the couple's name. You can also set up a fundraising station with eco-friendly products or services, such as reusable water bottles or energy-efficient light bulbs, with a portion of the proceeds going to the charity."
