The final treasure can be a chest filled with gold coins (chocolate coins or candy) and a special birthday gift. To make it more engaging, you can hide the clues in creative spots, such as inside hollowed-out books or inside a fake rock.",
    "**Superhero Training Academy**: Set up an obstacle course where kids can become superheroes-in-training. The course can include activities like crawling through tunnels, jumping over hurdles, and tossing \"energy balls\" ( beanbags or soft balls).

You can also have a \"treasure dig\" activity where kids can dig for treasure using small shovels and buckets. Don't forget the pirate costumes and eye patches!",

Set up a \"space station\" with cardboard boxes and blankets, where kids can play with space-themed toys and snacks. You can also have a \"space mission\" activity where kids can launch \"rockets\" (paper towel rolls with streamers) into the air. To make it more interactive, you can have a \"space scavenger hunt\" where kids have to find items related to space, such as a picture of the moon or a model of a planet.",
    "**Backyard Camping Adventure**: Set up a tent in the backyard and have a camping adventure with the kids.
