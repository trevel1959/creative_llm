    "**Digital Wallets and Cryptocurrencies**: In a world without physical currency, digital wallets and cryptocurrencies would become the norm. People could use their smartphones to make transactions, and cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin, Ethereum, or others could be used for international transactions. This system would eliminate the need for physical currency and provide a secure, efficient, and global payment method.",
    "**Bartering and Trade**: Without physical currency, people might resort to bartering and trading goods and services directly. This system would require a strong sense of community and cooperation, as people would need to agree on the value of the goods and services being exchanged. It could lead to a more localized and sustainable economy.",
    "**Time-Based Currency**: A time-based currency system could be implemented, where people earn and spend time units instead of traditional currency. This system would reward people for their time and skills, and could lead to a more equitable distribution of resources. For example, a person could earn 10 time units for working an hour, and spend those units to buy goods and services.",
    "**Skill-Based Currency**: In a world without physical currency, people could earn and spend skill-based units. This system would reward people for their skills and expertise, and could lead to a more efficient allocation of resources. For example, a person could earn 5 skill units for fixing a bike, and spend those units to buy goods and services that require similar skills.",
    "**Resource-Based Economy**: A resource-based economy could be implemented, where people have access to resources and goods based on their needs, rather than their ability to pay. This system would eliminate poverty and inequality, and could lead to a more sustainable and equitable society. For example, people could access clean water, food, and shelter based on their needs, without having to pay for them."
