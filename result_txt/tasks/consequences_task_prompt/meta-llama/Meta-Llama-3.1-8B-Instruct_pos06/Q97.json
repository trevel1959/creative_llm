    "**Tidal Disruptions**: The gravitational pull of the rings would disrupt the Earth's tides, causing unpredictable and extreme tidal fluctuations. This could lead to catastrophic coastal flooding, erosion, and damage to marine ecosystems. (Confidence score: 0.9)",
    "**Ring-Induced Weather Patterns**: The presence of rings would create complex and dynamic weather patterns, potentially leading to extreme weather events such as massive storms, dust devils, and temperature fluctuations. This could have significant impacts on global climate patterns and agriculture. (Confidence score: 0.8)",
    "**Orbital Instability**: The rings would introduce additional gravitational forces that could destabilize the Earth's orbit, potentially leading to catastrophic consequences such as asteroid impacts, cometary collisions, or even a planetary ejection from the solar system. (Confidence score: 0.85)",
    "**Ring-Generated Meteors**: The rings would be composed of small, icy particles that could collide and break apart, generating a stream of meteors that could bombard the Earth's surface, causing damage to infrastructure, and posing a risk to human safety. (Confidence score: 0.92)",
    "**Planetary Magnetic Field Disruption**: The presence of rings would disrupt the Earth's magnetic field, potentially leading to a weakening of the field and increased exposure to cosmic radiation, which could have devastating effects on the planet's biosphere and human health. (Confidence score: 0.88)"
