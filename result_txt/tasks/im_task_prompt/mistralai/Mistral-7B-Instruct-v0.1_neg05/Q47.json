    "Create a vacuum cleaner that uses a robot arm with a camera and a smartphone app. The robot arm can scan the room and create a map of the floor, and the app can provide a detailed report on the cleaning progress, including areas that need more attention.",
    "Design a vacuum cleaner that uses a modular design, allowing users to easily swap out different attachments for different cleaning needs. For example, a carpet brush attachment for carpets, a hardwood floor brush attachment for hardwood floors, and a dusting brush attachment for delicate surfaces.",
    "Create a vacuum cleaner that uses a unique cleaning technology, such as ultrasonic cleaning or steam cleaning. This would allow users to clean surfaces more effectively and efficiently, and would also reduce the amount of water and chemicals needed.",
    "Develop a vacuum cleaner that is designed to be quiet and energy-efficient. This would be perfect for users who want to clean their homes without disturbing others or running up their electricity bill.",
    "Design a vacuum cleaner that is completely hands-free. The vacuum cleaner would be equipped with sensors and a smartphone app, allowing users to start, stop, and control the cleaning process from their phone. This would be perfect for busy individuals who don't have time to manually clean their homes."
