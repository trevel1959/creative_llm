    "Lack of water: Organic farming requires a significant amount of water for irrigation, especially during the dry season. If there is a lack of water, the crops may not grow, and the farm may not be sustainable.",
    "Pest and disease management: Organic farming often relies on natural pest control methods such as crop rotation, composting, and the use of beneficial insects. However, these methods may not be as effective as chemical pesticides, and the farm may be more susceptible to pest and disease infestations.",
    "Limited access to organic inputs: Organic farming requires organic inputs such as organic seeds, compost, and natural fertilizers. If these inputs are not readily available, the farm may not be able to produce organic crops.",
    "Lack of market demand: Organic farming is a niche market, and there may not be a strong demand for organic produce. This can make it difficult to sell the crops, and the farm may not be financially sustainable.",
    "High labor costs: Organic farming often requires more labor-intensive methods, such as hand-weeding and crop rotation. This can increase labor costs, making the farm less profitable."
