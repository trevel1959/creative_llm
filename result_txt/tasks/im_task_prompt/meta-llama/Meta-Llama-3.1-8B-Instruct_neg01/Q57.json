    "**Ergonomic Evolution**: Design a computer mouse that adapts to the user's hand shape and grip style. The mouse would have a flexible, 3D-printed body that molds to the user's hand, providing optimal comfort and support. The mouse would also adjust its size and shape to accommodate different hand sizes and grip preferences. This could be achieved through a combination of sensors and AI-powered algorithms that learn the user's preferences over time.",
    "**Haptic Feedback Explorer**: Create a computer mouse that simulates the sensation of touch and texture, allowing users to explore virtual environments in a more immersive way. The mouse would use advanced haptic technology to recreate the feel of different surfaces, from rough stone to smooth glass. This could be particularly useful for applications like virtual reality, gaming, and even education.",
    "**Biometric Feedback Interface**: Design a computer mouse that uses biometric sensors to track the user's physiological responses, such as heart rate, skin conductance, and brain activity. This data could be used to create a more intuitive and responsive user interface, where the mouse adjusts its behavior based on the user's emotional state. For example, if the user is feeling stressed, the mouse could adjust its sensitivity and speed to help them relax.",
    "**Augmented Reality Navigator**: Develop a computer mouse that uses augmented reality (AR) technology to provide users with a more immersive and interactive experience. The mouse would project virtual buttons, menus, and other interface elements onto the user's workspace, allowing them to interact with virtual objects in 3D space. This could revolutionize the way we interact with computers, making it feel more like a natural extension of our bodies.",
    "**Brain-Computer Interface**: Create a computer mouse that uses electroencephalography (EEG) sensors to read the user's brain activity and translate it into computer input. This would allow users to control the mouse with their thoughts, using techniques like brain-computer interfaces (BCIs) to navigate and interact with digital content. This technology has the potential to revolutionize the way people with disabilities interact with computers, and could also enable new forms of creative expression and collaboration."
