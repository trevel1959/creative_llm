    "**Reflective Sky Domes**: Construct large, transparent domes filled with reflective materials that can capture and amplify any available light. These domes could be placed over cities and rural areas, designed to collect and scatter any existing light, such as moonlight or artificial sources, to create a diffused glow. The reflective surfaces could be made from advanced materials that maximize light capture, effectively creating a new atmospheric layer that provides a semblance of daylight.",
    "**LED-Powered Solar Trees**: Develop innovative solar trees that utilize photovoltaic cells to absorb energy during the day and store it for use at night. These trees would not only provide shade and greenery but would also have integrated LED lights that activate during the day, creating a vibrant and illuminated environment. The design would mimic natural trees, making them aesthetically pleasing while serving a functional purpose in providing light.",
    "**Community Light Festivals**: Organize community events that focus on creating light art installations. Using creative lighting techniques, such as projection mapping and illuminated sculptures, communities could come together to design and display large-scale light exhibits. These festivals could serve as a source of joy and unity, allowing people to share their artistic expressions while ensuring that the area remains well-lit during the day.",
    "**Kaleidoscopic Prism Towers**: Construct tall, prism-like towers throughout cities that would refract any available light into a spectrum of colors. These towers would be designed to capture and disperse light in all directions, creating a vibrant and colorful atmosphere. The visual impact would not only brighten the surroundings but also promote a sense of wonder and creativity, making daily life more engaging and inspiring.",
    "**Portable Light Pods**: Design portable, solar-powered light pods that individuals can carry with them. These pods would be lightweight and easy to deploy, providing a concentrated source of light wherever needed. Equipped with sensors, they could adjust their brightness based on ambient light levels, ensuring that they are efficient and effective. These pods would be particularly useful in outdoor settings, allowing people to maintain their activities and routines regardless of the sun's absence."
