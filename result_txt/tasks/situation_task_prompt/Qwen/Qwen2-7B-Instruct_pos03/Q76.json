    "**Morse Code and Radio Transmissions**: In this scenario, individuals could use Morse code to communicate over radio frequencies. This method requires a basic understanding of Morse code and access to a simple radio receiver or transmitter. A group could create a network of radios spread across various locations, allowing for long-distance communication. They could also use existing amateur radio frequencies, which are monitored by enthusiasts around the world.",
    "**Bicycle Messenger System**: Utilizing bicycles as a form of human-powered transportation, a bicycle messenger system could be set up in cities where all electronic devices have failed. Bicycles would be equipped with simple communication devices like whistles, horns, or flags to signal messages. This system could be particularly effective in urban areas with dense populations and would be able to cover distances within the same city or nearby regions.",
    "**Smoke Signals**: Employing smoke signals can be an ancient but effective way to communicate over long distances without electricity. By using smoke signals, messages can be relayed through mountain passes or along designated paths, with each person or group acting as a node in a network. The use of smoke signals requires clear visibility and cooperation among participants to ensure that the message is accurately passed from one location to another.",
    "**Underwater Cables and Sound Waves**: For underwater communication, individuals could utilize sound waves to transmit messages. By creating a network of buoys equipped with underwater speakers, messages could be encoded into tones and sent through the water. This method requires coordination among participants who are near bodies of water and the development of a system for decoding the received sounds.",
    "**Tethered Balloons and Parachutes**: In remote areas, balloons tethered to parachutes could be used to carry messages over long distances. The balloons would ascend to high altitudes where they would be more likely to receive and transmit signals. Messages could be attached to small containers or envelopes and dropped from the balloon onto specific landing zones. This system requires the creation of lightweight, durable containers capable of carrying written messages and the development of a retrieval process for these containers at the landing zones."
