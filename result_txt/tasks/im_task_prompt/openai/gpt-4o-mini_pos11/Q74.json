    "**Adjustable Nozzle Design**: Create a watering can with an adjustable nozzle that allows users to switch between different spray patterns (e.g., mist, shower, or stream). This feature would enable gardeners to cater the watering method to the specific needs of different plants, ensuring gentle watering for seedlings and more forceful streams for established plants.",
    "**Ergonomic Grip and Lightweight Materials**: Redesign the handle and body of the watering can using lightweight, durable materials such as high-density polyethylene or recycled plastics. Additionally, incorporate an ergonomic grip that reduces strain on the hands and wrists during use. This would make it easier for users to carry and pour water, especially for larger cans.",
    "**Self-Watering Feature**: Introduce a self-watering mechanism that includes a reservoir at the base of the can. This reservoir can hold excess water that drains from the main compartment, allowing plants to absorb moisture gradually through capillary action. This feature would be particularly beneficial for busy gardeners or during hot summer months.",
    "**Built-in Fertilizer Dispenser**: Incorporate a compartment within the watering can that holds granular fertilizers. When watering, users can turn a dial to release a measured amount of fertilizer into the water. This dual-function can simplify the gardening process by ensuring plants receive both water and nutrients simultaneously.",
    "**Color-Coded Water Level Indicator**: Add a transparent strip or a color-coded indicator on the side of the watering can to show the current water level. This feature would allow users to quickly assess how much water is left without having to lift the can or peer inside, making it easier to manage watering tasks efficiently."
