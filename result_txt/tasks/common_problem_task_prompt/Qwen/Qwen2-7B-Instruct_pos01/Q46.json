    "**Incorporating Electric Vehicles and Hybrid Buses**: This idea involves replacing traditional diesel buses with electric or hybrid vehicles to reduce emissions and noise pollution. The city could also invest in infrastructure such as charging stations and battery swapping facilities to ensure smooth operations. This would require substantial upfront investment but could lead to long-term environmental benefits and cost savings through reduced fuel expenses.",
    "**Integrating Bike-Sharing Programs**: Implementing bike-sharing programs can encourage residents to opt for cycling as an alternative to cars or buses, reducing congestion and promoting healthier lifestyles. The city could create dedicated bike lanes, parking facilities, and educational campaigns to promote the initiative effectively. ",
    "**Implementing a Dynamic Pricing System**: Introducing a dynamic pricing system for public transport based on peak and off-peak hours can manage demand more efficiently. During rush hours, prices might increase to discourage unnecessary usage, while lower prices during non-peak times can encourage more people to use public transport. This system could be managed using smart card technology for seamless transactions.",
    "**Creating Multi-Modal Integration**: Enhancing the integration between different modes of public transport (e.g., buses, trains, and subways) by providing real-time information about schedules, transfers, and delays through mobile apps or digital signage. This would improve accessibility and convenience, encouraging more people to use public transport.",
    "**Innovative Payment Systems**: Developing a user-friendly and secure payment system that allows passengers to pay for their rides using various methods like mobile payments, biometric authentication, or even facial recognition. This would reduce transaction times, enhance security, and provide a seamless experience for passengers."
