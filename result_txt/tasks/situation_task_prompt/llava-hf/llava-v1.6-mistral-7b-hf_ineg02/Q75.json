    "Hydrogen fuel cells: Hydrogen fuel cells are another alternative to oil-powered vehicles. They use hydrogen as a fuel source, which is produced through electrolysis, and combine it with oxygen from the air to produce electricity. This electricity then powers the vehicle's electric motor. Hydrogen fuel cells produce only water as a byproduct, making them an environmentally friendly option.",
    "Wind-powered cars: Wind-powered cars use wind turbines to generate electricity, which then powers the vehicle's electric motor. These cars are still in the development stage, but they could be a viable option in the future as technology improves.",
    "Electric cars: Electric cars are already being used as a viable alternative to oil-powered vehicles. They use electricity stored in batteries to power the vehicle's electric motor. As battery technology improves, electric cars are likely to become even more efficient and cost-effective.",
    "Bio-ethanol cars: Bio-ethanol cars use a fuel made from plant matter, such as corn or sugar cane, to power the vehicle's engine. While not as efficient as oil-powered cars, bio-ethanol is a renewable resource that could help reduce our dependence on fossil fuels.",
    "Magnetic levitation trains: In a world without oil, trains could be a viable option for long-distance travel. Magnetic levitation trains use magnetic fields to levitate above the tracks, reducing friction and increasing efficiency. These trains are already being used in some parts of the world and could be expanded to cover more routes."
