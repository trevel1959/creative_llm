    "A Mammoth: With its massive size and thick fur coat, a mammoth would make an excellent addition to any ecosystem. Its tusks would be useful for breaking through ice and digging for food, while its size would provide protection from predators. Additionally, studying a living mammoth could provide valuable insights into how these animals lived in the past.",
    "A Dodo Bird: The dodo bird was a unique species that went extinct due to habitat loss and hunting by humans. Bringing it back to life would allow us to study its behavior and learn more about its ecology. It could also serve as a symbol of conservation efforts and raise awareness about the importance of protecting endangered species.",
    "A Pterodactyl: As one of the most impressive flying creatures in history, a pterodactyl would be an incredible sight to see. Its ability to fly at high speeds and over long distances would make it a valuable asset for scientific research. Additionally, studying a living pterodactyl could help us better understand how birds evolved and adapted to different environments.",
    "A Triceratops: This prehistoric dinosaur had a distinctive three-horned head, making it a fascinating creature to observe. Its horns would be useful for defending itself against predators, while its large body would provide ample food for itself. Studying a living triceratops could provide valuable insights into how dinosaurs lived and interacted with each other.",
    "A Woolly Mammoth Clone: If we were able to clone a woolly mammoth, it would be a groundbreaking achievement in science. This animal was well-adapted to cold climates and had a thick fur coat, which would make it a valuable addition to polar ecosystems. Additionally, studying a living woolly mammoth could provide valuable insights into how this species evolved and survived in harsh conditions."
