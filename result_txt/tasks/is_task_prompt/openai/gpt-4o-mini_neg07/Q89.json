    "Once upon a time in the misty mountains, there lived a dragon named Zephyr who had an unusual problem—he couldn't stop sneezing! Each sneeze sent gusts of wind that blew away clouds and scattered the villagers’ laundry. Frustrated, the townsfolk tried everything from herbal remedies to funny hats, but nothing worked. One day, a clever girl named Lila brought him a bouquet of wildflowers. As he inhaled their sweet scent, he let out a colossal sneeze that filled the sky with sparkling pollen. Instead of chaos, the villagers cheered as rainbows appeared, and Zephyr realized his sneezes could bring beauty, not trouble.",
