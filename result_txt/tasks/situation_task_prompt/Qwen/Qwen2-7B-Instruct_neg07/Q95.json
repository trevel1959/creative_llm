    "**Inflatable Pillow Alternative**: Design an inflatable pillow that can be filled with air or water to provide a comfortable cushion for your head. The user could inflate it to their desired firmness before bed, and then deflate it during the day for easy storage. It could be made of durable materials to withstand wear and tear.",
    "**Memory Foam Head Rest**: Create a headrest that utilizes memory foam technology. The foam adapts to the shape of your head, providing a custom fit every night. This headrest could be attached to the edge of the bed or be portable, allowing you to use it on any surface for a comfortable sleep.",
    "**Flexible Wire Frame Pillow**: Develop a pillow that has a wire frame at its core, which can be bent into various shapes to conform to different sleeping positions. This could include an S-shape for side sleepers, a U-shape for back sleepers, or a flat oval for stomach sleepers. The outside could be covered in a soft material like fleece or cotton for comfort.",
    "**Water-Based Cooling Pillow**: Design a pillow that uses water as its cooling agent. The pillow would contain a reservoir of water within its structure, and a pump or mechanism would allow users to fill or empty the water based on their needs. This could help regulate body temperature, especially in warmer climates.",
    "**Ergonomic Pillow with Adjustable Height**: Create a pillow that adjusts its height based on the sleeper's preferences or changes throughout the night. It could feature a hollow center that can be filled with air or small weights, allowing the user to change the height by adding or removing components. This could help reduce neck pain and improve overall sleep quality. "
