    "Virtual Reality Enhancement Glasses: Developers could create virtual reality enhancement glasses that use augmented reality technology to simulate a world with perfect vision. These glasses would project a digital image of the world onto the wearer's retina, effectively replacing the need for glasses or contact lenses.",
    "Bionic Eye Implants: Scientists could develop bionic eye implants that bypass the damaged parts of the eye and directly stimulate the brain's visual centers. These implants could provide a range of vision, from basic light detection to high-resolution color vision.",
    "Brain-Computer Interfaces: Researchers could develop brain-computer interfaces that allow people with poor vision to control electronic devices with their thoughts. These interfaces would read brain signals and translate them into commands for devices such as smartphones, tablets, or even prosthetic limbs.",
    "Artificial Retina Implants: Engineers could develop artificial retina implants that mimic the function of a healthy retina. These implants could be implanted in the eye and stimulate the retina directly, providing a range of vision, including color and peripheral vision.",
    "Genetic Engineering: Scientists could use genetic engineering to correct genetic defects that cause vision problems. By identifying the genetic causes of poor vision and modifying the genes responsible, researchers could potentially cure or significantly improve vision in individuals."
