    "**Integrated Mosquito Netting**: Design a sleeping bag with a built-in, retractable mosquito net that can be easily deployed when needed. The net would be made from lightweight, breathable material and could be tucked away into a dedicated pocket when not in use. This feature would enhance comfort and protection against insects during camping trips in nature.",
    "**Self-Inflating Pillow Compartment**: Create a sleeping bag with an integrated self-inflating pillow compartment. This would allow campers to enjoy a comfortable headrest without needing to carry an extra pillow. The compartment would have a valve system to allow air to flow in and out, ensuring the pillow inflates to the desired firmness with minimal effort.",
    "**Multi-Functional Zipper System**: Innovate a sleeping bag with a multi-functional zipper system that allows it to transform into various forms. For example, it could unzip completely to become a blanket, or zip together with another sleeping bag to accommodate two people. This versatility would cater to different camping scenarios and personal preferences.",
    "**Built-In Charging Port**: Incorporate a solar panel and USB charging port into the sleeping bag design. This would allow campers to charge their devices while they sleep. The solar panel could be removable for easy cleaning, and the charging port would be located in a convenient spot, providing a practical solution for tech-savvy outdoor enthusiasts.",
    "**Personalized Comfort Zones**: Create a sleeping bag that features adjustable sections with varying levels of insulation. Campers could customize the warmth of different areas (e.g., more insulation around the feet and less around the torso) based on their personal comfort preferences. This would allow for a tailored sleeping experience that can accommodate different body types and sleeping styles."
