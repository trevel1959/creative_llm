    "Use a ladder or rope to climb to the top of the building",
    "Create a makeshift zip line using materials from the building",
    "Try to find an alternate entrance to the building that is still functioning",
    "Ask for help from other people in the building who may have access to another elevator or stairwell",
    "Utilize your knowledge of physics and engineering to create a homemade pulley system to lift yourself up to the top of the building. For example, by attaching a rope to a heavy object and then using it to pull oneself up the side of the building. This idea requires a high level of skill and expertise in physics and engineering, but could potentially be a feasible solution in certain situations."
