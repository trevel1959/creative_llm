The grill would allow you to cook food over an open flame, without the need for any electricity or fuel. This idea would require some basic DIY skills and access to materials, but it could be a reliable way to cook meals in a post-apocalyptic world. I would give myself a confidence score of 0.7 for this idea.",
    "Food Dehydrator: Build a food dehydrator using a cardboard box, plastic wrap, and a fan. The dehydrator would allow you to preserve food by removing the moisture, making it easier to store and transport. This idea would require some basic DIY skills and access to materials, but it could be a reliable way to preserve food in a post-apocalyptic"
