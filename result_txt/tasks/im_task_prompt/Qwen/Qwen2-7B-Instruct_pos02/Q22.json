    "**Innovative LED Flashlight Design**: Create a flashlight that not only serves as a traditional lighting tool but also doubles as a power bank for charging electronic devices like smartphones or tablets. The design could include a USB port on the side, allowing users to charge their devices while on-the-go. This would be particularly useful for outdoor enthusiasts, emergency situations, or people who work in remote areas.",
    "**Solar-Powered Flashlight**: Develop a flashlight that incorporates solar panels into its design, making it self-sufficient in terms of energy. It could have a rechargeable battery inside that gets charged by sunlight during the day. This innovation is highly beneficial for camping trips, rural areas where access to electricity is limited, or for use in natural disaster relief efforts.",
    "**Smart Flashlight with Voice Commands**: Integrate voice recognition technology into a flashlight. Users can issue commands through voice (like \"turn on\", \"increase brightness\", \"set timer\") which makes it more convenient for one-handed use, especially in dark environments. This could be particularly useful for people with visual impairments or those working in hazardous conditions where hands-free operation is necessary.",
    "**Multi-Functional Emergency Light**: Beyond just being a flashlight, this device could double up as a beacon, a radio, or even a small first aid kit. For instance, the flashlight could have an integrated whistle, a mirror for signaling, and a whistle that can be used as a compass. This all-in-one solution is incredibly valuable for emergency preparedness kits, military personnel, and explorers.",
    "**Waterproof and Durable Flashlight for Professional Use**: Develop a flashlight specifically designed for professional use in industries such as construction, police, fire services, or marine operations. This flashlight should be completely waterproof, shockproof, and dustproof, ensuring reliability under extreme conditions. Additionally, it could feature features like high-intensity beams, adjustable focus, and multiple light modes (e.g., white, red, and infrared) to suit various tasks. "
