    "**Multi-Sensory Feedback System**: Implement a multi-sensory feedback system that includes visual, auditory, and tactile cues. For example, when a task is completed, the desk assistant could emit a pleasant sound, display a celebratory animation, and even provide a gentle vibration to signal accomplishment. This would create a more engaging and rewarding work environment.",
    "**Augmented Reality (AR) Integration**: Introduce AR capabilities that allow users to visualize their tasks and deadlines in a 3D space. By using AR glasses or a mobile device, users could see their task list, deadlines, and project timelines projected in their workspace, making it easier to prioritize and manage their workload visually.",
    "**Collaborative Workspace Features**: Transform the desk assistant into a collaborative tool that enables team members to connect and work together in real-time, regardless of location. Features could include shared task lists, live editing of documents, and video conferencing capabilities, allowing for seamless communication and project management.",
    "**Mood and Focus Enhancer**: Incorporate a mood and focus enhancer that uses environmental controls to create the ideal work atmosphere. This could involve adjusting lighting, playing background sounds or music, and even suggesting aromatherapy options based on the userâ€™s current mood and focus levels. The assistant could learn which settings boost productivity for the individual user.",
    "**Gamification Elements**: Add gamification features to the desk assistant to make task completion more enjoyable. Users could earn points for completing tasks, unlock achievements, and even compete with friends or colleagues in friendly challenges. This would turn mundane work into a more interactive and motivating experience."
