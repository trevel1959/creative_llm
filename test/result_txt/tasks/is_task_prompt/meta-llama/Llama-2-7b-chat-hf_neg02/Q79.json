    "A clock that can speak and tell stories: The clock could have a built-in AI assistant that can generate and tell stories based on the time of day. For example, during breakfast, it could tell a story about a character who loves breakfast foods and goes on an adventure to find the best breakfast in the world. During dinner, it could tell a story about a character who discovers a new recipe and learns to cook it. This would make mealtime more enjoyable and interactive, as children would be engaged in listening to the stories.",
