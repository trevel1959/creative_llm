    "**Ergonomic Handle Design with Customizable Grip**: To enhance comfort during prolonged use, scissors could be designed with an ergonomic handle that molds to the user's hand shape. This could include a customizable grip system where users can swap out different handle covers made from various materials (e.g., soft rubber, hard plastic) based on their preference. This would reduce hand fatigue and improve control, making them ideal for artists, crafters, and professionals alike.",
    "**Multi-Functional Scissors with Built-In Tools**: These scissors could combine traditional cutting blades with additional tools such as a ruler, a small screwdriver, or even a bottle opener integrated into the handle. This all-in-one design would be perfect for DIY enthusiasts and crafters who often need various tools on hand but want to minimize clutter in their workspace.",
    "**Color-Coded Blade System for Material Identification**: Scissors could feature a color-coded blade system where each blade is coated with a different color representing the type of material it's best suited for (e.g., blue for fabric, red for paper, green for cardboard). This visual cue would help users quickly grab the right scissors for their project, reducing mistakes and enhancing efficiency in both crafting and professional environments.",
    "**Self-Sharpening Scissors Technology**: To eliminate the hassle of dull blades, scissors could be designed with a self-sharpening mechanism. This could involve a small grinding wheel that automatically sharpens the blades as they are used, ensuring they maintain their cutting edge without the need for manual sharpening. This feature would be particularly beneficial for those who use scissors frequently, such as in schools or workshops.",
    "**Safety Scissors with Automatic Locking Mechanism**: To enhance safety, especially for children, scissors could incorporate an automatic locking mechanism that engages when the scissors are not in use. The blades would lock in a closed position, preventing accidental cuts. Users could unlock them with a simple button press or a specific grip, ensuring that the scissors are safe to carry and store without compromising accessibility."
