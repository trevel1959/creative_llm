    "The \"Evolving Robot\": This robot is designed to learn and adapt to its environment, much like a living organism. It has sensors that detect changes in its surroundings and uses this information to modify its own structure and function. For example, if the robot finds itself in a dark room, it could grow longer limbs to better navigate the space.",
    "The \"Nature-Inspired Robot\": This robot is designed to mimic the forms and functions of natural organisms. It has a body that resembles a leaf or a branch, allowing it to blend in with its surroundings and sneak up on its targets. It also has the ability to change color and texture to match its environment, making it nearly invisible.",
    "The \"Reconfigurable Robot\": This robot is made up of interchangeable modules that can be combined and rearranged to create different forms and functions. For example, the robot could start as a simple body with two arms and a single leg, but then add additional limbs and sensors as needed. This allows the robot to adapt to different tasks and environments without the need for extensive redesign.",
    "The \"Symbiotic Robot\": This robot is designed to work in tandem with other living organisms, such as plants or animals. It has specialized sensors that allow it to communicate with these organisms and coordinate its actions with theirs. For example, the robot could work with a plant to create a hybrid system that harnesses the energy of the sun and the soil to power its own functions.",
    "The \"Morphing Robot\": This robot is designed to change its shape and form in real-time, allowing it to adapt to different situations and environments. It has specialized actuators that allow it to change its shape by manipulating its internal structure, much like a liquid changing shape in a mold. This allows the robot to transform into different forms, such as a spider-like robot that can crawl through tight spaces or a flying robot that can soar through the air."
