    "**Monitoring Atmospheric Pressure and Humidity**: In a world without clouds, changes in atmospheric pressure and humidity could be key indicators of the weather. For example, a drop in atmospheric pressure might indicate an incoming low-pressure system, which can bring warmer temperatures or even storms. Similarly, increased humidity levels could suggest the approach of a humid front that might lead to heavy rain.",
    "**Utilizing Solar Radiation**: The intensity of sunlight could also serve as a predictor of weather conditions. High solar radiation typically signifies clear skies and potentially hotter temperatures, while a decrease in solar radiation might suggest cloud cover is moving in, bringing cooler temperatures and possibly precipitation.",
    "**Sensing Wind Patterns**: Wind direction and speed can provide clues about weather patterns. A sudden change in wind direction, for instance, could indicate an approaching storm system. Additionally, the absence of clouds might affect wind patterns, making them easier to track and predict weather changes.",
    "**Monitoring Ocean Surface Temperatures and Currents**: In coastal areas, changes in ocean surface temperatures and currents could indicate potential weather shifts. Warmer water might suggest the presence of warm fronts leading to warmer weather, while cold water could point to colder conditions or even the development of storms.",
    "**Infrared Imaging and Thermal Sensors**: Without the natural insulation provided by clouds, the Earth's surface would likely experience more extreme temperature fluctuations. Infrared imaging technology could be used to monitor these temperature changes, helping predict weather conditions. For example, a rapid cooling of the land at night could indicate the approach of a cold front, while warming temperatures might suggest a heat wave or a developing storm."
