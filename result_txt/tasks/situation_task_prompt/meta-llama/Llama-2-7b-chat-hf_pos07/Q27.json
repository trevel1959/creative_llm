    "Greenhouse-Inspired Insulation: Utilize the natural insulation properties of plants to regulate indoor temperature. Install vertical gardens or green walls in strategic locations throughout the building, allowing them to absorb and release heat as needed. This method mimics the natural insulation provided by Earth's atmosphere, providing a sustainable and eco-friendly solution.",
    "Thermal Mass Storage: Utilize heavy, dense materials like concrete or brick to absorb and store heat during warmer periods, releasing it during cooler periods. This method takes advantage of the material's thermal mass, allowing it to act as a heat sink, maintaining a consistent indoor temperature.",
    "Evaporative Cooling: Harness the power of evaporation to cool the indoor space. Install a series of evaporative cooling pads or misting systems throughout the building, which absorb heat from the air and release it as water vapor. This method is highly efficient, especially in dry climates, and can provide a cost-effective alternative to traditional cooling methods.",
    "Passive Solar Design: Optimize the building's design to take advantage of natural solar gain during colder periods and minimize it during warmer periods. This can be achieved through strategic window placement, aperture size, and orientation. By controlling the amount of sunlight entering the building, a more consistent indoor temperature can be maintained.",
    "Radiant Floor Heating: Install a network of pipes under the floor to circulate a heated fluid, providing warmth to the space through radiation. This method is highly efficient, as it directly heats the space without losing heat through convection or radiation. Additionally, it can be powered by renewable energy sources like solar or geothermal, making it a sustainable option."
