    "Innovative Flashlight Design: Create a flashlight with a unique design that incorporates a built-in magnifying glass or lens, allowing users to illuminate and examine small objects or details in their surroundings. This could be particularly useful for campers, hikers, or first responders who need to inspect small areas or objects in low-light conditions.",
    "Smart Flashlight App: Develop an app that connects to a flashlight and provides additional features such as a built-in compass, weather forecast, or even a virtual tour guide for outdoor enthusiasts. This app could also include a community feature, allowing users to share their experiences and tips with others.",
    "Portable Power Bank: Design a flashlight that doubles as a portable power bank, allowing users to charge their devices on the go. This could be particularly useful for travelers or outdoor enthusiasts who need to keep their devices charged while away from a power source.",
    "Augmented Reality Flashlight: Develop a flashlight that incorporates augmented reality (AR) technology, allowing users to see virtual objects or information superimposed onto their surroundings. This could be useful for outdoor activities such as hiking or camping, where users can use the flashlight to identify plants, animals, or other objects in their environment.",
    "Solar-Powered Flashlight: Create a flashlight that runs on solar power, eliminating the need for batteries or charging. This could be particularly useful for outdoor enthusiasts who spend extended periods of time in remote areas without access to a power source. The flashlight could also be designed with a built-in solar panel to charge other devices, such as a phone or portable power bank."
