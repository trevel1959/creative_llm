    "Dream manipulation: With the ability to control dreams, individuals could manipulate their subconscious mind to create dreamscapes that are more desirable. They could control the emotions, settings, and characters in their dreams, allowing them to overcome fears or anxieties in a controlled environment. This could also be used to relive happy memories or to explore new ideas and experiences.",
    "Nightmares as a warning: If dream control was possible, nightmares could serve as a warning system for the subconscious mind. Dreams could be used to signal potential problems or dangers in a person's waking life, allowing them to take preventative measures before they become a reality. This could help individuals avoid accidents, health problems, or other negative events.",
    "Dream therapy: With the ability to control dreams, therapists could use dreams as a tool for healing and personal growth. They could work with clients to identify and address underlying issues in their subconscious mind, helping them to overcome psychological or emotional problems. This could be particularly useful for individuals struggling with anxiety, depression, or post-traumatic stress disorder.",
    "Dream travel: If dream control was possible, individuals could use their dreams to travel to different places and experiences. They could visit new environments, meet new people, and explore new ideas and cultures. This could be a way to broaden one's horizons and gain new insights without leaving the comfort of their own home.",
    "Collective dreaming: With the ability to control dreams, groups of people could share dreams and work together to solve problems or create new ideas. This could be a way for people to collaborate and problem-solve in a more creative and intuitive way, drawing on the collective subconscious of the group. This could be particularly useful for brainstorming or solving complex problems that require a fresh perspective."
