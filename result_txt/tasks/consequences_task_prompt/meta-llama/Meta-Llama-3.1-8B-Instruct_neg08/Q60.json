    "**The Rise of Virtual Assistants**: With the internet as a basic human right, virtual assistants become ubiquitous, revolutionizing the way people live and work.

    "**New Forms of Governance and Social Contracts**: As the internet becomes a basic human right, new forms of governance and social contracts emerge to regulate its use and ensure its equitable distribution. This could lead to the creation of decentralized, blockchain-based systems that prioritize transparency, accountability, and community involvement. However, this also raises questions about the role of governments, the balance between individual rights and collective responsibilities, and the potential for social unrest.",
    "**The Redefinition of Work and Leisure**: With the internet as a fundamental right, traditional notions of work and leisure are turned upside down.
