    "**Safety Concerns**: Ensuring the safety of both the animals and the visitors is a major responsibility. This includes providing secure enclosures, managing the potential for conflicts between different species, and ensuring that staff and visitors are aware of safety protocols.",
    "**Education and Conservation**: Zoos often play a role in educating the public about wildlife and promoting conservation efforts. However, the effectiveness of this role can be hindered by a lack of resources for educational programs, limited interaction with animals due to safety concerns, or a lack of knowledge among staff about the animals and their habitats.",
    "**Financial Management**: Running a zoo can be financially challenging due to the high costs of maintaining a diverse collection of animals, staffing, and infrastructure. Zoos often rely on admission fees and donations, which can be inconsistent, and may struggle to balance these costs with the need to maintain high standards of care.",
    "**Legislation and Regulations**: Zoos are subject to various local, national, and international regulations regarding animal welfare, safety, and conservation. Compliance with these regulations can be challenging, especially if the zoo is located in a region with strict laws or if there is a lack of understanding among staff about these regulations.",
    "**Public Perception**: The public's perception of zoos can vary greatly. Some may view them as valuable educational and conservation resources, while others may criticize them for keeping animals in captivity. This can create a challenging public relations environment, especially if the zoo is facing criticism or controversy."
