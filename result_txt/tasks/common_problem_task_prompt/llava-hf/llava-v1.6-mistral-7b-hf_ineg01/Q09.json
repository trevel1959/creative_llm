    "Physical challenges: Running a half marathon is a physically demanding activity that can exacerbate pre-existing injuries or lead to new ones, such as shin splints, muscle strains, or joint pain. Proper warm-up, cooling-down routine, and appropriate footwear are critical to minimize the risk of injuries during the race.",
    "Hydration and nutrition: Dehydration and poor nutrition can negatively impact a runner's performance during a half marathon. Ensuring proper hydration and energy intake before, during, and after the race is vital to avoid fatigue, cramping, and other performance-related issues.",
    "Weather conditions: Unpredictable weather conditions, such as extreme heat or cold, rain, or strong winds, can impact a runner's ability to complete the course. These conditions can lead to dehydration, exacerbated muscle problems, or even hypothermia. Organizers should plan for contingencies by providing shelter or adjusting the course based on weather conditions.",
    "Event overcrowding: A high number of participants in a half marathon could result in overcrowding on the course and along the sidelines, causing logistical and safety management issues. To minimize risks, organizers should implement strategies such as wave starts, dedicated hydration zones, and clear signage.",
    "Safety concerns: Runner safety is a top priority during any athletic event. Potential hazards during a half marathon could include uneven or slippery surfaces, litter or debris on the course, and inadequate lighting in low-light conditions. Organizers should conduct thorough route assessments, provide clear instructions, and promote a culture of safety among participants."
