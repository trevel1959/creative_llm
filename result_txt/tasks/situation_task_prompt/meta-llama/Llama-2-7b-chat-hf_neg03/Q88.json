    "Airships: In a world where all roads become impassable, airships could become the primary mode of transportation. These massive, lighter-than-air vessels could be powered by steam or electricity and offer a safe and comfortable way to traverse long distances. With their ability to navigate through the air, airships could transport people and goods between cities, states, or even countries.",
    "Maglev Trains: Magnetic levitation trains, or maglev trains, could be an alternative mode of transportation in a world where roads are impassable. These trains use magnetic fields to lift and propel trains, eliminating the need for wheels and tracks. This would make them more efficient and reliable, even in the face of unstable terrain. Maglev trains could be powered by electricity or other sustainable energy sources, reducing their environmental impact.",
    "Submersibles: Submersibles could become the primary mode of transportation in a world where roads are impassable. These underwater vessels could be used to travel between coastal cities or even across oceans. Submersibles could be powered by electric or diesel engines, and some could even be equipped with advanced technology like submersible airplanes. This would allow for fast and efficient travel over long distances.",
    "Spaceflight: In a world where all roads are impassable, spaceflight could become a viable mode of transportation. With the development of reusable rockets and spacecraft, traveling to other planets or even orbiting the Earth could become a realistic option. While this mode of transportation may not be practical for short distances, it could offer a reliable and efficient way to travel long distances.",
    "Hoverbikes: Hoverbikes, also known as hovercycles or hoverbikes, could become a popular mode of transportation in a world where roads are impassable. These vehicles use fans or rotors to create lift and propulsion, allowing them to hover above the ground. Hoverbikes could be powered by electricity or gasoline, and they could offer a fun and exciting way to travel short distances. They could also be used for recreational purposes, such as racing or stunts."
