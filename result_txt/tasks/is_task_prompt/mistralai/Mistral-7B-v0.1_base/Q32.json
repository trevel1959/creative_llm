    "The ice cream was falling down, but it was not actually raining. It was just ice cream, falling out of the sky. It was a strange and wonderful place to be.",
    "The rain was cold and it was hard to taste. The smell of the rain was different. It smelled like old fish, and the ice cream was not very good either.",
    "It was like a storm that passed through the sky. The clouds went black, and it was raining everywhere. It was wet and cold, but then it became hot. The ice cream was delicious and it made people happy.",
    "The rain was falling down. The rain was ice cream. It was cold and delicious, and it was falling down.",
    "The ice cream was like a tornado. It was spinning around in the air, but it was not actually falling. The ice cream was frozen and it was falling down."
