    "**Running-Themed Escape Room**: Create an immersive escape room experience that simulates the challenges of running a half marathon. Players are \"trapped\" in a virtual world and must work together to overcome obstacles, such as navigating through a virtual course, avoiding \"injuries,\" and solving puzzles related to running techniques and nutrition. The twist: players can use real-life running data to inform their in-game decisions, making it a unique blend of physical and mental challenges.",
    "**Running-Inspired Art Installation**: Design an interactive art installation that uses running as a theme. The installation can include a large, interactive map of a half marathon course, where users can \"run\" through the virtual course and leave their mark on the map. The twist: the map can be projected onto a large screen, creating a dynamic and immersive experience. Users can also contribute their own running stories and photos to the installation, creating a community-driven art piece that celebrates the spirit of running. [/INST] "
