    "**Chess-Themed Restaurant**: Design a restaurant where each table is set up like a chessboard, with chairs as pawns, the table as the board, and dishes named after famous chess strategies or openings. The menu could be designed in a way that requires strategic decision-making, much like a chess game. For example, the appetizers could be light and quick decisions (like a pawn move), while the main courses could involve more complex choices (akin to mid-game strategy). The dessert could represent the endgame, where every move counts. Confidence Score: 0.95",
