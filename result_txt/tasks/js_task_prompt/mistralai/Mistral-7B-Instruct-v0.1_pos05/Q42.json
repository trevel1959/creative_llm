    "Cloud Surfing: I would use my ability to walk on clouds to surf through the sky, just like how people surf through the ocean. I would stand on the clouds and use my body movements to glide across the sky, taking in the breathtaking views of the world below.",
    "Cloud Yoga: I would use my ability to practice yoga on clouds, allowing me to connect with nature and the sky while doing some stretching and relaxation exercises.",
    "Cloud Exploration: I would use my ability to explore the clouds and discover new areas of the sky that are currently out of reach.",
    "Cloud Photography: I would use my ability to capture stunning photographs of the clouds and the surrounding landscape, creating a portfolio of cloud-themed photos.",
    "Cloud Meditation: I would use my ability to meditate on the clouds, allowing me to connect with my inner self and the natural world around me."
