    "**Solar-Powered Sailboat**: Design a sailboat with a unique, retractable solar panel system that harnesses the sun's energy to power a high-efficiency propulsion system. This would allow the sailboat to travel longer distances without relying on traditional fossil fuels, reducing carbon emissions and promoting sustainability. (Confidence score: 0.8)",
    "**Autonomous Navigation System**: Develop an advanced AI-powered navigation system that uses machine learning algorithms to predict and adapt to changing weather patterns, ocean currents, and other environmental factors. This system would enable the sailboat to navigate through the Atlantic with increased safety and efficiency, minimizing the risk of human error. (Confidence score: 0.9)",
    "**Hydrofoil-Assisted Sailboat**: Create a sailboat with a hydrofoil system that allows it to glide above the water's surface, reducing drag and increasing speed. This would enable the sailboat to cover longer distances in a shorter amount of time, while also providing a smoother ride for passengers. (Confidence score: 0.7)",
    "**Underwater Exploration Module**: Design a detachable, submersible module that can be deployed from the sailboat to explore the ocean floor and marine life. This module would be equipped with advanced sensors and cameras, allowing sailors to gather valuable data and insights about the ocean's ecosystem. (Confidence score: 0.8)",
    "**Bioluminescent Lighting System**: Develop a sustainable lighting system that harnesses the power of bioluminescent organisms to illuminate the sailboat's surroundings. This would not only reduce energy consumption but also create a unique and enchanting experience for sailors, as they navigate through the dark waters of the Atlantic. (Confidence score: 0.6)"
