    "Smart Sleeping Bag: Create a sleeping bag that monitors the sleeper's vital signs and provides real-time feedback to help them sleep better. The smart sleeping bag could have built-in sensors to track heart rate, breathing patterns, and body temperature. It could also have a built-in alarm system that gently wakes the sleeper during light sleep phases, helping them feel more rested and refreshed upon waking.",
    "Temperature-Control Sleeping Bag: Design a sleeping bag that can adjust its temperature to match the sleeper's body temperature. This could be achieved through the use of thermo-electric cooling or heating pads, or through the use of phase-change materials that absorb and release heat. This would provide a more comfortable sleeping experience, as the sleeper would not feel too hot or too cold throughout the night.",
    "Inflatable Sleeping Bag: Create an inflatable sleeping bag that can be easily deflated and stored in a small space. This would be ideal for backpackers or campers who need to carry a sleeping bag on long trips. The inflatable design would provide extra comfort and support, while the compact size would make it easy to transport.",
    "Solar-Powered Sleeping Bag: Design a sleeping bag with built-in solar panels that can charge electronic devices while the sleeper is sleeping. This would be a great feature for campers who want to stay connected with the outside world without having to carry a separate power source. The solar panels could also provide a convenient way to charge a phone or other devices during the night.",
    "Smart Lightweight Sleeping Bag: Create a lightweight sleeping bag that is also incredibly durable and long-lasting. This could be achieved through the use of advanced materials, such as nanomaterials or advanced composites. The lightweight design would make it easier for campers to carry, while the durability would ensure that the sleeping bag lasts for many years."
