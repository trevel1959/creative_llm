    "**Habitat Maintenance and Enrichment**: Animals in a zoo require environments that mimic their natural habitats to thrive. A common issue is the degradation of these habitats due to wear and tear or insufficient resources for maintenance. Additionally, animals may become bored or stressed without proper enrichment activities. To address this, regular assessments of habitats and innovative enrichment programs can be implemented to ensure the animals remain engaged and healthy.",
    "**Visitor Safety and Experience**: Ensuring the safety of visitors while providing an enjoyable experience is crucial. Problems may arise from overcrowding, inadequate signage, or unsafe viewing areas that could lead to accidents. To improve visitor safety, the zoo can implement crowd control measures, clear signage, and designated viewing platforms that keep visitors at a safe distance from enclosures.",
    "**Staff Training and Retention**: A well-trained staff is essential for the effective operation of a zoo. Issues may arise from high turnover rates, lack of training programs, or insufficient knowledge about animal care and behavior. To combat this, the zoo can invest in ongoing professional development, mentorship programs, and competitive benefits to retain skilled staff and ensure they are well-equipped to handle their responsibilities.",
    "**Sustainability and Conservation Efforts**: Zoos face increasing pressure to operate sustainably and contribute to conservation efforts. A potential problem could be the lack of funding or resources to support these initiatives. To address this, the zoo can develop partnerships with conservation organizations, seek grants, and engage in community outreach programs to raise awareness and support for their conservation efforts.",
    "**Public Relations and Community Engagement**: Negative public perception can significantly impact a zoo's reputation. Issues may arise from animal welfare concerns, controversial practices, or negative media coverage. To improve public relations, the zoo can implement transparency in operations, host open days for the community, and engage in social media campaigns that highlight positive stories about animal care and conservation."
