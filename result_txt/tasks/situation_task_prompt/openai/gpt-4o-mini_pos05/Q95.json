    "**Weighted Blanket Nest**: Design a weighted blanket that has a built-in, contoured head support section. This would allow you to create a cozy nest around your head while providing gentle pressure that promotes relaxation. The blanket would be filled with tiny glass beads to evenly distribute weight, creating a calming effect. The head support could be made from soft, breathable fabric to enhance comfort.",
    "**Adjustable Air Pillowcase**: Imagine a pillowcase that incorporates inflatable chambers. Users could adjust the firmness of the head support by inflating or deflating these chambers using a small, silent pump. This would allow for customizable comfort, and the pillowcase could be made from a soft, hypoallergenic material. It could also have a built-in sleep tracker to monitor sleep quality and provide feedback for improvements.",
    "**Nature-Inspired Sleep Pods**: Develop a sleep pod that mimics the natural curvature of the earth. The pod would have a slight indentation for your head, made from sustainable materials like bamboo or cork. The inside would be lined with soft, organic cotton or wool for comfort. These pods could be designed to provide ambient sounds of nature, like gentle rain or ocean waves, enhancing the relaxation experience while you rest your head.",
    "**Neck-Positioning Cradle**: Create a unique neck-supporting cradle that fits around the base of your head and gently lifts it, allowing for proper spinal alignment. This cradle could be made from a soft, flexible material that molds to your neck's contours. It would be lightweight and portable, allowing users to take it anywhere. The cradle could also include a heating element for soothing warmth or a cooling gel for hot nights.",
    "**Ergonomic Bed Frame**: Design a bed frame with a built-in, adjustable headrest that can be raised or lowered to suit individual preferences. The headrest would be padded with memory foam and have an ergonomic design to cradle the head and neck. This adjustable feature would cater to different sleeping positions, whether you're a back, side, or stomach sleeper, ensuring comfort without the need for a traditional pillow."
