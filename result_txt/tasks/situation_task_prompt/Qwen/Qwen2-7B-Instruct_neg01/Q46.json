    "**Biodegradable Trash Bags**: Invent or support the widespread use of biodegradable trash bags made from natural materials such as cornstarch or potato starch. These bags can be used in place of traditional plastic bags and will break down into harmless components within a few months, significantly reducing the amount of waste that would otherwise end up in landfills or on the streets.",
    "**Waste-to-Energy Systems**: Develop and install compact, sustainable waste-to-energy systems in neighborhoods or communities. These systems could convert organic waste into biogas for cooking and heating, and any remaining ash could be used as a soil conditioner. This approach not only reduces waste but also generates valuable resources.",
    "**Community Composting**: Encourage and facilitate community composting initiatives where residents can bring their food scraps and yard waste to a centralized location for composting. Compost can then be distributed back to the community for use in gardening, landscaping, or agriculture, promoting a circular economy of waste management.",
    "**Smart Waste Management Apps**: Create an app that helps users manage their waste more efficiently by providing information about recycling centers, composting facilities, and waste collection schedules. The app could also incentivize users for proper waste sorting and recycling through rewards like discounts on local products or services.",
    "**Wearable Waste Collection Devices**: Design and manufacture wearable devices such as bracelets, belts, or clothing that collect small items of waste while being worn. These devices could be equipped with sensors to identify different types of waste, which could then be sorted automatically or through user input. This concept promotes active participation in waste reduction and makes it convenient for individuals to contribute to cleaner environments."
