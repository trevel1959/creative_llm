    "Creating a submersible that can to: is a material, is a-based material that is-based,-based material that is-based, and can be used for a variety of applications, including as a structural component in submersibles. By can be-based, and can be used for a variety of applications, including as a structural component in submersibles.",
    "Developing a propulsion system that is efficient and: Propulsion systems are essential for, as they allow the submersible to to. There are various types of propulsion systems, including internal combustion engines, electric motors, and hybrid systems. However, for a mission to the bottom of the ocean, an efficient and effective propulsion system is necessary. One idea is to develop a hybrid system that combines the advantages of both electric and internal combustion engines.",
