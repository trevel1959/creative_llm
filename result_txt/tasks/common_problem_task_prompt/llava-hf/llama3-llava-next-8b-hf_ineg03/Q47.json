    "Difficulty in installation: Installing all the components can be a daunting task, especially for someone who has not done it before. This can lead to difficulties in properly connecting cables and installing drivers, which can result in hardware issues or reduced performance.",
    "Warranty and support: When building a computer from scratch, the warranty and support for the individual components may vary. For example, the motherboard and CPU may have different warranties, and the RAM and storage drive may have different levels of support. This can make it difficult to get help if something goes wrong.",
    "Cost: Building a computer from scratch can be more expensive than buying a pre-built computer. This is because individual components can be more expensive than a complete system, and there may be additional costs associated with the tools and software needed to install and configure the components.",
    "Environmental impact: The production and disposal of computer components can have a negative environmental impact. For example, the manufacturing process for computer components can be energy-intensive, and the disposal of electronic waste can be hazardous to the environment.",
    "Compatibility with operating systems: When building a computer from scratch, it's important to ensure that the components are compatible with the operating system that will be installed. For example, if you plan to use a 64-bit operating system, you'll need to make sure that the CPU and RAM are compatible."
