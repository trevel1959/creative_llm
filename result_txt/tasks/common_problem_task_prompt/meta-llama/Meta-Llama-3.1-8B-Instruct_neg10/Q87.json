    "**Skill Overemphasis**: The training program might focus too much on a specific skill, neglecting other essential skills that are crucial for real-world applications. This could lead to \"skill silos\" where users become overly specialized in one area but lack a well-rounded understanding of the subject matter. To address this, the program could incorporate a diverse range of skills and activities to ensure a more comprehensive learning experience.",
    "**Inequitable Access**: The virtual reality program might not be accessible to users with certain disabilities or from underprivileged backgrounds due to the high cost of equipment or limited internet connectivity. To overcome this, the program could be designed with accessibility features, such as text-to-speech functionality, and made available through low-cost or free platforms.",
    "**Social Isolation**: The immersive nature of the virtual reality experience could lead to social isolation, as users spend more time interacting with the virtual environment than with real people. To combat this, the program could include social features that encourage users to interact with each other, such as multiplayer modes or group training sessions.",
    "**Content Obsolescence**: The training program's content might become outdated quickly, rendering it less effective or even counterproductive. To prevent this, the program could include a mechanism for users to contribute and update content, ensuring that the program stays relevant and accurate.",
    "**Data Security**: The program could collect sensitive user data, including performance metrics and personal information, which could be vulnerable to hacking or data breaches. To safeguard user data, the program could implement robust security measures, such as encryption and regular security audits."
