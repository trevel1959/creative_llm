    "**Color-Changing Candles**: Develop candles that change color as they burn. Using heat-sensitive dyes, the candle could transition through a spectrum of colors, creating a visual spectacle as it melts. This could be particularly appealing for events like parties or romantic dinners, as the shifting colors would add an enchanting atmosphere. The colors could also be tied to specific scents to enhance the sensory experience.",
    "**Candle with Embedded Seeds**: Design candles that have seed paper embedded within them. Once the candle has completely burned down, the leftover wax can be used as a biodegradable pot. Users can then plant the seed paper in soil, allowing them to grow flowers, herbs, or even vegetables. This eco-friendly approach not only promotes sustainability but also gives the candle a second life after it has served its purpose.",
    "**Interactive Candle Holders**: Create candle holders that are interactive and can respond to the candle's flame. These holders could include sensors that react to the flicker of the flame by changing colors, playing soft music, or even emitting a gentle mist of fragrance. The interactive experience would make the ambiance more immersive, perfect for gatherings or personal relaxation time.",
    "**Candle Subscription Box**: Launch a subscription service where customers receive a curated box of unique, artisanal candles each month. Each box could focus on a theme—such as seasonal scents, local artisans, or wellness—and include exclusive candles that aren’t available in stores. Additionally, subscribers could receive educational materials on candle-making, scent pairing, and how to create the perfect ambiance at home.",
    "**Eco-Friendly Refill Candles**: Introduce a line of candles that come with a reusable glass or ceramic container. When the candle is finished, customers can purchase a refill kit containing just the wax and wick. This approach minimizes waste and promotes sustainability while allowing users to keep their favorite candle holder. The refill kits could also come in different scents, enabling customization."
