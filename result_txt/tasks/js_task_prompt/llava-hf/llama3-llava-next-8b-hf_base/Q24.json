    "Green Spaces: 50% of the city would be dedicated to green spaces. This would include parks, forests, gardens, and green roofs. Green spaces would not only provide a habitat for wildlife, but also improve air quality, reduce the urban heat island effect, and offer recreational opportunities for residents.",
    "Public Transit: The city would have a comprehensive public transportation network that includes buses, trams, trains, subways, and pedestrian walkways. This network would be efficiently designed with the needs of residents in mind, including easy access to the city center, traffic and congestion reduction, and a focus on sustainability and energy efficient technologies.",
    "Renewable Energy: The city would be powered by at least 100% renewable energy sources, such as solar, wind, and hydroelectric. Sustainable energy production would be incorporated into building design and infrastructure, reducing reliance on fossil fuels and minimizing the environmental impact.",
    "Food Production: The city would have an integrated network of community gardens, greenhouses, and hydroponic farms that would provide fresh, organic, and abundant food for residents. Green architecture and smart farming techniques would be used in these spaces to maximize production and efficiency.",
    "Smart Infrastructure: The city's infrastructure would incorporate smart technology to improve the quality of life and sustainability. This includes things like intelligent traffic management systems, automated waste collection and management, and real-time monitoring and management of public services."
