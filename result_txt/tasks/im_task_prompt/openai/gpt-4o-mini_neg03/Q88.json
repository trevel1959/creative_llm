    "**Adjustable Length with Memory Foam Grip**: Design ski poles with an adjustable length mechanism that allows skiers to easily modify the height based on their preference or terrain. Additionally, the grips can be made from memory foam that conforms to the user's hand shape for improved comfort and reduced fatigue during long skiing sessions.",
    "**Built-in Avalanche Safety Features**: Equip ski poles with safety features such as an avalanche beacon that can transmit a signal in case of an emergency. The poles could also include a small, retractable shovel for quick digging in case of an avalanche situation, making them multifunctional tools for backcountry skiers.",
    "**Integrated Hydration System**: Create ski poles that feature a built-in hydration system. The poles could have a hollow core that allows for a water reservoir, with a small tube running to a mouthpiece on the grip. This would enable skiers to stay hydrated without needing to stop and reach for a water bottle.",
    "**LED Light Indicators for Visibility**: Incorporate LED lights at the top of the ski poles to enhance visibility during low-light conditions. These lights could be programmed to change colors based on the skier's speed or terrain, providing visual cues for safety and making it easier for others to see the skier on the slopes.",
    "**Ski Pole with a Modular Accessory System**: Design ski poles that allow for the attachment of various accessories, such as a camera mount for capturing action shots, a phone holder for navigation or music, or even a small first-aid kit. This modular system would cater to different skier needs and preferences, making the poles versatile for various activities."
