    "Use a rolled-up towel or blanket: Another idea is to roll up a towel or blanket and use it as a makeshift pillow. By placing it under your neck and along the curve of your head, you can create a more comfortable and supportive sleeping surface.",
    "Try an inflatable pillow: Inflatable pillows are a great alternative to traditional pillows. They can be easily stored and deflated, and they offer customizable firmness. Simply inflate one to your desired level of support, and place it beneath your head while you sleep.",
    "Use a chair or couch cushion: You can also elevate your head by using a firm chair or couch cushion. Wedge the cushion against a wall or stack more pillows or cushions on top of it to create a makeshift headboard. This will provide additional support and comfort during sleep.",
    "Try a body pillow: A long, cylindrical pillow, also known as a body pillow, can provide support for both your head and body. Position the pillow between your legs and use it to prop your head up against a wall or headboard. This can help you achieve a more comfortable sleeping position and alleviate pressure on your neck and spine.",
    "Invert a bowl: An unconventional option for a pillow replacement is an inverted bowl. Using a bowl that is tall enough to rest your head in, but not too deep, can provide support and comfort. You may want to add a soft item like a cloth or towel inside the bowl to add cushioning and make it more comfortable."
