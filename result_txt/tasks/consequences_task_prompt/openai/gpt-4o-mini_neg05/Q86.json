    "**Photosynthesis Halt**: Without sunlight, plants would be unable to perform photosynthesis, leading to a rapid die-off of vegetation. Within a month, most plants would wilt and die, disrupting the food chain and causing a severe food shortage. This would force humans to rely on stored food supplies, leading to rationing and potential conflict over resources.",
    "**Ecological Collapse**: The disappearance of the sun would trigger a chain reaction in ecosystems. Herbivores would starve without plants, leading to a collapse in predator populations as their food sources diminish. This could lead to a significant loss of biodiversity, as many species would struggle to adapt to the new, dark environment, resulting in extinctions.",
    "**Psychological Effects**: The sudden absence of sunlight would have profound psychological impacts on humans. Seasonal Affective Disorder (SAD) would likely affect a larger portion of the population, causing widespread depression and anxiety. The lack of natural light could disrupt circadian rhythms, leading to sleep disorders and increased stress levels, affecting mental health on a global scale.",
    "**Technological and Energy Crisis**: With the sun gone, reliance on solar energy would be rendered useless, creating a crisis for countries heavily dependent on solar power. Other energy sources would be pushed to their limits, leading to potential shortages and increased energy prices. This could spark innovation in energy technology as nations scramble to find alternative solutions to meet the demands of a cold, dark world.",
    "**Cultural and Social Changes**: The disappearance of the sun would prompt a reevaluation of human culture and social structures. Festivals, traditions, and daily routines centered around sunlight would need to be reimagined. Communities might come together to share resources and support one another in survival, fostering a sense of unity and resilience, or conversely, it could lead to panic and societal breakdown."
