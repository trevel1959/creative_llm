    "**Solar Oven**: I'd use a makeshift solar oven made from a cardboard box, aluminum foil, and plastic wrap. I'd place the food in the center, cover it with the plastic wrap, and weigh it down with rocks. The sun's heat would cook the food slowly, using the greenhouse effect to trap the heat.",
    "**Rock Pit Cooking**: I'd dig a pit in the ground and line it with rocks. I'd then place a metal grate or a flat rock over the pit and place the food on it. By creating a fire using dry leaves, twigs, and other flammable materials, I'd cook the food over the pit, using the rocks to retain heat and cook the food evenly.",
    "**Sandwich of the Gods**: I'd use a combination of edible plants, nuts, and seeds to create a sandwich. I'd forage for wild greens like dandelion or plantain, and pair them with nuts like walnuts or almonds. I'd also add some dried fruit and seeds like sunflower or pumpkin for added flavor and nutrition.",
    "**Fire Pit Skillet**: I'd create a makeshift skillet using a cast-iron pot or a metal plate. I'd place it over a fire pit, made from a ring of rocks, and cook the food using the skillet's heat retention. I'd add some oil or animal fat to the skillet to prevent sticking and add flavor to the food.",
    "**Cave Cooking**: I'd use the natural insulation of a cave to cook my meal. I'd place a metal container or a clay pot over a small fire, and let the cave's natural heat retention cook the food slowly. This method would be especially useful in cold climates, where the cave's insulation would help retain heat and cook the food evenly."
