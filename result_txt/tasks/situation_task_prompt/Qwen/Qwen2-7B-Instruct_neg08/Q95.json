    "**Inflatable Pillow Alternative**: In this idea, we can create an inflatable pillow that is attached to the bed frame or the wall near the head of the bed. This pillow can be inflated before bedtime and deflated when not in use. It serves as a comfortable resting place for the head, and its compact size makes it easy to store away. The material used should be soft and breathable to ensure comfort.",
    "**Egg-shaped Resting Place**: Inspired by the shape of eggs, we could create a series of small, rounded platforms that can be arranged to support the head while sleeping. These platforms can be made from memory foam for extra comfort and can be connected together in different configurations. They offer a unique and artistic solution to the problem of finding a substitute pillow.",
    "**Water-filled Pillowcase**: This concept involves creating a pillowcase filled with water. The pillowcase itself would be made from a durable, waterproof material that can withstand the pressure of water. By adjusting the amount of water inside, one can customize the firmness or softness of the pillow to their liking. Additionally, the coolness of the water can provide a refreshing sensation during hot summer nights.",
    "**Magnetic Headrest System**: This innovative idea utilizes magnets to attach a flexible fabric or foam pad to the back of the bed frame or a wall. The user can adjust the position and angle of the headrest according to their comfort needs. This system allows for personalized adjustments without the need for traditional pillows, making it suitable for various sleeping positions.",
    "**Gravity-Activated Pillow**: This concept involves a pillow that adjusts its shape based on gravity. The pillow contains sensors that detect the user's head position and adjust its shape accordingly. For example, if the user is lying on their side, the pillow will curve to provide better support for the neck and shoulders. This technology ensures a comfortable sleep posture and reduces the strain on the body, leading to better quality sleep."
