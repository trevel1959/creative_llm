    "**Zoo Volunteer Challenge**: Create an interactive challenge where visitors can become temporary zoo volunteers for a day. This could include tasks like feeding animals, cleaning enclosures, or assisting in animal enrichment activities. Participants would receive a special certificate upon completion, boosting their sense of achievement.",
    "**Animal Adoption Program**: Launch a program that allows visitors to \"adopt\" animals from your zoo.
