    "**UV-Protective Hairnet:** Design a hairnet that's specifically made to protect the scalp from UV rays. This hairnet would be made of a breathable fabric infused with UV-blocking properties, ensuring it doesn't restrict airflow while protecting against sunburn.",
    "**Scalp Cooling Caps:** Create cooling caps that fit snugly over the head. These caps could have embedded cooling elements that maintain a lower temperature on the scalp, thereby reducing heat absorption from sunlight. They might also incorporate a layer of UV-protective material to shield the scalp.",
    "**Wearable Sun Umbrellas:** Develop a wearable umbrella that fits around the head, similar to a large visor but more adaptable and adjustable. This could be made from lightweight, breathable materials and include features like detachable sides for shade extension or built-in UV filters.",
    "**Smart UV-Shield Helmets:** Produce helmets equipped with advanced sensors that detect UV radiation levels. The helmet would adjust its UV-blocking properties based on real-time data, offering maximum protection without overheating. It could also have a cooling system to keep the wearer comfortable.",
    "**Reflective Scalp Masks:** Create masks that cover the scalp, made from highly reflective materials that bounce sunlight away from the skin. These masks can be designed with adjustable straps for comfort and ventilation, and may include features like built-in fans or moisture-wicking fabrics for added comfort during outdoor activities."
