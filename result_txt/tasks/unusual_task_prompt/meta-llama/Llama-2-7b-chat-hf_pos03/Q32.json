    "Smart Hairbrush: Create a hairbrush with built-in sensors that detect the user's hair type, length, and damage. The brush could analyze the data and provide personalized recommendations for hair care, such as the best shampoo and conditioner for their specific needs. The brush could also detect and alert the user of any split ends or breakage, allowing them to take action before it becomes a bigger problem.",
    "Interactive Hairbrush: Develop a hairbrush with a built-in display that shows tutorials and styling tips as the user brushes their hair. The brush could be connected to a mobile app that provides a virtual stylist, offering personalized advice and guidance on how to achieve different hairstyles and looks.",
    "Customizable Hairbrush: Create a hairbrush with interchangeable heads, allowing the user to customize the brush to their specific hair type and needs. For example, a person with curly hair could use a brush with a curved head, while someone with straight hair could use a brush with a flat head. The heads could be made of different materials, such as rubber or plastic, to suit different hair textures.",
    "Hairbrush with Music: Develop a hairbrush that doubles as a portable music player. The brush could have a small speaker built into the handle, allowing the user to listen to music or podcasts while they brush their hair. The brush could also have a microphone built-in, allowing the user to take hands-free calls or control their smart home devices.",
    "VR Hairbrush: Create a hairbrush that immerses the user in a virtual reality world while they brush their hair. The brush could have a built-in VR headset, allowing the user to explore different virtual environments, such as a beach or a forest, while they brush their hair. The brush could also have sensors that detect the user's hair movements, allowing them to interact with the virtual environment in a more realistic way."
