    "**Spatula Saver**: Design a spork that has a built-in spout for pouring sauces, soups, or even drinks. The spout would be made of a flexible, silicone material that can be easily squeezed to control the flow of liquid. This innovative design would make mealtime more efficient and convenient, especially for those with limited dexterity or mobility. Imagine being able to enjoy a bowl of soup without having to worry about spills or awkwardly tilting the bowl.",
    "**Spatula Sculptor**: Create a spatula with interchangeable heads made from different materials, such as stainless steel, silicone, or even a heat-resistant glass. Each head would be designed for specific tasks, like scraping the sides of a bowl, flipping delicate foods, or serving hot dishes. This modular design would allow users to customize their spatula to suit their cooking needs and preferences. For example, a chef might use the stainless steel head for high-heat searing, while a home cook might prefer the silicone head for its non-stick properties.",
    "**Spatula Smart**: Develop a spatula with built-in sensors and a companion app that track cooking times, temperatures, and even nutritional information. The app would provide users with real-time feedback and suggestions for improving their cooking techniques. The spatula itself could include features like a built-in thermometer, a timer, or even a mini camera for monitoring cooking progress. This smart spatula would be an invaluable tool for both beginners and experienced cooks looking to refine their skills.",
    "**Spatula Steamer**: Design a spatula with a built-in steamer basket that allows users to cook delicate foods like fish, vegetables, or even eggs without direct heat. The steamer basket would be made of a heat-resistant material and could be easily removed for serving. This innovative design would make cooking a variety of dishes easier and more efficient, especially for those who struggle with traditional steaming methods.",
    "**Spatula Social**: Create a spatula with a built-in serving tray or plate that can be easily attached and detached. This design would make serving and portioning food a breeze, especially for large gatherings or events. The serving tray could be made of a durable, easy-to-clean material and could include features like a built-in utensil holder or a serving spoon rest. This social spatula would be perfect for entertaining and making mealtime more enjoyable for both hosts and guests.
