    "**Self-Cleaning Mechanism**: Design a washing machine with an integrated self-cleaning feature that uses UV light and steam to sanitize the drum and eliminate mold and bacteria buildup. This feature would activate after a certain number of washes or could be initiated by the user, ensuring that the machine remains hygienic without the need for harsh chemicals.",
    "**Eco-Friendly Detergent Dispenser**: Develop a washing machine that includes a built-in eco-friendly detergent dispenser that uses biodegradable capsules or pods. This dispenser would automatically release the right amount of detergent based on the load size and soil level, reducing waste and ensuring that users donâ€™t overuse detergent, which can be harmful to the environment.",
    "**Dual-Load Design**: Create a washing machine with a dual-load feature that allows users to wash two separate loads simultaneously, each with different settings. This could be particularly useful for families who want to wash delicates and heavy-duty items at the same time, saving time and energy while maintaining the integrity of different fabrics.",
    "**Interactive App Integration**: Develop a companion app that connects to the washing machine, allowing users to monitor and control their laundry from their smartphones. The app could provide notifications when a cycle is complete, suggest optimal wash settings based on the load, and even offer troubleshooting assistance or maintenance reminders.",
    "**Noise Reduction Technology**: Implement advanced noise-canceling technology in the washing machine, utilizing sound-dampening materials and innovative design to minimize operational noise. This would be especially beneficial for urban dwellers or those living in small spaces, allowing them to run their laundry at any time without disturbing others."
