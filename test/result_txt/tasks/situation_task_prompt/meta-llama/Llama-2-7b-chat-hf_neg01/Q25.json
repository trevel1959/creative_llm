    "Use a Stair-Crawler: Design a robotic staircase that can be summoned to the skyscraper. The stair-crawler would be powered by electricity and have multiple legs to climb up the stairs. It could be controlled remotely or programmed to climb automatically.",
    "Bungee Elevator: Develop a bungee cord-based elevator system that can stretch and absorb the impact of the fall. The elevator car would be attached to a bungee cord that would stretch and absorb the impact of the fall, allowing it to reach the top of the skyscraper safely.",
    "Gravity-Defying Elevator: Create an elevator that uses magnets to defy gravity. The elevator car would be suspended by magnetic fields, allowing it to climb the skyscraper without the need for cables or pulleys. This would eliminate the risk of cable failure and ensure a smooth ride to the top.",
    "Pneumatic Tube System: Develop a pneumatic tube system that uses compressed air to propel the elevator car to the top of the skyscraper. The tube would be made of a lightweight and durable material, such as carbon fiber, and would be powered by an air compressor located at the bottom of the skyscraper.",
    "Flying Elevator: Create an elevator that uses aerodynamic principles to fly to the top of the skyscraper. The elevator car would be designed to generate lift using wing-like structures, similar to an airplane. The car would be propelled by fans or jet engines, allowing it to reach the top of the skyscraper quickly and safely."
