The organization will need people to help with various tasks, such as teaching reading, organizing events, and managing administrative tasks. Finding enough volunteers can be challenging, especially if the organization is new and has no established network of supporters.",
    "Space: The organization will need a physical space to operate, such as a classroom or office. Finding an affordable location that is easily accessible to children and their families can be difficult, especially in urban areas with high demand for space.",
    "Curriculum development: The organization will need to develop a curriculum for teaching reading skills. This can be a complex task, as the curriculum must be age-appropriate, engaging, and effective. The organization may need to hire educators or literacy experts to help with this process.",
    "Marketing: The organization will need to market its services and attract students. This can be a challenge, especially if the organization is new and has no established reputation. The organization may need to develop a marketing plan, create promotional materials, and establish relationships with local schools and community organizations.",
    "Staffing: The organization will need to hire staff to manage day-to-day operations. This can be difficult, especially if the organization is small and has limited resources.
