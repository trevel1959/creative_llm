    "**Multi-Function Bell with LED Light**: Design a bicycle bell that incorporates a bright LED light. The bell can serve as a warning signal during the day and a safety light at night. Riders can activate the light with a simple press of the bell, making it useful for both alerting pedestrians and increasing visibility during low-light conditions. The light could also have different modes (steady, flashing, or SOS) for added functionality.",
    "**Personalized Sound Selection**: Introduce a bicycle bell that allows users to choose or record their own sounds. Using a small onboard speaker and microphone, riders can select from a library of sounds or create a custom chime that reflects their personality. This feature would add a fun and personal touch to the biking experience while still serving the primary function of alerting others.",
    "**Eco-Friendly Solar-Powered Bell**: Develop a bicycle bell that harnesses solar energy to power its features. This eco-friendly bell could have an integrated solar panel that charges a small battery, allowing for additional functionalities like a built-in horn or light without draining the riderâ€™s energy. The bell could also have a manual crank for charging in case of low sunlight conditions.",
    "**Vibration Alert System**: Create a bicycle bell that features a vibration alert system for cyclists who are hard of hearing or prefer a discreet notification. This bell would vibrate in the handlebars or seat post when activated, allowing the rider to alert nearby pedestrians or cyclists without relying solely on sound. This could be especially useful in quiet environments or during early morning rides.",
    "**Smart Safety Bell with Proximity Sensors**: Design a bicycle bell equipped with proximity sensors that automatically activate when a cyclist approaches pedestrians or other cyclists. The bell would emit a sound or light signal to alert others of the cyclist's presence, ensuring safety without requiring the rider to press the bell. This feature could enhance safety in crowded areas or on shared paths."
