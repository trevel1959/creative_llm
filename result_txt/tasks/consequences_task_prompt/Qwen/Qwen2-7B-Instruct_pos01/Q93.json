    "**Universal Happiness Society**: If a cure for all mental illnesses were discovered, society could experience an unprecedented level of happiness and productivity. This might lead to a significant shift in societal norms, where mental health is seen as equally important as physical health. The concept of \"happiness\" might evolve to mean not just the absence of mental illness but also a profound sense of well-being, leading to a more compassionate and empathetic society.",
    "**Education Revolution**: Mental health awareness and education would become mainstream, leading to significant changes in the education system. Curricula might include emotional intelligence training, stress management techniques, and mindfulness practices from an early age. This could potentially lead to better academic performance and a more emotionally resilient population.",
    "**Workplace Transformations**: Companies might need to adapt drastically to accommodate this new reality. Flexible work schedules, mental health days, and enhanced support systems (like counseling services) could become standard. Job roles might evolve to prioritize mental health, such as the creation of \"wellness officers\" or \"emotional support specialists.\"",
    "**Cultural Shifts**: With mental health no longer stigmatized, discussions around personal struggles and mental health might become more common. Art, literature, and media could reflect these changes, offering nuanced portrayals of mental health issues and promoting understanding and empathy. This could lead to a richer cultural landscape that embraces diversity and complexity.",
    "**Economic Impact**: A healthier, more productive workforce could boost economic growth. Mental health treatments might also become less costly due to advancements in technology and research, reducing healthcare costs. However, there could be an initial economic burden associated with the transition period, including the cost of researching and implementing the cure, as well as the infrastructure needed to support widespread mental health initiatives."
