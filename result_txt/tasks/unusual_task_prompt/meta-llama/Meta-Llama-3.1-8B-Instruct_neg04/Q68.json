The UV light would be triggered by a sensor that detects when the user's hands are placed under the dispenser, ensuring that the soap and the dispenser itself are sanitized after each use. This feature would be especially useful in high-traffic areas such as public restrooms or hospitals, where the spread of germs and illnesses is a significant concern.",
