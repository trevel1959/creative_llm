    "Build a bridge: One solution to cross a large body of water without ships or boats is to build a bridge. This bridge can be made of various materials such as steel, concrete, or wood, depending on the location and resources available. The bridge can be built across the river, lake, or ocean, and can be used to travel from one side to the other.",
    "Build a submersible: Another solution is to build a submersible that can withstand the pressure of the water and can be used to travel underwater. The submersible can be equipped with the necessary equipment such as oxygen tanks, communication systems, and navigation equipment.",
    "Use a floating device: A floating device such as a raft or a paddleboat can be used to cross a large body of water. The device can be made of lightweight materials such as wood or plastic, and can be easily navigated using paddles or sails.",
    "Build a dam: If the water body is wide and deep, building a dam can be a solution. The dam can be built at the narrowest point of the water body, and can be used to create a lake or a reservoir. The lake can be used to build a bridge or a submersible, or a floating device can be used to cross the lake.",
    "Use a waterplane: A waterplane is a type of aircraft that can take off and land on water. It can be used to cross a large body of water by flying over it. The waterplane can be equipped with the necessary equipment such as navigation systems and communication equipment, and can be used to travel to different destinations."
