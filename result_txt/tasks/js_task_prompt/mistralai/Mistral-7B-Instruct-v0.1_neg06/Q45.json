It would be particularly useful for people with visual impairments or for those who need to navigate in noisy environments.",
    "Infrared Vision: A sense that allows us to see in infrared light. This sense would allow us to see objects that are invisible to the naked eye, such as electronic devices and heat sources. It would be particularly useful for scientists and engineers who need to study the behavior of objects in different wavelengths of light.",
    "Time Sense: A sense that allows us to perceive the passage of time. This sense would allow us to experience the flow of time in a more intuitive way, making it easier to manage our time and prioritize tasks.
