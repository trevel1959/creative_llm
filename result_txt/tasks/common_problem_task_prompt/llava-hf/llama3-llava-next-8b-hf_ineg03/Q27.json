    "Limited Funding: Developing a vaccine for a new disease can be costly. Limited funding can hinder the research and development process, making it difficult to invest in the necessary resources and personnel.",
    "Ethical Considerations: Developing a vaccine for a new disease raises ethical concerns, such as the potential risks and side effects associated with the vaccine, as well as the distribution of the vaccine to different populations.",
    "Safety Concerns: Ensuring the safety of the vaccine is a critical concern. Any safety issues can lead to a loss of public trust and could potentially exacerbate the spread of the disease.",
    "Clinical Trials: Conducting clinical trials is a crucial step in the development of a vaccine. Ensuring that these trials are conducted in a timely manner and with sufficient participants is important for the success of the vaccine.",
    "Distribution and Logistics: Once a vaccine is developed, the distribution and logistics of getting it to the population are crucial. This includes the infrastructure to store, transport, and administer the vaccine, as well as the ability to reach remote and underserved areas."
