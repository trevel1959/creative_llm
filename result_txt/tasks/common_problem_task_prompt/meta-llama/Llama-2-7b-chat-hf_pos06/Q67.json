    "Vertical Farming: Create a multi-level farm in a large, indoor space such as a warehouse or greenhouse. This allows for maximum growing space in a small area, reducing the environmental impact of land use and increasing crop yields. Use hydroponics or aeroponics to grow crops without soil, and utilize LED lighting for optimal growth and energy efficiency. Confidence score: 0.8",
    "Biodynamic Farming: Embrace the principles of biodynamics, which emphasize the interconnectedness of all living things and the farm as a living organism. Use compost and manure from the farm to create a self-sustaining ecosystem, and practice crop rotation and polyculture to promote soil health and biodiversity. Confidence score: 0.9",
    "Aquaponics: Combine aquaculture (raising fish) with hydroponics to create a closed-loop system where the waste from the fish is used as fertilizer for the plants. This system requires minimal water and land, making it ideal for areas with limited resources. Use a variety of fish species and crops to create a diverse and resilient ecosystem. Confidence score: 0.8",
    "Community Supported Agriculture (CSA): Create a subscription-based model where members of the community pay a fee to receive a share of the farm's produce on a regular basis. This model provides a stable income stream for the farm and fosters a connection between the farmer and the consumer. Offer additional services such as workshops, farm tours, and educational resources to enhance the member's experience. Confidence score: 0.9",
    "Regenerative Agriculture: Prioritize soil health and biodiversity in the farm's operations. Use practices such as no-till or reduced-till farming, cover cropping, and crop rotation to improve soil structure and fertility. This approach not only enhances the health of the soil but also promotes ecological balance and resilience. Confidence score: 0.9"
