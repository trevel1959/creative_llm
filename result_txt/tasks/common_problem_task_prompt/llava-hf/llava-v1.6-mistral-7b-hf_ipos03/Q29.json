    "**Communication**: Effective communication is essential for a successful mission. The crew needs to be able to communicate with each other and with the surface team to coordinate their activities, share information, and respond to any emergencies. Poor communication can lead to confusion, delays, and potentially dangerous situations.",
    "**Pressure and Depth**: Deep-sea exploration missions take place at great depths and under immense pressure. The crew and equipment must be able to withstand these extreme conditions. If there's a failure in the pressure containment system, it could lead to a rapid decompression, which is life-threatening.",
    "**Lighting**: Adequate lighting is necessary for the crew to navigate the underwater environment and perform tasks. In the event of a lighting failure, the crew may be unable to see, increasing the risk of accidents or getting lost.",
    "**Navigation**: Deep-sea exploration missions often take place in areas with limited or no GPS signals. The crew must rely on their own navigation skills and equipment to determine their location and avoid getting lost or disoriented.",
    "**Environmental Hazards**: Deep-sea environments can be hazardous, with potential threats such as underwater volcanoes, tectonic activity, or dangerous marine life. The crew must be prepared to respond to these hazards and avoid any harm."
