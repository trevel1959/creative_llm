    "**Zero-Gravity Sports**: Sports would take on a whole new dimension, with athletes competing in zero-gravity environments. Sports like basketball, football, and tennis would be played with a twist, as the lack of gravity would fundamentally change the dynamics of the game.",
    "**Urban Planning and Architecture**: Buildings would be designed to accommodate the lack of gravity. Floating cities could be built in space, and gravity could be used to control the movement of objects within a building.",
    "**Teleportation and FTL Travel**: Without the need for gravity, faster-than-light (FTL) travel would become a reality. This would revolutionize interstellar travel, leading to a more interconnected universe.",
    "**Economic and Political Implications**: The absence of gravity would likely lead to a shift in economic and political power. Countries with advanced gravity control technology would have a significant advantage, leading to a new world order.",
    "**Scientific Research**: The study of gravity would be entirely redefined, and new fields of physics would emerge. Scientists would explore the fundamental nature of gravity and its role in the universe."
