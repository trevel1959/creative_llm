    "**Customizable Brew Strength**: Introduce a dial or touchscreen interface that allows users to customize the brew strength and flavor profile. By adjusting the water temperature, brew time, and coffee-to-water ratio, users can create their perfect cup. The coffee maker could even have pre-set profiles for different types of coffee (e.g., espresso, cold brew, French press) that users can select.",
    "**Built-in Grinder with Freshness Indicator**: Add a high-quality grinder to the coffee maker, along with a freshness indicator that alerts users when their coffee beans are losing flavor. The grinder could have adjustable settings for different grind sizes, and the freshness indicator could be based on the time since the beans were ground, ensuring every cup is made with the freshest coffee possible.",
    "**Self-Cleaning System**: Implement a self-cleaning feature that uses steam and hot water to clean the internal components of the coffee maker. Users could simply press a button, and the machine would run a cleaning cycle, removing any residue and buildup. This would not only save time but also enhance the longevity of the coffee maker.",
    "**Sustainable Brew Options**: Design the coffee maker to work with reusable coffee pods or filters, promoting sustainability. Users could purchase a set of stainless steel or biodegradable filters that reduce waste. Additionally, the machine could have a feature that tracks and displays the environmental impact of their coffee consumption, encouraging eco-friendly habits.",
    "**Integrated Milk Frother and Flavor Infuser**: Include a built-in milk frother that allows users to create lattes and cappuccinos directly from the coffee maker. Additionally, a flavor infuser could be added, allowing users to add syrups or spices (like cinnamon or vanilla) during the brewing process for customized flavors. This would elevate the coffee experience without needing extra appliances."
