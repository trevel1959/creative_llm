    "**The Transformation Tale**: Create an interactive storybook where the reader becomes the frog that wishes to become a prince. The story involves magical potions, hidden treasures, and various challenges that the frog must overcome to transform into a prince. Each page could feature a choice for the reader to make, such as \"Do you help the frog rescue the princess or do you keep her safe from danger?\" This would engage the reader's imagination and encourage critical thinking.",
    "**Role-Playing Game**: Develop a role-playing game set in a kingdom where players take on the role of a frog who dreams of becoming a prince. They must navigate through different levels, each with its own set of challenges (e.g., diplomacy, magic, combat) to prove their worthiness. As they progress, they can unlock new abilities, such as transforming into a prince, and encounter characters from the original tale who offer advice or quests.",
    "**Visual Art Project**: Encourage creativity by having students create a visual art project based on the theme of transformation. Students can draw, paint, or sculpt a series of images showing the frog at various stages of its journey, from the initial wish to the final transformation. Each image can be accompanied by a short paragraph explaining the scene, highlighting the emotions or thoughts of the frog during that stage.",
    "**Musical Composition**: Compose a musical piece inspired by the story, focusing on the emotional journey of the frog. The composition could start with a slow, melancholic melody representing the frog's initial state, gradually building up to a more upbeat, triumphant tune when the frog transforms into a prince. Include elements of orchestration, such as strings for sadness, brass for power, and woodwinds for whimsy.",
    "**Dance Performance**: Create a dance performance that visually interprets the story. The choreography could depict the frog's transformation through different dance stylesâ€”perhaps starting with a slow, fluid movement to represent the initial wish, transitioning to more complex, energetic steps as the frog gains confidence, and culminating in a grand finale that symbolizes the final transformation into a prince. This could be performed live or recorded for viewing, incorporating costumes and sets that enhance the narrative."
