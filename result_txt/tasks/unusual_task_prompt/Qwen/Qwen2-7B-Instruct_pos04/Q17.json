    "**Personalized Coffee Mug with Hidden Quotes:** Create a coffee mug that appears plain on the outside but has a hidden message or quote that only reveals itself when the mug is filled with hot liquid. The idea is to use heat-sensitive ceramic paint to print the quote. This can be a great gift for someone who appreciates subtle humor or inspiration that's revealed at the perfect moment.",
    "**Smart Coffee Mug with Temperature Control:** Design a smart coffee mug that can maintain your drink at the perfect temperature for optimal drinking experience. It can be paired with an app on your smartphone, allowing you to set the temperature before leaving home or adjusting it remotely. This is particularly useful for people who prefer their coffee at a specific temperature.",
    "**Eco-Friendly Coffee Mug with Rechargeable Battery:** Make a coffee mug that incorporates solar power technology to keep drinks warm. The mug would have a small solar panel on top that can charge a rechargeable battery inside the mug. This way, the mug can keep drinks warm without needing any external electrical source, promoting eco-friendliness and convenience.",
    "**Customizable Coffee Mug with 3D Printing:** Use 3D printing technology to create custom-shaped coffee mugs. The designs could be inspired by popular movies, books, or personal hobbies. For example, a Harry Potter fan might get a mug shaped like the Hogwarts crest, or a gamer might receive a mug in the shape of their favorite video game character. ",
    "**Interactive Coffee Mug with QR Code:** Print a QR code on the bottom of each coffee mug that leads to a website where customers can find recipes, tips, or even stories about the brand or the coffee. This adds an interactive element to the traditional coffee-drinking experience, potentially enhancing customer engagement and loyalty."
