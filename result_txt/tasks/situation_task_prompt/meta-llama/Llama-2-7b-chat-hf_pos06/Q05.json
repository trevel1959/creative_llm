    "Build-up Solar-Powered Lights: One way to ensure sufficient lighting during the day without the sun is to create a network of solar-powered streetlights that can provide light in the absence of sunlight. These lights can be strategically placed in areas where sunlight is scarce, such as in urban areas with tall buildings or in areas with frequent cloud cover. By harnessing the power of the sun during the day through solar panels, these lights can provide light during the night, ensuring that there is enough illumination for daily activities. Confidence Score: 0.8",
    "Mirror-based Lighting System: Another creative solution is to develop a mirror-based lighting system that can reflect sunlight during the day and provide light during the night. This system involves placing mirrors in strategic locations, such as on rooftops or in reflective surfaces, to reflect sunlight towards areas where it is needed. By using mirrors to redirect sunlight, this system can provide additional light during the night, making it possible to carry out daily activities without the sun's presence. Confidence Score: 0.9",
    "Artificial Sunlight Simulation: A more futuristic approach to providing light without the sun is to develop a technology that can simulate sunlight using artificial means. This could involve creating a large, artificial light source that mimics the sun's rays, providing a similar light spectrum and intensity to the sun. While this technology is still in its infancy, it could potentially provide a reliable source of light during the night, especially in areas where sunlight is scarce. Confidence Score: 0.7",
    "Bioluminescent Plant-based Lighting: Another creative solution is to use bioluminescent plants to provide light during the night. By genetically engineering plants to produce light, it is possible to create a sustainable and renewable source of light that does not rely on the sun. This approach could be particularly useful in areas where sunlight is scarce, such as in forests or other areas with dense vegetation. Confidence Score: 0.8",
    "Cloud-seeding Technology: Another solution to provide light during the night without the sun is to use cloud-seeding technology. By injecting substances into clouds, such as silver iodide or dry ice,"
