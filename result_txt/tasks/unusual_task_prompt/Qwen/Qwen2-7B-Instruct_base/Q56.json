    "**360Â° Virtual Reality Camera Experience**: Design a camera that captures 360-degree panoramic footage. This could be particularly useful for virtual tours, real estate viewing, or even for creating immersive experiences in video games. The camera would likely use multiple lenses to capture all angles at once, then stitch together the footage into a seamless experience.",
    "**Portable Drone Camera with Augmented Reality Overlay**: Create a compact drone equipped with a high-quality camera that can overlay augmented reality (AR) elements directly onto the live feed. This could allow users to see digital information superimposed over the physical world, such as GPS coordinates, speed, altitude, or even historical facts about landmarks. It's perfect for outdoor adventures, photography, or educational purposes.",
    "**Smartphone Attachment for Microscopic Photography**: Develop a smartphone camera attachment that allows for macro photography on a microscopic scale. This would consist of a small, high-resolution lens that attaches to the camera of any smartphone, enabling users to capture images of very small objects or details that are otherwise invisible to the naked eye. It's ideal for scientists, hobbyists, or anyone interested in close-up photography.",
    "**Time-Lapse Camera System with Weatherproof Design**: Design a camera system that automatically adjusts its settings based on the environment, making it suitable for long-term time-lapse photography. This camera should be weatherproof, capable of capturing stunning landscapes and cityscapes over days, weeks, or months. It would analyze lighting conditions, weather forecasts, and other factors to optimize exposure times and ensure the best possible results without human intervention.",
    "**Gesture-Controlled Camera**: Invent a camera that can be controlled through hand gestures. This could involve using advanced motion sensors to detect hand movements and translate them into commands for adjusting focus, zoom, or even taking photos. This type of camera would be particularly useful for hands-free applications, such as filming while skiing, diving, or participating in other activities where traditional controls might be impractical or dangerous."
