    "**Eco-Friendly Vacuum**: Implement an eco-friendly mode that reduces energy consumption when the vacuum is cleaning carpets, and a more powerful mode for hard floors. This would make the vacuum more environmentally friendly while still providing effective cleaning.",
    "**Multipurpose Vacuum**: Design the vacuum to have interchangeable attachments for different cleaning tasks, such as a crevice tool for tight spaces, a brush tool for upholstery, and a dust bag for larger debris. This would make the vacuum more versatile and suitable for a wider range of cleaning needs.",
    "**Hands-Free Vacuum**: Create a hands-free vacuum with a wearable headset that allows users to control the vacuum with voice commands. This would free up the user's hands for other tasks while still providing effective cleaning.",
    "**Vacuum with Self-Charging Technology**: Develop a vacuum with self-charging technology that automatically recharges the battery when it's low. This would eliminate the need to remember to charge the vacuum before each use.",
    "**Vacuum with Air Filtration**: Integrate an air filtration system into the vacuum that not only cleans the floor but also purifies the air in the room. This would make the vacuum a more comprehensive cleaning solution."
