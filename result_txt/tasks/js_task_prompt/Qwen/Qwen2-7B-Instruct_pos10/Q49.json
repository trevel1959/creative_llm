    "**A Universal Peace Flag**: With the power of this magical pen, I'd first create a flag that symbolizes peace, love, and unity. The flag could be adorned with symbols from all over the world - such as the olive branch for peace, the heart for love, and the interconnectedness of different cultures through a mosaic pattern. This flag would serve as a universal symbol promoting global harmony and understanding.",
    "**A Time Travel Device**: Next, I'd use my magic pen to draw a time machine. The design would be futuristic and sleek, with intricate gears and circuits. This device would allow anyone to travel through time, not just for personal adventures but also for educational purposes, enabling people to witness historical events firsthand or explore the future. It would be a powerful tool for learning and innovation.",
    "**A Personalized Health Coach**: I would draw an AI-powered health coach that adapts to the individual needs of each person. This assistant would monitor daily activities, nutrition, and health data, providing personalized advice on exercise routines, meal plans, and lifestyle adjustments. It would help users maintain optimal health and well-being, encouraging healthy habits and proactive self-care.",
    "**An Infinite Library**: Using the magic pen, I would create a digital library that contains every book ever written, as well as countless books yet to be written. This library would be accessible anywhere, anytime, providing unlimited access to knowledge and literature. It would revolutionize education and personal development by making information universally available and easily accessible.",
    "**A Zero-Waste City**: Lastly, I would draw a city designed for zero waste, with buildings that are eco-friendly, energy-efficient, and capable of recycling waste into resources. The city would incorporate green spaces, vertical gardens, and smart waste management systems, demonstrating sustainable living practices. This vision would inspire other cities to adopt similar models, contributing to a more environmentally conscious world."
