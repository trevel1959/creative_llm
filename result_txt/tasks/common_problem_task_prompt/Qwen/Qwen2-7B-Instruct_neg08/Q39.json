    "**Skill-Based Income Distribution**: Instead of providing a flat rate universal basic income to all citizens, this idea would allocate income based on individual skills and abilities. People could choose to specialize in fields they are passionate about or skilled in, ensuring that everyone's income is reflective of their contributions and value to society. This could reduce jealousy by acknowledging and rewarding individual efforts and talents.",
    "**Progressive Universal Basic Income**: A progressive UBI system adjusts income based on an individual's current income level. The more one earns, the less they receive in UBI, which might encourage higher earners to invest in societal causes or philanthropy. This could reduce feelings of envy by making the rich feel they are contributing more back into society than just receiving benefits.",
    "**Time-Based Universal Basic Income**: In this model, individuals are given a certain amount of time each week (like 40 hours) instead of money. This allows people to use their \"time income\" to either work for pay, volunteer, learn new skills, or pursue personal interests. It promotes self-sufficiency and encourages people to find meaning in their own pursuits, potentially reducing jealousy.",
    "**Universal Basic Investment**: Instead of providing cash, the government offers each citizen a stake in a diversified portfolio of investments. The returns from these investments would be distributed as income. This would ensure that every individual benefits from economic growth, regardless of their current financial status. It can also encourage investment literacy and financial independence.",
    "**Needs-Based Universal Basic Income**: This idea tailors the UBI amount based on the specific needs of each individual, such as housing costs, healthcare expenses, and education requirements. This ensures that the income provided is directly relevant to each person's circumstances, potentially reducing feelings of envy by addressing the root causes of financial stress. "
