    "**Lighting Limitations**: The tiny house's small size can make it difficult to achieve sufficient natural light, which can impact the overall ambiance and functionality of the space. To overcome this challenge, the design could incorporate large windows, skylights, or solar tubes to bring in natural light. Alternatively, the use of energy-efficient LED lighting can help to compensate for the lack of natural light.",
    "**Water Conservation Conundrum**: Tiny houses often have limited water supply, which can make it challenging to maintain hygiene and cleanliness. To address this issue, the design could incorporate water-conserving fixtures, such as low-flow showerheads and toilets, and a rainwater harvesting system to collect and store rainwater for non-potable uses.",
    "**Mobility Malfunction**: Tiny houses are often designed to be mobile, but the weight and size of the house can make it difficult to move. To overcome this challenge, the design could incorporate a lightweight yet durable frame, and a trailer system that allows for easy towing and maneuverability.",
    "**Insulation Insufficiency**: Tiny houses can be prone to temperature fluctuations, which can make them uncomfortable to live in. To address this issue, the design could incorporate high-performance insulation materials, such as spray foam or fiberglass, to maintain a consistent temperature and reduce energy consumption.",
    "**Waste Management Woes**: Tiny houses often have limited space for waste management, which can lead to unpleasant odors and health hazards. To overcome this challenge, the design could incorporate a composting toilet, a small trash compactor, and a recycling system to minimize waste and promote sustainability."
