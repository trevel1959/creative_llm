    "If I could no longer stand up, I would use a mobility scooter to move around. I would need to get one with a comfortable seat and a sturdy frame that can support my weight. I would also need to make sure it has a reliable braking system and a good range on the battery.",
    "I would explore alternative forms of transportation such as a wheelchair or a powerchair. I would research the different types of chairs available and choose one that fits my needs and preferences. I would also need to learn how to use the chair properly and safely.",
    "I would consider hiring a caregiver or a home health aide to assist me with my mobility needs. They could help me with tasks such as getting out of bed, using the bathroom, and getting dressed. They could also help me with transportation by pushing me in a wheelchair or using a mobility scooter.",
    "I would look into using assistive technology to help me move around. For example, I could use a robotic exoskeleton that attaches to my body and helps me walk. I could also use a voice-controlled wheelchair that responds to my commands.",
    "I would explore the possibility of living in a home with ramps and lifts to make it easier for me to move around. I could also install grab bars and handrails to help me with balance and stability. Additionally, I could use a walker or crutches to help me get around."
