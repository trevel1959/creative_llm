    "**Oceanic Ark**: A self-sustaining underwater habitat that can support a team of scientists and engineers for extended periods. The habitat would be designed to mimic the conditions found on Earth's surface, with its own air supply, food production, and waste management systems. The mission would involve deploying the habitat at the bottom of the ocean, where it would serve as a base for research and exploration.",
    "**Deep-Sea Mining**: A mission to explore and extract valuable resources from the ocean floor, such as rare earth minerals, copper, and gold. The team would use advanced submersibles and remotely operated vehicles (ROVs) to survey the seafloor, identify potential mining sites, and extract the resources.",
    "**Oceanic Energy Harvesting**: A mission to harness the energy potential of the ocean, including tidal, wave, and thermal energy. The team would design and deploy advanced systems to capture and convert the energy into electricity, which would be transmitted back to the surface or used to power the underwater habitat.",
    "**Marine Archaeology**: A mission to explore and document the underwater cultural heritage of the ocean, including shipwrecks, ancient cities, and other historical sites. The team would use advanced submersibles, ROVs, and other technologies to survey the seafloor, locate and excavate sites, and document the findings.",
