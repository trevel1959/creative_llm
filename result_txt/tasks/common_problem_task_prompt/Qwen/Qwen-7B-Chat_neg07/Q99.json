    "\"Eyesight Enhancer\": A device that uses advanced AI algorithms to analyze the user's environment and provide real-time visual feedback. It could be worn like glasses or a headset and use cameras and sensors to detect objects, colors, and shapes in the user's surroundings. The device would then convert this information into sound or vibrations, allowing the user to navigate their environment more easily.",
    "\"3D Audio Guide\": A portable audio system that uses 3D sound technology to create a virtual guide for people who are blind or have low vision. The device would use microphones to pick up sounds from the user's environment and then use sophisticated algorithms to create a 3D audio map of the area. The user could then wear headphones and follow the audio cues to navigate around their surroundings.",
    "\"Text-to-Speech Vision Aid\": A device that converts written text into speech, allowing people with visual impairments to access written materials more easily. The device could be connected to a computer or mobile device and would use advanced natural language processing algorithms to accurately read out loud any text that is displayed on the screen.",
    "\"Color-Enhancing Contact Lenses\": Contact lenses that use advanced lighting technology to enhance the colors of objects in the user's environment. The lenses would use tiny LEDs to create different color filters that can be adjusted according to the user's preferences. This would allow people with visual impairments to better see the colors around them and make their environment more accessible.",
    "\"Smart Home Automation System\": A home automation system that uses artificial intelligence to control lights, appliances, and other devices in the user's home. The system would use sensors and cameras to detect the user's movements and adjust the environment accordingly. For example, it could turn off the lights when the user leaves a room or adjust the temperature based on the user's preferences. This would make the home more accessible for people with visual impairments and allow them to live more independently."
