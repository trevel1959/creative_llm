    "**Eco-Friendly Biofuel Option**: Develop a lawn mower that runs on a specially formulated biofuel derived from plant waste or recycled oils. This eco-friendly fuel would reduce carbon emissions and promote sustainability. Additionally, the mower could have a built-in system to convert grass clippings into a biofuel supplement, allowing users to create their own fuel from the waste generated during mowing.",
    "**Modular Design for Versatility**: Create a modular lawn mower that allows users to easily swap out different attachments for various gardening tasks. For example, users could switch from a mowing deck to a mulching attachment, a leaf blower, or even a snow plow in winter. This design would save space and money by allowing one machine to perform multiple functions throughout the year.",
    "**Noise-Canceling Technology**: Implement noise-canceling technology into lawn mowers to reduce operational noise significantly. By using sound-dampening materials and active noise control systems, the mower could operate quietly, making it more neighborhood-friendly and allowing users to mow at any time without disturbing others. This feature would be especially beneficial in densely populated areas.",
    "**Self-Cleaning Mechanism**: Design a lawn mower with a self-cleaning feature that uses high-pressure water jets to remove grass clippings and debris from the blades and undercarriage after each use. This system would reduce the need for manual cleaning, save time, and help maintain the mower's performance and longevity. The self-cleaning cycle could be activated at the end of each mowing session or scheduled via the smart app.",
    "**Integrated Solar Charging**: Equip lawn mowers with solar panels that allow them to recharge while sitting in the sun. This solar charging capability could extend the battery life of electric mowers and reduce reliance on traditional power sources. The mower could also include a hybrid option, allowing users to switch between solar power and electric charging based on their needs and available sunlight."
