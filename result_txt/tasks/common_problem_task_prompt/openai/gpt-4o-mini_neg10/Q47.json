    "**Static Electricity Damage**: When handling sensitive electronic components, static electricity can pose a significant risk. A sudden discharge can damage delicate parts like the CPU or RAM. To mitigate this, builders must remember to use anti-static wrist straps, work on non-static surfaces, and frequently ground themselves, which can be overlooked in the excitement of assembling the parts.",
    "**Cooling Issues**: Proper cooling is crucial for maintaining optimal performance and longevity of the components. If the cooling system (fans, liquid cooling, etc.) is not adequately set up or if airflow is obstructed, it can lead to overheating. Builders must consider case design, fan placement, and thermal paste application, which can be daunting for beginners.",
    "**Cable Management Chaos**: Assembling a computer often leads to a tangled mess of cables, which can obstruct airflow and make troubleshooting difficult. Poor cable management can also make it challenging to replace or upgrade components in the future. Builders should plan their cable routing and consider using zip ties or cable sleeves to keep things organized.",
    "**BIOS/UEFI Configuration**: After assembling the hardware, the next challenge is configuring the BIOS/UEFI settings. This includes setting boot priorities, enabling XMP profiles for RAM, and adjusting fan curves. New builders may find this intimidating, as incorrect settings can lead to boot failures or performance issues.",
    "**Software Installation Confusion**: Once the hardware is assembled, the next step is installing the operating system and drivers. This process can be confusing, especially for those unfamiliar with partitioning disks, choosing the right installation options, or downloading necessary drivers. Mistakes during this phase can lead to system instability or a non-functional computer."
