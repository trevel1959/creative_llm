    "**Modular Wallet Design**: Create a wallet with detachable sections that can be customized based on the userâ€™s needs. For instance, users could add or remove compartments for cards, cash, coins, or even a small power bank for charging devices on the go. This modular approach allows for a personalized experience, catering to different lifestyles and preferences.",
    "**Eco-Friendly Materials**: Develop wallets made from sustainable materials, such as recycled plastics, organic cotton, or vegan leather. This not only appeals to environmentally conscious consumers but also promotes a brand ethos centered around sustainability. Additionally, offering a recycling program for old wallets could enhance this initiative.",
    "**Built-in Payment System**: Incorporate NFC (Near Field Communication) technology that allows users to make contactless payments directly from their wallet. This would eliminate the need for cards and cash, streamlining transactions. Users could link their bank accounts or payment apps to the wallet for added convenience and security.",
    "**Personalized Security Features**: Design a wallet with biometric security, such as fingerprint recognition or facial recognition, to ensure that only the owner can access its contents. This could be particularly useful for wallets that hold sensitive information or large amounts of cash, providing peace of mind against theft.",
    "**Wallet with Built-in Organizer**: Create a wallet that includes a built-in organizer for receipts, business cards, and other small items. This could feature expandable pockets or a fold-out design that allows users to easily access and categorize their items. Additionally, incorporating a small notepad or digital display for reminders could enhance organization."
