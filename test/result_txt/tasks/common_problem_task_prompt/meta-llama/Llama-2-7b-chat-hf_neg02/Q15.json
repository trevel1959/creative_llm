    "A Solar-Powered Irrigation System: Create a garden that's both sustainable and efficient by installing a solar-powered irrigation system. This will allow the garden to draw water from a nearby source, such as a well or a rainwater collection system, and use the sun's energy to pump it to the plants. This not only saves water but also reduces the carbon footprint of the garden.",
    "Vertical Garden: Build a wall-mounted garden that utilizes space efficiently by growing plants vertically. This can be done using trellises, arbors, or even a green wall made of living plants. This not only saves space but also adds a unique aesthetic to the backyard.",
    "Rainwater Harvesting System: Create a rainwater harvesting system that collects and stores rainwater for irrigation purposes. This not only reduces the amount of water used from the main water supply but also helps to reduce stormwater runoff and mitigate flooding in the backyard.",
    "Living Fence: Plant a living fence around the perimeter of the backyard using native plants that provide privacy and a natural barrier. This not only adds beauty to the garden but also helps to create a more sustainable ecosystem.",
    "Composting Toilet: Install a composting toilet that converts human waste into a nutrient-rich compost that can be used to fertilize the garden. This not only reduces water usage but also provides a sustainable solution for waste management."
