    "Hot Air Balloon: I would use a hot air balloon to travel in the event that all roads became impassable. Hot air balloons are a great mode of transportation as they can travel over obstacles such as mountains and rivers, and they can also reach high altitudes to avoid any potential hazards on the ground.",
    "Hydrofoil Boat: In the event of impassable roads, I would use a hydrofoil boat to travel. Hydrofoil boats are fast and agile, making them ideal for navigating through rough waters and avoiding any obstacles that may be in the way. They are also capable of traveling long distances without the need for frequent stops, making them a reliable mode of transportation.",
    "Personal Magnetic Levitation Train: If all roads became impassable, I would use a personal magnetic levitation train to travel. Maglev trains use magnetic fields to lift and propel the train, allowing it to move smoothly and efficiently over any surface. This would be especially useful in the event of a catastrophic event such as a massive earthquake or flood, as it would allow me to travel through the affected area without the need for a traditional road.",
    "Bicycle with Floating Wheels: In the event of impassable roads, I would use a bicycle with floating wheels to travel. The floating wheels would allow the bicycle to travel over any surface, including water and rough terrain, making it a versatile and reliable mode of transportation. This would be especially useful in areas where traditional roads are no longer passable, as it would allow me to travel to areas that may be inaccessible by other means.",
    "Personal Jetpack: If all roads became impassable, I would use a personal jetpack to travel. Jetpacks are capable of propelling a person through the air with minimal resistance, allowing for fast and efficient travel over long distances. This would be especially useful in the event of a catastrophic event such as a massive earthquake or flood, as it"
