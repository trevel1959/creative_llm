    "**Beachy Bouncy Castle**: Imagine a gigantic, inflatable bouncy castle that covers the entire beach. The castle's surface is made of a special, water-repellent material that allows people to bounce around on it while staying dry. The castle has different sections with varying levels of bounce, from soft and gentle to super bouncy and thrilling. You can jump, flip, and play games like \"King of the Castle\" or \"Beachy Bouncy Tag\" with friends and family.",
    "**Underwater City**: With all the sand gone, the beach becomes a vast, shallow lake. You could build an underwater city with towering structures, colorful gardens, and winding canals. The city would be designed for humans to live and work in, with air-filled bubbles and pressurized buildings that allow people to move around comfortably. You could explore the city by swimming or using a specialized, submersible vehicle.",
    "**Floating Gardens**: Envision a beach where the sand has been replaced by a series of interconnected, floating gardens. Each garden is a large, circular platform made of a lightweight, buoyant material that's anchored to the seafloor. The gardens would be filled with lush greenery, colorful flowers, and towering trees, creating a serene and peaceful atmosphere. You could stroll through the gardens, enjoying the sights and sounds of nature, or use them as a base for water sports like kayaking or paddleboarding.",
    "**Beachy Boardwalk**: Picture a beach with a massive, elevated boardwalk that stretches along the shoreline. The boardwalk is made of a sturdy, weather-resistant material and features a series of shops, restaurants, and entertainment venues. You could walk along the boardwalk, taking in the ocean views and enjoying the breeze, or stop at one of the many food stalls to try some delicious beach treats. The boardwalk would also host various events and activities, like concerts, festivals, and beach volleyball tournaments.",
    "**Water Park**: Imagine a beach where the sand has been transformed into a massive water park. The park would feature a series of interconnected water slides, wave pools, and lazy rivers. You could spend the day splashing around, trying out different water attractions, or relaxing in a shaded area with a cold drink. The water park would also have a variety of amenities, like cabanas, restaurants, and shops selling beach gear and souvenirs. [/INST] "
