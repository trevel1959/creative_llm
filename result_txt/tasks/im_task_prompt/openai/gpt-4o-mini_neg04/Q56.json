    "**Customizable Sound Options**: Develop a bicycle bell that allows users to customize the sound it produces. This could be done through a companion app where users can choose from various tones, melodies, or even upload their own sounds. This personalization can make the bell more enjoyable to use and help riders express their individuality while riding.",
    "**Integrated LED Light System**: Combine the bicycle bell with an LED light system that activates when the bell is rung. The lights could flash in different colors or patterns to increase visibility, especially during low-light conditions. This dual functionality enhances safety by alerting both pedestrians and motorists while providing additional lighting for the cyclist.",
    "**Voice-Activated Bell**: Create a voice-activated bicycle bell that responds to specific voice commands. For instance, the rider could say \"ring bell\" or \"alert\" to activate the bell, allowing for hands-free operation. This feature is particularly useful for cyclists who need to keep both hands on the handlebars while navigating busy streets.",
    "**Solar-Powered Charging**: Design a bicycle bell that incorporates solar panels to charge an internal battery. This eco-friendly feature ensures that the bell remains powered without the need for batteries, making it more sustainable. The solar-powered bell could also have a low battery indicator to remind users when it needs to be charged.",
    "**Multi-Functional Control Panel**: Create a bicycle bell that includes a small control panel with buttons for additional functions, such as a horn, turn signals, or a small display showing speed or distance. This all-in-one device would minimize the need for multiple gadgets on the bike and streamline the riding experience."
