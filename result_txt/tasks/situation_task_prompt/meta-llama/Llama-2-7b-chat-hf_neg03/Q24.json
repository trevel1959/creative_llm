    "Glasses-free Vision Aids: Develop a revolutionary new technology that uses augmented reality (AR) or virtual reality (VR) to enhance vision. These devices could be worn like regular glasses but with the added capability of correcting vision without the need for actual lenses. The technology could use a combination of sensors, cameras, and AI algorithms to detect and correct refractive errors, allowing people with poor vision to see clearly without any physical lenses.",
    "Corneal Implants: Advances in medical technology could lead to the development of corneal implants that can be implanted into the eye to correct vision. These implants could be made of biocompatible materials and designed to mimic the natural shape and function of the cornea, allowing people with poor vision to see clearly without glasses or contacts.",
    "Brain-Computer Interfaces: Harness the power of brain-computer interfaces (BCIs) to develop devices that can read brain signals and translate them into visual information. These devices could be worn like headbands or used as contact lenses, allowing people with poor vision to control a virtual display that enhances their vision. The BCIs could be trained to recognize specific brain signals associated with different visual tasks, such as reading or recognizing faces.",
    "Artificial Retinas: Advances in nanotechnology could lead to the development of artificial retinas that can be implanted into the eye to restore vision. These retinas could be made of nanoparticles that mimic the structure and function of the natural retina, allowing light to be detected and converted into electrical signals that can be interpreted by the brain.",
    "Genetic Engineering: Gene editing technologies like CRISPR could be used to correct genetic mutations that cause vision problems. By editing the genes responsible for vision, scientists could potentially restore vision to people with inherited eye conditions. This approach could also be used to enhance vision in people without genetic eye conditions, allowing them to see more clearly than ever before."
