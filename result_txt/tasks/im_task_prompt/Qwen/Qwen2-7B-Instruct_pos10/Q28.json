    "**Bike Helmet as a Multi-Functional Outdoor Gear**: Design a bicycle helmet that transforms into various outdoor gear. For instance, when not used for cycling, it can be converted into a backpack or a hydration pack, equipped with compartments for carrying essentials like snacks, water bottles, and other small items. This concept not only maximizes utility but also reduces the need for multiple items of gear.",
    "**Bike Helmet as an Emergency Communication Device**: Integrate a built-in communication system into the helmet. It could feature a Bluetooth speaker and microphone, allowing cyclists to communicate with each other or receive emergency alerts. This would significantly enhance safety on the road, especially for group rides or in areas with poor visibility.",
    "**Customizable Bike Helmets**: Develop a system where users can personalize their helmets with custom graphics, designs, or even add-ons like LED lights or speakers. This not only enhances the aesthetic appeal but also allows cyclists to express their personality and style. Additionally, this could foster a sense of community among cyclists who share similar designs or themes.",
    "**Eco-Friendly Bike Helmets**: Use sustainable materials in the production of bike helmets, such as recycled plastics, organic cotton, or biodegradable foam. Implement a recycling program where old helmets are collected and repurposed or recycled, reducing environmental impact. This idea aligns with the growing trend towards eco-conscious products and supports a circular economy.",
    "**Health Monitoring Bike Helmets**: Incorporate health monitoring technology into the helmet, such as heart rate monitors, sweat sensors, and motion trackers. This would allow cyclists to monitor their physical condition during rides, helping prevent overexertion and ensuring they maintain optimal performance. Data from these sensors could be synced with mobile apps, providing insights into workout intensity, calorie burn, and recovery times, enhancing the overall user experience."
