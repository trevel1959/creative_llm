    "**Built-in Recipe Suggestion Feature**: Equip the refrigerator with a touchscreen interface that suggests recipes based on the ingredients available inside. By scanning the RFID tags or using a barcode scanner, the fridge could generate meal ideas, complete with cooking instructions and estimated prep times. This would encourage home cooking and help users utilize ingredients before they spoil.",
    "**Energy-Efficient Cooling Zones**: Design the refrigerator with customizable cooling zones that can be adjusted based on the type of food stored. For instance, fruits and vegetables could be kept in a slightly warmer zone to preserve freshness, while dairy products and meats could be in colder zones. Users could control these settings via a smartphone app, optimizing energy consumption and food preservation.",
    "**Integrated Water Filtration and Infusion System**: Incorporate a water filtration system within the refrigerator that allows users to infuse their water with fruits, herbs, or other flavors. The fridge could have a designated compartment for fresh ingredients, and users could dispense flavored water directly from the refrigerator. This would promote hydration and encourage healthier beverage choices.",
    "**Dynamic Temperature Control**: Implement a dynamic temperature control system that adjusts the temperature based on the items stored inside. For example, if a user places a large pot of warm food inside, the fridge could temporarily lower its temperature to quickly cool down the item, ensuring food safety. This feature could also help in maintaining optimal temperatures for specific food types.",
    "**Mood Lighting and Aesthetic Customization**: Add customizable LED mood lighting to the interior of the refrigerator that can change colors based on user preferences or the time of day. Users could choose a warm light for evening snacks or a bright, cool light for daytime cooking. Additionally, the exterior could have interchangeable panels or skins, allowing users to personalize the look of their refrigerator to match their kitchen decor."
