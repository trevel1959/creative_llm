    "**Human-Powered Ladder**: Build or install a long, sturdy ladder that spirals around the outside of the building, similar to a climbing wall. This ladder could be manually ascended using climbing equipment like harnesses, ropes, and carabiners. It requires physical strength, skill, and safety training, but it's a feasible solution for those who are fit and experienced in climbing. Confidence Score: 0.9",
    "**Vertical Zip Line System**: Design and install a series of zip lines connected to each floor, with a pulley system that allows riders to ascend at a controlled speed. This system would need to be anchored securely to the building's structure, ensuring it can withstand high winds and other environmental factors. Riders would use safety gear, including helmets, harnesses, and gloves. Confidence Score: 0.8",
    "**Air Balloon Escape Pod**: Create an escape pod that uses helium-filled balloons to lift individuals up the side of the building. The pod would have a small opening for entry and exit, as well as windows for visibility. It could also include basic survival supplies and emergency communication devices. Safety would depend on the weight capacity of the balloons and their ability to handle wind conditions. Confidence Score: 0.7",
    "**Water Slide Up the Building**: Construct a large water slide that runs along the exterior of the skyscraper, starting from the ground level and ending near the top. Riders would wear life jackets and follow safety protocols, such as wearing a helmet and holding onto a safety rope. This option is unique and potentially fun, but it poses significant safety concerns regarding water flow, structural integrity, and potential hazards like debris or obstacles. Confidence Score: 0.6",
    "**Skywalk Ramps**: Install a series of ramps that start from the ground and gradually increase in height, leading to the top of the building. These ramps could be made of lightweight materials and designed to be easily assembled and disassembled. They would provide a safe and accessible way to reach the top, but they would require careful planning to ensure stability and support under the weight of multiple users. Confidence Score: 0.8"
