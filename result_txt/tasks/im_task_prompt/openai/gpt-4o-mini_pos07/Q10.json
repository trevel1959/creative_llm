    "**Built-in Projector**: Integrate a mini projector into the laptop, allowing users to project their screen onto a wall or any flat surface. This would be particularly useful for presentations, collaborative work, or watching movies. The projector could be retractable and powered by the laptopâ€™s battery, with a focus on energy efficiency and high-quality resolution.",
    "**Eco-Friendly Materials**: Design a laptop using sustainable and biodegradable materials. This could include casings made from recycled plastics or organic composites that break down over time. Additionally, the laptop could feature a modular design, allowing users to replace parts easily, reducing electronic waste and promoting longevity.",
    "**Health Monitoring Sensors**: Incorporate health monitoring sensors into the laptop that track the user's posture, eye strain, and overall health metrics while they work. The laptop could provide real-time feedback and suggestions for breaks, stretches, or posture corrections, promoting better ergonomics and well-being during extended use.",
    "**Wireless Charging Pad**: Equip the laptop with a built-in wireless charging pad on the surface. Users could place their smartphones or other compatible devices on the laptop to charge while working. This would eliminate the need for additional chargers and cables, creating a cleaner workspace and enhancing convenience.",
    "**Dynamic Cooling System**: Develop a laptop with an intelligent cooling system that adjusts its cooling mechanisms based on the workload and ambient temperature. This could involve using phase change materials that absorb heat during heavy use and release it when the laptop is idle, ensuring optimal performance without excessive noise or energy consumption."
