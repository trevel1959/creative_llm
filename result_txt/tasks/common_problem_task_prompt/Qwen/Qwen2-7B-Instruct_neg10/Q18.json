    "**Limited Entertainment Options**: Electricity powers most forms of entertainment like TVs, computers, and smartphones. Without it, people would have to resort to more manual activities for entertainment, such as reading books, playing board games, or engaging in outdoor sports. This could lead to a decline in screen time and potentially increase physical activity levels.",
    "**Health Concerns**: Medical equipment and devices, including refrigerators used for storing medicines and vaccines, would not function without electricity. This could result in health crises, particularly in regions lacking reliable medical facilities. Additionally, maintaining personal hygiene might become difficult due to a lack of electric water heaters and other appliances.",
    "**Safety and Security Issues**: Electricity powers streetlights, CCTV cameras, and alarm systems, all of which are crucial for public safety. Without them, areas might become unsafe at night, increasing crime rates. Additionally, security systems like door locks and alarms might not work properly, leading to higher risks of home invasions.",
    "**Economic Impact**: Industries dependent on electricity, such as manufacturing, food processing, and technology, would suffer significant disruptions. The lack of power could halt production processes, leading to economic losses and potential job loss. Furthermore, businesses might struggle to maintain inventory and supply chains, affecting their ability to serve customers.",
    "**Environmental Effects**: Electricity generation often relies on fossil fuels, which contribute to greenhouse gas emissions. Without electricity, there would be a reduction in carbon footprint. However, this could also impact industries like mining and transportation that depend on fossil fuels. Additionally, some rural areas might revert to using more traditional energy sources, like wood or charcoal, which can lead to deforestation and air pollution."
