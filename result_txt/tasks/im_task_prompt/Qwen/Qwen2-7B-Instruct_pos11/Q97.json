    "**Smart Dog Leash**: Design a smart leash that integrates with a smartphone app. The leash would include GPS tracking to monitor your dog's location, as well as sensors that can detect if your dog is being aggressive or showing signs of stress. This way, you can receive alerts on your phone in real-time, allowing you to take appropriate action quickly. Additionally, it could have a built-in light for night walks and a speaker to play commands or calming sounds.",
    "**Biodegradable Dog Leash**: Create a dog leash made from eco-friendly materials such as bamboo, hemp, or recycled plastics. This product would be environmentally friendly and reduce the impact of pet ownership on the planet. It would also be more durable than traditional leashes and provide better comfort for both the owner and the dog.",
    "**Customizable Dog Leash with Removable Pouches**: Design a leash with multiple pouches that can be attached and detached easily. These pouches can hold treats, poop bags, or any other items your dog might need during a walk. The leash itself can come in various designs and colors, allowing owners to customize their dog's look while providing practical functionality.",
    "**Adjustable and Expandable Dog Leash**: Create a leash that can be adjusted to different lengths based on the environment and the dog's needs. For example, it could expand into a longer line when you're in an open space like a park and shorten to a standard leash length when walking through crowded areas. This would offer flexibility without compromising safety.",
    "**Interactive Dog Leash with Training Tools**: Develop a leash that doubles as a training tool. It could feature built-in clicker mechanisms, vibration or gentle pulse stimulators, and even a small bell or whistle that can be used to train specific behaviors. This would be especially useful for dog owners who are new to training or want to enhance their current training regimen without needing additional equipment."
