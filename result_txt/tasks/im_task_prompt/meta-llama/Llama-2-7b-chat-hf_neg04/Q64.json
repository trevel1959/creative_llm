    "Smart Sensory Alarm: This alarm system utilizes various sensors, such as motion detectors, temperature sensors, and humidity sensors, to detect potential threats. It can detect smoke, carbon monoxide, and even intruders, and alert the user through a mobile app or voice assistant.",
    "Artificial Intelligence Alarm: This system incorporates AI technology to learn the user's daily routine and habits, and can detect abnormalities that may indicate a potential threat. For example, if the user typically sleeps between 10 PM and 7 AM, but the alarm goes off at 3 AM, the AI system will recognize this as an anomaly and alert the user.",
    "Biometric Alarm: This alarm system uses biometric data, such as fingerprints, facial recognition, or heart rate, to identify the user and determine if they are in danger. If the system detects an irregularity, it will alert the user or emergency services.",
    "Environmental Alarm: This alarm system takes into account the user's location and the surrounding environment to detect potential threats. For example, if the user is in a flood-prone area, the system will detect the flood and alert the user.",
    "Virtual Reality Alarm: This system uses virtual reality technology to create a simulated environment that mimics real-life situations. The user can experience a virtual environment that simulates a fire, earthquake, or other disaster, and the alarm will sound if the user fails to respond appropriately."
