    "**Creating a Shelter**: Your first priority is to find or create a shelter to protect yourself from the elements. You can build a shelter using natural resources available on the island such as palm leaves for a thatched roof, branches for walls, and a nearby cave if available. This shelter will provide protection from rain, sun, and potentially wild animals.",
    "**Water Collection and Purification**: Water is crucial for survival. You can collect rainwater in large containers or create a simple water collection system using leaves or rocks. For purification, you could boil water, use sand or charcoal filters, or try to catch rainwater during the night, which tends to be cleaner.",
    "**Starting a Fire**: A fire can provide warmth, cook food, and help scare off predators. Learn basic fire-making techniques such as the flint and steel method or creating friction using a bow drill. Keep a supply of tinder (like dry grass, leaves, or bark) close by.",
    "**Wild Food and Water Sources**: Learn to identify edible plants and fruits that are safe to eat. Additionally, you should look for sources of fresh water like streams or rivers, and if possible, catch fish or other aquatic life for protein.",
    "**Building a Signal Device**: To attract attention from passing ships or planes, you'll need to create a signal device. Use materials like mirrors, reflective metals, or even white clothing to reflect sunlight and send distress signals. You can also create a large cross or SOS message with rocks or driftwood if visible from the air."
