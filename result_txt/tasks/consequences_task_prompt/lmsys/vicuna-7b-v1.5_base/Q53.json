    "Environmental impact would be lessened: The faster rate of biodegradation would help to mitigate the negative environmental impacts of plastic waste, such as the harm it causes to wildlife and ecosystems. Plants and animals would be less likely to ingest or become entangled in plastic debris, leading to a reduction in the number of casualties.",
    "Cost savings for waste management: Faster biodegradation would simplify waste management processes, as plastic waste would not need to be stored for extended periods. This could result in cost savings for local governments and waste management companies, as they would not need to invest in long-term storage solutions.",
    "Increased use of biodegradable alternatives: As plastic becomes less prevalent, there would be a greater incentive to develop and use biodegradable alternatives. This could lead to a shift towards more sustainable materials in various industries, such as packaging, textiles, and construction.",
    "Economic benefits from plastic recycling: Faster biodegradation would increase the demand for recycled plastic, as it would no longer be a long-term storage solution. This could create new economic opportunities and jobs in the recycling industry, as well as incentivize the development of more efficient recycling technologies.",
    "Improved public awareness and behavior: If plastic waste were to biodegrade more quickly, there would be a greater emphasis on reducing plastic usage and properly disposing of it. This could lead to a cultural shift in public awareness and behavior, with individuals and businesses taking more responsibility for their plastic waste."
