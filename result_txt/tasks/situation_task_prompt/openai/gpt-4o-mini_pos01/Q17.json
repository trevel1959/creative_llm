    "**Water Filtration Systems**: Create a network of rainwater harvesting and filtration systems. Use large barrels to collect rainwater, and implement natural filtration methods, such as sand and charcoal filters, to ensure clean drinking water. This could be a community effort, with each household contributing to the maintenance and expansion of the system, fostering a sense of cooperation and shared responsibility.",
    "**Bioluminescent Gardens**: Develop a garden using bioluminescent plants, which can be genetically engineered or selectively bred to glow in the dark. These plants would provide natural lighting for pathways and gathering spaces at night. The glow could also serve as a natural indicator for different zones in the garden, making it both functional and beautiful.",
    "**Traditional Farming Techniques**: Revert to ancient farming methods that do not rely on electricity, such as permaculture and crop rotation. Encourage the community to form cooperatives for planting, harvesting, and sharing produce. Organizing seasonal festivals to celebrate the harvest can strengthen community bonds and ensure that everyone has access to food.",
    "**Wind-Powered Tools**: Design and build simple wind-powered tools and machines for tasks like grinding grain or pumping water. By using basic mechanics, communities can harness wind energy to facilitate daily chores. Creating workshops to teach people how to build and maintain these tools would empower them to become self-sufficient.",
    "**Community Trading System**: Establish a barter system where goods and services are exchanged without the need for currency. This could involve creating a marketplace where people can trade produce, handmade goods, or skills. A digital ledger could be replaced by a physical one, such as a chalkboard or ledger book, where transactions are recorded, fostering trust and cooperation among community members."
