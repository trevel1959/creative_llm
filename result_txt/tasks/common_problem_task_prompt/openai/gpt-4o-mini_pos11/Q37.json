    "**Budget Overruns**: Art exhibitions often require significant funding, and costs can quickly spiral out of control. Problems may arise from unexpected expenses such as higher-than-anticipated venue rental fees, costs for insurance, promotional materials, or catering for opening receptions. Without a well-planned budget and contingency funds, organizers may find themselves struggling to cover all expenses, which could jeopardize the quality of the exhibition.",
    "**Artist Coordination and Communication**: Engaging with multiple artists can lead to miscommunication regarding timelines, artwork specifications, and installation preferences. Problems might include artists not delivering their pieces on time, conflicting schedules for installation, or differing expectations about how their work should be displayed. Clear communication channels and a structured timeline are essential to prevent misunderstandings.",
    "**Marketing and Audience Engagement**: Attracting visitors to the exhibition can be a challenge, especially in a saturated market. Problems may arise from ineffective marketing strategies, lack of targeted outreach, or failure to utilize social media effectively. Additionally, if the exhibition does not resonate with the intended audience, it may result in low attendance, impacting both the artists' exposure and potential sales.",
    "**Insurance and Liability Issues**: Protecting the artworks and the venue from damage or theft is a significant concern. Problems could include inadequate insurance coverage, which may leave organizers liable for any loss or damage. Additionally, safety issues such as fire hazards or insufficient crowd control measures could pose risks to both visitors and artworks, leading to legal repercussions.",
    "**Curatorial Challenges**: The process of selecting and arranging artworks for the exhibition can present challenges. Problems might include a lack of cohesive theme or narrative, which could confuse or disengage visitors. Additionally, the curator must consider how to display the art effectively, ensuring that it is both visually appealing and accessible, which can be a complex balancing act."
