    "**Adaptive Fit Technology**: Using memory foam and adjustable straps that automatically conform to the shape of the rider's head, this helmet would ensure a perfect fit every time. The adaptive fit technology could include sensors that detect pressure points and adjust the padding accordingly, providing enhanced comfort and safety during rides.",
    "**Solar-Powered Safety Lights**: Incorporating small solar panels into the design of the helmet could power LED lights embedded in the back and sides. These lights would enhance visibility during low-light conditions, automatically turning on at dusk and off at dawn. This would promote safety without the need for batteries, making it environmentally friendly.",
    "**Cooling and Ventilation System**: A built-in cooling system that utilizes small, silent fans could help regulate temperature inside the helmet during hot weather. Additionally, adjustable vents would allow riders to control airflow, keeping them comfortable on long rides while preventing overheating.",
    "**Impact-Resistant Modular Design**: This helmet could feature a modular design where different components can be swapped out based on the type of cycling activity (e.g., road cycling, mountain biking). The outer shell could be made of a new impact-resistant material that absorbs shock better than traditional helmets, providing enhanced protection in various cycling environments.",
    "**Augmented Reality (AR) Integration**: An AR-enabled helmet could provide real-time data such as speed, distance traveled, and heart rate displayed on the visor. It could also offer alerts for obstacles or hazards detected by sensors, allowing cyclists to stay informed about their surroundings without looking away from the road."
