    "**Innovative Umbrella with Solar Panels**: Create an umbrella that not only protects against rain but also charges your electronic devices. The canopy would be made of solar cells that can absorb sunlight during the day. When folded or stored indoors, the umbrella could be connected to a USB port for charging phones, tablets, or other gadgets. This idea is particularly useful in sunny regions where there's a high demand for portable power sources.",
    "**Umbrella-Integrated Smart Weather Forecasting System**: Design an umbrella with built-in sensors that monitor the weather conditions. The device could detect changes in temperature, humidity, and air pressure to predict upcoming weather patterns. It might have a small display on the handle showing weather forecasts or alerts, such as thunderstorms or sudden drops in temperature. This could help users prepare accordingly and potentially avoid getting caught in unexpected weather.",
    "**Self-Cleaning Umbrella**: Develop an umbrella that uses nanotechnology to repel water and dirt, making it self-cleaning. The fabric could be coated with a special nano-material that breaks down oils and dirt upon contact, allowing the umbrella to be wiped clean easily. This reduces the need for frequent washing and maintenance, which is especially beneficial for those who frequently use umbrellas in rainy climates.",
    "**Adjustable Umbrella with Variable Size and Shape**: Create an umbrella that can change its size and shape based on the weather conditions or user preference. For example, in heavy rain, the umbrella expands to provide more coverage, while in lighter showers or sun, it can contract to be more compact and less cumbersome. This versatility could enhance both practicality and convenience for various situations.",
    "**Umbrella with Built-In Air Purification**: Integrate a small air purifier into the umbrella frame, which can help clean the air around the user when walking in polluted urban environments. This could be particularly useful for individuals sensitive to allergens or pollutants. The air purifier might use HEPA filters or other advanced technologies to trap particles and improve air quality, providing a healthier environment under the umbrella."
