    "**Augmented Reality (AR) Calculator**: An AR calculator app that overlays digital information onto the real world through a smartphone or AR glasses. Users could point their device at physical objects to measure dimensions, calculate areas, or determine angles in real-time. For example, pointing at a rectangular table could instantly provide the area, perimeter, and even suggest how many tablecloths would fit based on different sizes.",
    "**Interactive Learning Mode**: A calculator that features an interactive learning mode designed for students. This mode could include quizzes, challenges, and problem-solving games that adapt to the user's skill level. By incorporating gamification, students would be more engaged in practicing their math skills, and the calculator could track progress over time, offering personalized recommendations for improvement.",
    "**Customizable Interface**: A calculator that allows users to customize the interface according to their preferences. Users could choose different themes, button layouts, and color schemes, making the device more visually appealing and easier to use. Additionally, it could include a modular design where users can add or remove features, such as scientific functions or graphing capabilities, based on their specific needs.",
    "**Environmental Impact Calculator**: A calculator designed to help users understand the environmental impact of their choices. For example, when calculating costs, it could also provide insights into the carbon footprint of a particular product or service. This could encourage more sustainable decision-making, such as choosing eco-friendly alternatives or understanding the long-term benefits of energy-efficient options.",
    "**Multi-Language Support with Cultural Context**: A calculator that not only supports multiple languages but also provides cultural context for mathematical problems. For instance, when calculating tips in different countries, the calculator could explain customary practices and rounding norms. This feature would be especially useful for travelers or international students, helping them navigate math in various cultural settings."
