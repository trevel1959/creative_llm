    "Sleep in a light-controlled room: If there were no more night-time, it would be difficult to fall asleep as our bodies are naturally programmed to sleep during the night. However, one solution could be to sleep in a room that is designed to simulate a natural night-time environment. This could include using blackout curtains, dimming the lights, and using a white noise machine to simulate the sounds of a sleeping environment.",
    "Take naps during the day: Another option would be to take short naps during the day instead of trying to sleep at night. This could be particularly helpful for people who work long hours or have busy schedules.",
    "Use natural light: If you're unable to control the light in your room, you could try using natural light to help you sleep. This could involve opening your curtains or blinds to let in some sunlight, or even sleeping outside if you have access to a safe outdoor space.",
    "Use aromatherapy: Certain scents, such as lavender or chamomile, are known to help people relax and fall asleep. You could try using an essential oil diffuser or adding a few drops of your favorite relaxing scent to your pillow to help you sleep.",
    "Practice relaxation techniques: There are many relaxation techniques that can help you fall asleep, such as deep breathing, meditation, or progressive muscle relaxation. By practicing these techniques regularly, you may be able to fall asleep more easily even if there is no night-time."
