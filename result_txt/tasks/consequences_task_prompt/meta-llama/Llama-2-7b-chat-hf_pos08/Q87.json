    "Genetic diversity: Cloning extinct animals would increase genetic diversity by introducing new genetic material into the existing species. This could lead to the creation of new traits and adaptations that could benefit the ecosystem.",
    "Conservation: Cloning extinct animals could be a way to restore populations of endangered species and potentially save them from extinction. This could have a positive impact on the ecosystem and preserve biodiversity.",
    "Economic benefits: Cloning extinct animals could provide a new source of revenue through the sale of cloned animals and their byproducts. This could also lead to the creation of new industries and job opportunities.",
    "Ethical concerns: Cloning extinct animals raises ethical concerns about the treatment and welfare of the cloned animals. There is also the possibility of unintended consequences, such as the cloned animals not being able to adapt to their environment or causing harm to other species.",
    "Ecological imbalance: Cloning extinct animals could disrupt the ecological balance of the ecosystem. For example, if a cloned species is introduced into an ecosystem, it could potentially outcompete native species for resources, leading to a decline in biodiversity."
