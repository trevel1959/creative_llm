    "**Smart Trash Can for Office Productivity**: Develop a smart trash can that can sort recyclables and non-recyclables automatically. This could be achieved through an integrated sensor system that recognizes the type of waste thrown in. It could also include features like full bin alerts, waste management scheduling, and eco-friendly reminders (like suggesting to reduce printing). This not only helps in reducing environmental impact but also promotes a more organized workspace.",
    "**Interactive Trash Can for Children's Education**: Create an interactive trash can designed for children's learning centers or schools. The trash can could have different compartments each labeled with different types of waste (food scraps, paper, plastic, etc.). Inside each compartment, there could be a QR code linking to educational content about recycling and waste management. This would make learning about waste management fun and engaging for kids.",
    "**Biodegradable Trash Bags for Home Use**: Design trash bags made from biodegradable materials like corn starch or plant fibers. These bags can be used in households to encourage more sustainable waste disposal. They break down faster than traditional plastic bags, reducing landfill waste and pollution. The bags could come in attractive designs and sizes to match different household needs, promoting eco-consciousness in daily life.",
    "**Trash Can Recycling Challenge**: Organize a community-wide challenge where participants are encouraged to reduce their waste output and recycle more effectively. Participants can use a smart trash can that tracks their recycling efforts, offering points for correct sorting and additional incentives for meeting recycling goals. This fosters a sense of competition and community engagement in waste reduction.",
    "**Wearable Trash Can for Personal Convenience**: Invent a wearable device that functions as a small trash can. This could be a belt or a wristband with a built-in receptacle, perfect for outdoor activities or crowded public places where traditional trash cans are not readily available. It could also include a sensor that alerts when it's full, encouraging the user to dispose of waste properly. This promotes cleanliness and convenience while on the go."
