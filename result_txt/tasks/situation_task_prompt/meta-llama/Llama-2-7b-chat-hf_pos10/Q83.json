    "Retractable Eyelids: In a world without nighttime, I would invent retractable eyelids that could cover and protect the eyes during the day. This would allow individuals to rest and recharge without the need for sleep. The eyelids would be designed with a special gel-like substance that could absorb and filter out any light, ensuring a peaceful and restful state.",
    "Light-Resistant Sleep Pods: I would create portable, light-resistant sleep pods that could be used anywhere, anytime. These pods would be made of a special material that could block out all light, allowing individuals to sleep soundly even during the day. They would also have built-in sound-absorbing technology to ensure a peaceful sleep environment.",
    "Mindfulness-Based Sleep Techniques: In a world without nighttime, I would focus on developing mindfulness-based sleep techniques that would help individuals relax and fall asleep without the need for darkness. These techniques would involve guided meditation, deep breathing exercises, and progressive muscle relaxation, all designed to promote relaxation and calmness.",
    "Circadian Rhythm Regulation: To regulate the body's internal clock without the influence of night and day, I would develop a wearable device that could simulate the body's natural circadian rhythm. This device would use a combination of light, sound, and vibration to signal the body when it's time to sleep, eat, and be active, ensuring a consistent and healthy sleep-wake cycle.",
    "Sleep-Promoting Virtual Reality: In a world without nighttime, I would create immersive virtual reality experiences that would help individuals relax and fall asleep. These experiences would be designed to create a peaceful and calming environment, complete with soothing sounds, gentle lighting, and calming visuals. By fully immersing the senses, these experiences would help individuals fall asleep faster and stay asleep longer."
