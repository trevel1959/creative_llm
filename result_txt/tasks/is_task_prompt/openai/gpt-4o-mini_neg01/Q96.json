    "Long ago, in a realm of flying witches, there was a young witch named Lira who lacked a broomstick.

To her surprise, the winds answered, swirling around her and forming a cyclone that dispersed the dark cloud. The villagers watched in awe, realizing that Mabel's connection to nature was far more powerful than any broomstick. They celebrated her as their guardian, the witch of the winds.",
    "In a quaint village, a witch named Greta lived without a broomstick, using her wit and charm instead. One day, a greedy merchant arrived, trying to steal the village’s magic.

While he slumbered, she gathered the villagers and created a protective barrier around their home. When the merchant awoke, he found himself trapped in a cage of vines. The villagers cheered for Greta, who showed them that sometimes, brains outshine brawn—and that a broomstick isn’t necessary to outsmart a foe."
