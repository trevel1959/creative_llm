    "**Power Supply Limitations**: Another potential problem is selecting an inadequate power supply unit (PSU). If the PSU doesn't provide enough wattage or the correct power connectors for the components, the system may fail to boot or could become unstable. It's crucial to calculate the total power requirements of all components and choose a PSU that exceeds that requirement by a reasonable margin (typically 20-30%).",
    "**Static Electricity Damage**: When handling sensitive components like the CPU and RAM, static electricity can cause irreversible damage. This issue can arise if the builder doesn't take precautions such as using an anti-static wrist strap or working on a non-static surface. To prevent this, always ground yourself before touching any components and avoid working on carpets or other static-prone surfaces.",
    "**Cooling System Challenges**: Overheating can be a significant issue, especially if the cooling system is not adequately designed for the components used. If the CPU or GPU doesn't have sufficient cooling, it may throttle performance or even damage itself. To address this, it's essential to research and select appropriate cooling solutions (air coolers, liquid cooling) based on the thermal output of the components and ensure proper airflow within the case.",
    "**Software Installation Hurdles**: After successfully assembling the hardware, installing the operating system and drivers can present challenges. Issues such as boot errors, missing drivers, or BIOS configuration problems may arise. To overcome these challenges, it's advisable to prepare a bootable USB drive with the operating system beforehand and ensure that all necessary drivers are downloaded from the manufacturer's website.",
    "**Cable Management and Aesthetics**: Poor cable management can lead to airflow issues, making cooling less effective and creating a cluttered appearance. Additionally, tangled cables can make troubleshooting more difficult. To resolve this, builders should plan cable routing before installation, use zip ties or Velcro straps for organization, and consider modular PSUs that allow for selective cable usage."
