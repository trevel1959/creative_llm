    "Time-keeping through nature: People could rely on natural phenomena like the sun's movement, the changing of seasons, and the behavior of animals to keep track of time. For example, people could use the position of the sun to determine when it was morning or afternoon, or they could observe the migration patterns of birds to mark the passing of the seasons.",
    "Time-keeping through technology: In a world without clocks and watches, humans would have to develop new technologies to keep track of time. One idea could be to create a device that uses light or sound waves to measure time. Another idea could be to develop a system that uses magnetic fields to keep track of the passage of time.",
    "Time-keeping through art: People could use art to keep track of time. For example, they could create paintings or sculptures that depict different times of day or year, or they could create murals that show the passage of time over long periods of time.",
    "Time-keeping through social norms: People could rely on social norms and traditions to keep track of time. For example, they could establish customs around meal times or religious ceremonies as a way to mark the passage of time.",
    "Time-keeping through storytelling: People could tell stories about events in the past to keep track of time. For example, they could retell tales of ancient civilizations or historical events to give people a sense of how much time has passed since those events occurred."
