    "Wrist-based blood pressure monitoring system: A smartwatch that can monitor the wearer's blood pressure by using a built-in blood pressure sensor. This feature would be especially useful for people with hypertension or other cardiovascular conditions, as it would allow them to monitor their blood pressure on a regular basis without having to visit a clinic. The watch could also provide real-time feedback and alerts if the wearer's blood pressure exceeds a certain threshold, allowing them to seek medical attention if necessary.",
    "Wrist-based virtual reality interface: A smartwatch that includes a built-in virtual reality (VR) interface, allowing the wearer to control VR experiences with their wrist movements. This could be particularly useful for gaming or entertainment applications, as it would allow users to immerse themselves in a virtual world without the need for a separate VR headset. The watch could also include sensors to track the wearer's hand movements, allowing for more precise control of virtual objects.",
    "Wrist-based mental health monitoring system: A smartwatch that includes sensors to monitor the wearer's mental health by tracking their heart rate, skin conductance, and other physiological parameters. The watch could also include AI-powered algorithms to detect changes in the wearer's mental state, such as stress or anxiety, and provide real-time feedback and recommendations for managing these conditions. This could be especially useful for people with mental health conditions, as it would allow them to monitor their mental health on a regular basis and receive personalized support and guidance.",
    "Wrist-based fitness tracking with AI-powered coaching: A smartwatch that includes advanced fitness tracking features, such as GPS, heart rate monitoring, and motion sensors. However, the watch would also include AI-powered coaching algorithms that use machine learning to analyze the wearer's fitness data and provide personalized workout recommendations based on their fitness level, goals, and preferences. This could be particularly useful for people who struggle to stay motivated with their fitness routines, as the AI-powered coaching would provide tailored support and guidance to help them achieve their fitness goals.",
    "Wrist-based biometric authentication: A smartwatch that includes advanced biometric authentication capabilities, such as fingerprint recognition,"
