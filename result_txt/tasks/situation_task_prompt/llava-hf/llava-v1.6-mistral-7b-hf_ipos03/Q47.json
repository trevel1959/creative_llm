    "Hairless Headband: Another idea is to wear a hairless headband that is made from a UV-protective fabric. The headband would cover the head and prevent sunburn while still allowing for some air circulation.",
    "Sunscreen: Another option is to apply sunscreen with a high SPF to the scalp and neck area to protect against sunburn. This would require regular reapplication throughout the day, but it could be an effective solution for those who don't want to wear a hat or headband.",
    "Scalp Cooling Towel: A scalp cooling towel could be an effective solution for protecting the head from sunburn. The towel would be made from a moisture-wicking fabric that could be soaked in cold water and wrapped around the head to provide shade and coolness.",
    "UV-Protective Shirt: A shirt with a high collar and long sleeves could be another option for protecting the head from sunburn. The shirt would provide shade and cover the neck area, making it a practical solution for those who spend a lot of time outdoors.",
    "Sunglasses Hat: A hat that has sunglasses integrated into it could be a practical solution for protecting the head from sunburn. The sunglasses would provide shade for the eyes and forehead, while the hat would protect the scalp and neck area."
