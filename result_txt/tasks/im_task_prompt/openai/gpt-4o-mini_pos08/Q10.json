    "**Integrated Solar Charging Panel**: Incorporate a lightweight, flexible solar panel into the laptop's lid that can charge the battery while the device is in use or when itâ€™s closed and exposed to sunlight. This eco-friendly feature would extend battery life, reduce dependency on traditional power sources, and promote sustainable energy use.",
    "**Augmented Reality (AR) Touchpad**: Create a touchpad that utilizes AR technology to project interactive controls and shortcuts above its surface. Users could engage with virtual elements for enhanced productivity, such as manipulating 3D models in design software or navigating through complex spreadsheets with gestures, adding a layer of interactivity to traditional computing.",
    "**Modular Design for Easy Upgrades**: Develop a laptop with a modular design that allows users to easily swap out components like RAM, storage, or even the CPU. This would empower users to upgrade their devices as technology evolves, reducing electronic waste and prolonging the lifespan of the laptop.",
    "**Biometric Security Features**: Introduce advanced biometric security options beyond fingerprint scanning, such as facial recognition combined with voice recognition. This dual-layer authentication would ensure that only authorized users can access the laptop, enhancing security for sensitive information while providing a seamless user experience.",
    "**Smart Heat Management System**: Implement a smart cooling system that uses AI to monitor the laptop's temperature and adjust fan speed and airflow accordingly. This system could predict high-performance tasks and proactively manage heat, ensuring optimal performance while minimizing noise and extending the lifespan of internal components."
