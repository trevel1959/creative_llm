    "Window Ventilation: One of the most straightforward ways to regulate indoor temperature would be to use natural ventilation through windows. By opening windows on opposite sides of the room, warm air can escape and be replaced with cooler air from outside. This method is particularly effective in well-insulated homes with large windows that can allow for efficient airflow.",
    "Thermal Mass Design: Incorporating thermal mass materials like concrete, brick, or stone into your home's design can help regulate temperature. These materials absorb and release heat slowly, providing a consistent temperature. For example, a concrete slab floor can absorb heat during the day and release it at night, keeping the room cooler.",
    "Evaporative Cooling: Evaporative cooling is a natural and energy-efficient method of cooling. By using a fan to blow air through a wet cloth or sponge, warm air can be cooled through evaporation. This method is particularly effective in dry climates where the air is already hot and humidity is low.",
    "Passive Solar Design: Designing a home with passive solar principles in mind can help regulate temperature. By strategically placing windows and insulation, a home can take advantage of natural sunlight and heat during the winter months, while blocking it during the summer. This can help maintain a consistent temperature throughout the year.",
    "Phase Change Materials: Phase change materials (PCMs) are substances that can absorb and release heat as they change phase from solid to liquid. These materials can be integrated into building design to regulate temperature. For example, PCMs can be used in walls, floors, or ceilings to absorb heat during the day and release it at night, keeping the room cooler."
