    "**Eco-Friendly Off-Grid Village**: Design a sustainable village that harnesses renewable energy sources like solar, wind, and hydro power. Implement a smart grid system that optimizes energy distribution, reducing waste and increasing efficiency. Incorporate energy-efficient buildings made from locally sourced, sustainable materials, and promote a community-driven approach to energy conservation.",
    "**Bioluminescent Lighting**: Develop a technology that harnesses bioluminescent organisms, such as glowing mushrooms or bacteria, to create sustainable lighting solutions. These organisms can be integrated into various products, like streetlights, lanterns, or even clothing, providing a unique and environmentally friendly lighting option.",
    "**Energy-Harvesting Textiles**: Design and develop textiles that can harness and convert environmental energy, such as kinetic energy from walking or solar energy from sunlight, into electricity. These textiles can be integrated into clothing, upholstery, or other materials, providing a wearable and ubiquitous energy source.",
    "**Smart Agriculture**: Create a system that uses AI-powered sensors and drones to monitor and optimize crop growth, reducing the need for manual labor and minimizing energy consumption. This system can also predict and prevent crop diseases, reducing the need for pesticides and other chemicals.",
    "**Underwater Energy Harvesting**: Develop a system that harnesses the kinetic energy generated by ocean currents and waves to produce electricity. This can be achieved through the use of underwater turbines or piezoelectric materials that convert mechanical energy into electrical energy. This technology can provide a reliable and renewable source of energy for coastal communities and marine ecosystems."
