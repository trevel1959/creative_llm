    "Uncovering Hidden Crimes: With the ability to make anyone tell the truth, I would use it to uncover hidden crimes and bring criminals to justice. I would start by focusing on high-profile cases that have gone unsolved for years, such as unexplained disappearances or suspicious deaths. By using my power on key witnesses and suspects, I could uncover the truth behind these crimes and help bring the perpetrators to justice.",
    "Promoting Social Change: I would use my power to promote social change by forcing politicians, corporate leaders, and other influential individuals to tell the truth about their actions and motivations. By exposing corruption and lies, I could help create a more transparent and just society. For example, I could force a corrupt politician to admit to embezzlement, or a CEO to admit to exploiting their workers.",
    "Resolving Conflicts: With my power, I could help resolve conflicts by forcing both sides to tell the truth about their grievances and demands. By understanding the root causes of the conflict, I could help facilitate a peaceful resolution. For instance, I could force a warring nation to admit to their territorial claims, or a couple to admit to their marital problems.",
    "Improving Mental Health: I would use my power to help individuals struggling with mental health issues by forcing them to confront their deepest fears and anxieties. By understanding the underlying causes of their problems, I could help them find the courage to seek help and receive the treatment they need. For example, I could force a person with a history of trauma to admit their fears and insecurities, or a person struggling with addiction to admit their cravings and triggers.",
    "Educating the Public: Finally, I would use my power to educate the public on important issues that are often ignored or hidden from view. By forcing key figures and institutions to tell the truth, I could help raise awareness about topics such as climate change, inequality, and social injustice. For example, I could force a denialist to admit the scientific evidence for climate change, or a corrupt university to admit their role in perpetuating inequality."
