    "**Storytelling Show**: Create a storytelling show where parrots are trained to tell stories using a combination of human narration and pre-recorded phrases. The parrot who couldn't repeat could be a star in this show, using its unique vocabulary and style to create a one-of-a-kind performance. ",
    "**Interactive Storytelling App**: Develop an interactive storytelling app that allows users to choose their own adventure while listening to a parrot narrate the story. The app can feature different parrots, each with their own style and vocabulary, providing a personalized experience.",
    "**Parrot Language Research Project**: Undertake a scientific project focusing on parrot communication and language development. The parrot who couldn't repeat might be an interesting subject due to its inability to repeat sounds, which could provide valuable insights into the cognitive processes behind vocal learning in parrots.",
    "**Art Installation**: Create an art installation that showcases the unique communication skills of the parrot who couldn't repeat. This could include visual representations of the parrot's vocabulary, sound recordings of its attempts to mimic sounds, and perhaps even interactive elements where visitors can contribute to the parrot's \"speech\" through a keyboard or touch screen.",
    "**Parrot-Themed Restaurant**: Open a restaurant where the theme is centered around parrots, with menu items named after famous parrots or featuring parrot-themed artwork. A highlight could be having a parrot (or multiple) serve as the mascot, interacting with customers in a playful manner, and perhaps attempting to communicate through a modified version of their unique vocabulary."
