    "Human-Animal Interactions: With larger animals, there would be an increased risk of human-animal conflicts. For example, larger predators could pose a threat to human life, and larger herbivores could cause more damage to crops and property.",
    "Ecosystem Balance: The growth of animals to twice their size could disrupt the delicate balance of ecosystems. Predators and prey populations could become unbalanced, leading to a decline in biodiversity.",
    "Transportation Challenges: Larger animals would require larger vehicles and infrastructure to transport them, which could be costly and logistically challenging.",
    "Economic Impact: The growth of animals to twice their size could have both positive and negative economic impacts. On one hand, larger animals could be more valuable for agriculture and tourism, but on the other hand, the increased costs of transportation and infrastructure could offset these benefits.",
    "Medical Research: The growth of animals to twice their size could provide valuable insights into human health and disease. For example, studying the effects of growth hormones on large animals could lead to new treatments for human conditions."
