This could be particularly engaging for artists and students, providing an emotional connection to their work.",
    "**Pencil with Built-in LED Light**: For those who often find themselves writing in low-light conditions, a pencil equipped with a small LED light could illuminate the writing surface.

The light could be adjustable, allowing users to choose between different brightness levels, making it perfect for late-night study sessions or outdoor sketching.",
    "**Pencil with Integrated Voice Recorder**: This innovative pencil would include a tiny voice recorder that allows users to record their thoughts or lectures while they write.
