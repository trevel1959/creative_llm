    "**Smart Pencil**: Integrate technology into the pencil, such as a built-in Bluetooth transmitter that can pair with a smartphone or tablet. This would allow the user to digitize their handwritten notes directly into a digital notebook or a note-taking app.",
    "**Self-Sharpening Pencil**: Develop a mechanism that allows the pencil to sharpen itself when it's not in use. This could be achieved through a spring-loaded mechanism that automatically sharpens the pencil's tip when it's placed back into the pencil sharpener.",
    "**Eco-Friendly Pencil**: Create a pencil made from sustainable materials, such as recycled wood and non-toxic inks. This would appeal to environmentally conscious consumers and reduce the environmental impact of pencil production.",
    "**Pencil with a built-in eraser**: Combine the pencil and eraser into a single, streamlined tool. This would save space in a pencil case and make it more convenient for the user to erase their mistakes without needing a separate eraser.",
    "**Multi-Functional Pencil**: Incorporate additional tools into the pencil, such as a small flashlight, a mini stylus for digital devices, or a small compass for navigation. This would make the pencil a more versatile tool for a variety of tasks."
