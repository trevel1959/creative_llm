    "**Eco-Friendly Stapler with Biodegradable Staples**: Develop a stapler that uses biodegradable staples made from sustainable materials. This stapler would appeal to environmentally conscious consumers. The design could include a compartment for storing the biodegradable staples, and it could feature a recycling bin for collecting used staples, promoting a greener office environment.",
    "**Multi-Function Stapler**: Create a stapler that combines multiple office functions in one device. This could include a built-in hole punch, paper trimmer, and even a small paper shredder. This all-in-one device would save space on desks and reduce the need for multiple tools, making it ideal for small offices or home use.",
    "**Adjustable Stapling Pressure**: Design a stapler with an adjustable pressure setting, allowing users to customize the stapling force depending on the thickness of the documents. This feature would prevent damage to delicate papers while ensuring secure binding for thicker stacks. A simple dial or slider could control the pressure, making it user-friendly.",
    "**Magnetic Stapler**: Introduce a stapler with a magnetic base that can adhere to metal surfaces, such as filing cabinets or whiteboards. This would make it easily accessible in shared workspaces, allowing users to grab it quickly without searching through drawers. The magnetic feature could also include a detachable section that can hold spare staples or paper clips.",
    "**Self-Loading Stapler**: Imagine a stapler that automatically loads staples as needed. Using a small motorized mechanism, the stapler could detect when staples are running low and automatically pull a new staple into position. This would eliminate the frustration of manual loading and make the stapling process more efficient, especially in high-volume settings."
