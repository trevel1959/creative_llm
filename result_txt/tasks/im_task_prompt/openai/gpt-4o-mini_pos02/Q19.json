    "**Integrated Augmented Reality (AR)**: Develop glasses that incorporate AR technology to provide users with real-time information overlays. For instance, when looking at a building, the glasses could display historical facts, nearby restaurants, or even navigation directions. This would enhance the userâ€™s experience and provide useful information without the need for a smartphone.",
    "**Health Monitoring Features**: Create glasses equipped with health sensors that monitor vital signs such as heart rate, blood oxygen levels, and even stress levels through subtle skin contact. The data could be synced to a mobile app, providing users with insights about their health and wellness throughout the day.",
    "**Self-Cleaning Lenses**: Innovate lenses with a self-cleaning coating that utilizes nanotechnology to repel dust, water, and smudges. This would ensure that the glasses remain clear and functional without the need for constant wiping, enhancing the user experience, especially for those in active or outdoor environments.",
    "**Customizable Frame Designs**: Introduce a modular frame system that allows users to customize their glasses by swapping out parts. This could include different colors, patterns, or materials for the frame, as well as interchangeable temple arms and nose pads. This personalization would cater to individual style preferences and promote sustainability by reducing waste.",
    "**Bluetooth Connectivity and Audio Integration**: Design glasses that feature built-in bone conduction speakers and Bluetooth connectivity. This would allow users to listen to music, take calls, or receive navigation prompts without the need for earbuds. The audio would be transmitted through vibrations in the frame, keeping the ears free and maintaining awareness of the surroundings."
