    "Lily woke up to a peculiar silence on her birthday. She tiptoed downstairs, only to find her living room filled with balloons and streamersâ€”yet no one was there. Confused, she wandered through the decorations, her heart sinking. Suddenly, a gust of wind rustled the balloons, and a soft giggle echoed. \"Happy birthday, Lily!\" whispered her best friend, Mia, who had organized an invisible party. Friends had sent their laughter and wishes through enchanted whispers, making the day special despite their absence. As Lily closed her eyes, she felt their presence, realizing that love transcends even the invisible, bringing joy to her heart.",
