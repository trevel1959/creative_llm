    "**Funding and Financial Sustainability**: Securing adequate funding for the establishment and ongoing maintenance of the park can be a significant hurdle. Potential problems include reliance on inconsistent government grants, the challenge of attracting private investors, and the difficulty of generating revenue through eco-tourism or educational programs. Without a solid financial plan, the park may struggle to maintain its facilities, staff, and conservation efforts, leading to a decline in its effectiveness and appeal.",
    "**Community Engagement and Support**: Engaging local communities is essential for the success of a conservation park. However, potential issues may arise if community members feel excluded from the planning process or if they perceive the park as a threat to their livelihoods (e.g., restrictions on land use). Resistance from local residents can lead to conflicts and undermine conservation efforts. It’s important to create a participatory approach, ensuring that community needs and values are integrated into the park’s mission and operations.",
    "**Legal and Regulatory Challenges**: Establishing a nature conservation park often involves navigating complex legal and regulatory frameworks. Potential problems include obtaining necessary permits, dealing with land ownership disputes, and adhering to environmental laws. If these legal issues are not addressed adequately, they can delay the establishment of the park or lead to future litigation, ultimately jeopardizing conservation goals.",
    "**Infrastructure Development and Environmental Impact**: Developing the necessary infrastructure (e.g., visitor centers, trails, restrooms) can pose environmental challenges. The construction process may disturb local ecosystems, harm wildlife habitats, and contribute to pollution. Careful planning is required to minimize the environmental footprint of infrastructure while providing necessary amenities for visitors. Failure to do so could lead to significant backlash from conservationists and the public.",
    "**Climate Change Resilience**: As climate change continues to impact ecosystems globally, establishing a conservation park requires a forward-thinking approach to resilience. Potential problems include selecting areas that may become less viable for certain species due to shifting climate patterns or extreme weather events. A thorough understanding of climate science and adaptive management strategies is essential to ensure that the park can sustain its biodiversity in the face of changing conditions."
