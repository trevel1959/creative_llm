    "36 hours. I think 36 hours would be a good length of time for a day because it would give people more time to get things done. It would allow for an extra 12 hours of daytime each day, which would be very beneficial for those who have busy schedules or who have difficulty getting all their work done in a single day. Additionally, 36 hours would be a more reasonable length of time for a day than 24 hours, which can sometimes feel like a rushed and stressful time.",
    "48 hours. I think 48 hours would be a good length of time for a day because it would give people twice as much time to get things done. This would be beneficial for those who have a lot of tasks to complete in a single day or who have difficulty getting everything done in a 24-hour period. This would also allow for 24-hour day and night each day, which would be very convenient for businesses and activities that need to be open for extended periods.",
    "2 months. I think 2 months would be a good length of time for a day because it would give people plenty of time to get things done. This would be beneficial for those who have a lot of tasks to complete or who have difficulty getting everything done in a single day. This would also allow for more flexibility and time to plan, which would be very convenient for businesses and activities that need to be open for extended periods.",
    "1 year. I think 1 year would be a good length of time for a day because it would give people plenty of time to get things done. This would be beneficial for those who have a lot of tasks to complete or who have difficulty getting everything done in a single day. This would also allow for more flexibility and time to plan, which would be very convenient for businesses and activities that need to be open for extended periods.",
    "36 hours: A longer day would give people more time to get their daily tasks done, reducing stress and allowing for more productivity. It could also allow for a longer night for those who work long hours or have other nighttime activities."
