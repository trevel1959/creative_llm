    "Bug Hotels: Build massive, multi-story hotels specifically designed to accommodate and house insects. These hotels could be made of natural materials like bamboo, straw, or wood, and would provide a safe and comfortable living space for the insects.",
    "Insect Farms: Establish large-scale insect farms where insects could be raised and harvested for food. This would provide a sustainable source of protein for humans and reduce the need for pesticides and other harmful chemicals.",
    "Insect-Repelling Plantations: Plant vast fields of insect-repelling plants like lavender, basil, or mint. These plants could be used to create natural barriers to keep insects away from homes and crops, while also providing a source of food and shelter for beneficial insects.",
    "Robot Insect Swarms: Develop and deploy swarms of small, autonomous robots that could be programmed to hunt and eliminate pest insects. These robots could be powered by solar energy and could be designed to navigate and target specific insect species.",
    "Insect-Friendly Architecture: Design buildings and homes that incorporate features that are beneficial to insects, such as bee hotels, bug gardens, and green roofs. These features would provide a safe and welcoming environment for insects, while also reducing the need for pesticides and other harmful chemicals."
