    "Pedal-Powered Public Transit: Create a network of pedal-powered buses and trains that can transport large groups of people. These vehicles would be powered by individuals pedaling stationary bicycles connected to the vehicle's wheels, providing a sustainable and eco-friendly mode of transportation.",
    "Personal Flying Devices: Develop personal flying devices that can be worn on the body, similar to a backpack or a helmet. These devices would use electrical propulsion and be powered by rechargeable batteries, allowing individuals to soar through the air without the need for a car.",
    "Hoverboard Infrastructure: Create a network of hoverboard lanes and paths that allow individuals to glide through cities without touching the ground. These lanes would be powered by magnetic fields or air pressure, providing a smooth and efficient mode of transportation.",
    "Magnetic Levitation Transportation: Develop a system of magnetic levitation trains that can transport people and goods at high speeds without touching the ground. These trains would use magnetic fields to levitate the train above the track, reducing friction and increasing speed, making transportation faster and more efficient.",
    "Bio-Inspired Transportation: Create transportation systems inspired by nature, such as a \"flying fish\" vehicle that can launch from water or a \"gecko\" vehicle that can climb walls and ceilings. These vehicles would use advanced materials and technologies to mimic the movements of animals, providing a unique and sustainable mode of transportation."
