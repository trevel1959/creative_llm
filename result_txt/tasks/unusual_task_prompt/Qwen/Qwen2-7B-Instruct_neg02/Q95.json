    "**DIY Air Filter**: Use coffee filters to create an effective air filter for your home or office. Coffee filters are porous and can absorb impurities in the air. Cut them into strips and attach them to a frame or cardboard box. The air can pass through the coffee filters while dust, pollen, and other particles are trapped.",
    "**Portable Water Filtration System**: Create a portable water filtration system using coffee filters. By stacking multiple coffee filters together, you can purify water on the go. This is especially useful when camping, hiking, or during natural disasters when access to clean water may be limited.",
    "**DIY Face Mask Filters**: In times of need for face masks, coffee filters can serve as a makeshift filter layer. Place a coffee filter between two layers of fabric (like cotton or silk) to create a reusable mask that can help reduce the spread of airborne particles.",
    "**Air Freshener Diffuser**: Transform used coffee filters into a DIY air freshener diffuser. Soak the coffee filters in essential oils, then hang them in areas where you want to diffuse a pleasant scent. As the filter dries, the scent will gradually release into the air.",
    "**Crafty Decorative Purposes**: Instead of throwing away coffee filters, repurpose them into unique decorative items. For example, you can cut them into various shapes and sizes and use them to make wall art, lampshades, or even a decorative mobile by attaching them to a string and hanging them from the ceiling. "
