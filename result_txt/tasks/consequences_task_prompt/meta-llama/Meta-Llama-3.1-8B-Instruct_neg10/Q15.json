    "**Eco-Tourism Boom**: With the depletion of oil, the world would be forced to shift towards sustainable energy sources. This would lead to a significant increase in eco-tourism, as people would flock to see the remnants of old oil infrastructure and the natural landscapes that have been preserved due to the lack of oil exploration. This boom would create new jobs, stimulate local economies, and promote environmental conservation.",
    "**Revival of Local Crafts**: The scarcity of oil would lead to a decrease in the production and transportation of goods, making local crafts and handmade products more desirable. People would turn to traditional craftsmanship, such as woodworking, pottery, and textiles, to create items that are both functional and aesthetically pleasing. This revival would not only preserve cultural heritage but also provide a sense of community and self-sufficiency.",
    "**Rise of Vertical Farming**: With the decline of oil-based transportation and agriculture, vertical farming would become a crucial component of food production. This method of growing crops in vertically stacked layers would increase crop yields, reduce water consumption, and minimize the need for pesticides and fertilizers. Vertical farming would become a key player in ensuring global food security and reducing the environmental impact of agriculture.",
    "**Shift to Alternative Transportation**: The world would be forced to adapt to alternative modes of transportation, such as electric and human-powered vehicles. This shift would lead to a decrease in air pollution, greenhouse gas emissions, and the overall carbon footprint. Cities would be redesigned to prioritize pedestrian-friendly and bike-friendly infrastructure, promoting a healthier and more sustainable lifestyle.",
    "**Resurgence of Community-Based Living**: The scarcity of oil would lead to a decrease in the availability of energy-intensive amenities, such as air conditioning and refrigeration. As a result, people would be forced to adapt to a more communal way of living, where neighbors and communities come together to share resources and support one another. This resurgence of community-based living would foster a sense of belonging, cooperation, and social cohesion.
