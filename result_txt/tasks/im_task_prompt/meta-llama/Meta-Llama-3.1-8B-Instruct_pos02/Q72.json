    "**Eco-Friendly Surfboard**: Design a surfboard made from recycled and biodegradable materials, such as recycled plastic, bamboo, or hemp. The board would be durable, lightweight, and easy to repair, reducing the need for new, resource-intensive surfboards. The eco-friendly design could also include features like built-in fins made from recycled materials or a removable fin system that reduces waste.",
    "**Smart Surfboard**: Develop a high-tech surfboard with integrated sensors and GPS tracking, allowing surfers to monitor their performance, track their route, and receive real-time feedback on their surfing skills. The board could also include features like a built-in camera for capturing surf footage, a heart rate monitor, or even a waterproof speaker system for listening to music while surfing.",
    "**Modular Surfboard**: Design a modular surfboard system that allows surfers to customize and upgrade their board as needed. The system could consist of interchangeable components, such as different nose and tail sections, fins, or even a removable deck pad. This would enable surfers to experiment with various designs and styles without having to purchase a new board.",
    "**Surfboard for People with Disabilities**: Create a specialized surfboard designed for individuals with physical disabilities, such as those with mobility or balance impairments. The board could feature a wider, more stable platform, adjustable foot straps, or even a joystick control system for easier maneuverability. This innovative design would make surfing more accessible and inclusive for people with disabilities.",
    "**Surfboard-Shaped Floating Island**: Envision a surfboard-shaped floating island that doubles as a sustainable, eco-friendly surf spot. The island could be designed with a built-in wave generator, creating a consistent and predictable wave pattern for surfers. The island could also feature a solar-powered energy system, a rainwater harvesting system, and a composting toilet, making it a self-sufficient and environmentally friendly surf destination."
