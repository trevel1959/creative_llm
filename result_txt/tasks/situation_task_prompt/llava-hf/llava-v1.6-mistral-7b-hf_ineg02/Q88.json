    "Submarine: If all roads became impassable, a submarine could be used to travel underwater. This would allow for travel across bodies of water and provide an alternative means of transportation.",
    "Magnetic Levitation: A magnetic levitation train or vehicle could be used to travel over long distances. This would allow for high-speed travel without the need for traditional tracks or infrastructure.",
    "Flying Car: If all roads became impassable, a flying car could be used to travel through the air. This would eliminate the need for roads and allow for travel over vast distances.",
    "Tunneling: If all roads became impassable, tunneling technology could be used to create underground tunnels for travel. This would allow for travel beneath the surface and bypass any obstacles on the surface.",
    "Hyperloop: A hyperloop system could be used to travel at high speeds through a vacuum tube. This would allow for rapid travel without the need for roads or other infrastructure."
