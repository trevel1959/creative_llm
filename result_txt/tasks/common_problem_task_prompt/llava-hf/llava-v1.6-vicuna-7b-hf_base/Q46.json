    "Limited space: In densely populated urban areas, finding space for new bus stops, train stations, or depots can be challenging. This may lead to conflicts with existing infrastructure, such as roads, buildings, and parks.",
    "Environmental concerns: The implementation of new, more sustainable transportation technologies may be hindered by concerns about their environmental impact, such as air pollution or noise pollution.",
    "Resistance from stakeholders: The overhaul of the public transportation system may require changes to existing routes, schedules, or services. This may lead to resistance from passengers, transit workers, or other stakeholders who may be affected by these changes.",
    "Integration with other modes of transportation: The overhaul of the public transportation system may need to be coordinated with other modes of transportation, such as trains, bicycles, or pedestrians. This may require significant planning and coordination to ensure seamless integration.",
    "Safety concerns: The implementation of new technologies or systems may introduce new safety risks, such as accidents involving autonomous vehicles or cybersecurity breaches."
