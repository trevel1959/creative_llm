    "Hydrogen Fuel Cells: One option to power vehicles without oil is to use hydrogen fuel cells. Hydrogen fuel cells generate electricity by reacting hydrogen with oxygen, producing only water and heat as byproducts. This technology is already being tested in some vehicles, such as buses and cars, and has the potential to be scaled up for widespread use.",
    "Solar Power: Another option is to use solar power to generate electricity for vehicles. Solar panels could be installed on roads or in parking lots, providing a renewable source of energy for charging electric vehicles. This would not only reduce our reliance on oil but also help to reduce greenhouse gas emissions.",
    "Nuclear Power: Nuclear power could also be used to generate electricity for vehicles. Advanced nuclear reactors are being developed that are safer and more efficient than traditional nuclear power plants, and could provide a reliable source of energy for transportation.",
    "Advanced Batteries: Advances in battery technology could also help to power vehicles without oil. New battery designs, such as solid-state batteries, could provide more energy density and longer lifetimes, making electric vehicles more practical for long-distance travel."
