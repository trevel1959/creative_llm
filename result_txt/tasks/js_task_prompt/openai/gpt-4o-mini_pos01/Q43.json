    "**Safety and Security Assessments**: This power could be utilized to enhance safety and security in public and private spaces. By seeing through walls, I could identify potential hazards such as structural weaknesses, fire risks, or unauthorized access points. I could work with building inspectors and security teams to conduct thorough assessments, ensuring that buildings are safe for occupancy and that security measures are effective. This could also extend to emergency response scenarios, allowing first responders to locate victims or assess situations before entering dangerous environments.",
    "**Educational Insights**: I would use this ability to enhance educational experiences in fields such as archaeology and anthropology. By seeing through layers of earth and structures, I could reveal hidden artifacts or historical layers without excavation. This would lead to a more profound understanding of historical contexts and cultures, allowing students and researchers to study ancient civilizations in real-time. Additionally, this could foster a new form of interactive learning, where students could visualize historical events as they happened.",
    "**Home Maintenance and Repairs**: Homeowners often face unexpected repair costs due to hidden issues like mold, pests, or structural damage. With the power to see through walls, I could offer a service that provides detailed inspections of homes, identifying problems before they escalate. This proactive approach would save homeowners money and stress, as I could recommend targeted repairs and maintenance strategies. Furthermore, this service could be extended to real estate agents, helping buyers make informed decisions before purchasing a property.",
    "**Art and Creativity**: I would explore the intersection of art and architecture by creating immersive installations that play with the concept of visibility. By incorporating transparent materials and visual projections, I could design spaces that invite people to experience the unseen aspects of architecture and design. These installations could serve as public art pieces or gallery exhibits, challenging perceptions of space and structure while engaging audiences in a dialogue about what lies beneath the surface.",
    "**Urban Exploration and Preservation**: With the ability to see through walls, I could participate in urban exploration to document and preserve forgotten or abandoned spaces. This could involve mapping out hidden areas of historical significance, allowing preservationists to assess and restore these sites. By sharing these discoveries through multimedia storytelling, I could raise awareness about the importance of preserving cultural heritage and inspire others to appreciate the stories that lie within neglected structures."
