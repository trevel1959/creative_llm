    "Budget: Planning a birthday party for a 5-year-old can quickly become expensive with party decorations, invitations, food and drinks, and entertainment. It’s important to stick to a budget and consider ways to save money, such as making decorations or inviting only close friends and family members.",
    "Catering: Feeding a large group of children can be a challenge, particularly for 5-year-olds with picky tastes and dietary restrictions. Planning and preparing food that accommodates everyone may cause stress and require extra effort.",
    "Guest management: Ensuring that all invited guests are able to attend and managing any last-minute cancellations can be a challenge. It’s important to have a backup plan in place, such as allowing for additional guests or rescheduling in case of unforeseen circumstances.",
    "Entertainment: 5-year-olds have short attention spans, so it’s important to plan entertainment that is engaging and keeps the children interested for the duration of the party. Activities such as games, crafts, and storytelling sessions are popular choices.",
    "Logistics: It’s important to consider logistics, such as transportation, parking, and accessibility for all guests, especially if the party location is not easily accessible. Ensuring that there is enough seating and space for all guests is also important."
