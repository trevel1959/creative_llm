    "Green Infrastructure: I would use my ability to grow trees and plants in a way that they could act as natural barriers to reduce the impact of flooding, erosion, and heat island effects in cities. Trees and plants can absorb excess water and release it slowly, preventing rapid runoff and reducing the strain on stormwater systems.",
    "Food Production: I would use my ability to grow food in indoor spaces, such as offices or schools, providing fresh produce to employees and students. This would not only improve their health but also contribute to a more sustainable and resilient food system.",
    "Eco-Tourism: I would use my ability to create unique and sustainable experiences for tourists. For example, I could grow a series of hanging gardens that could serve as a canopy for a walkway, allowing visitors to explore the natural beauty of the area while minimizing their impact on the environment.",
    "Biodiversity Preservation: I would use my ability to grow plants that could act as natural barriers to protect endangered species from habitat loss, invasive species, and climate change. For example, I could create a network of floating gardens to help protect mangrove forests from rising sea levels.",
    "Mental Health Benefits: I would use my ability to grow plants that could act as natural stress-relievers and mood enhancers. For example, I could grow a series of lavender plants in public spaces, which are known to have a calming effect on the mind."
