    "**Building a Sustainable Shelter**: The first priority for survival is finding shelter from harsh elements. Using natural resources such as fallen trees, branches, leaves, and vines, you can create a sturdy shelter. Consider using a lean-to structure that can be easily built by leaning a large branch against a tree and covering it with leaves or moss to keep off rain and insects.",
    "**Creating a Water Filtration System**: Water is essential for survival, but the water sources found on an island may not always be safe to drink. You can build a simple water filtration system using materials like sand, rocks, and charcoal. Dig a hole, layer the bottom with gravel, then add sand, charcoal, and more sand before filling the hole with water. The layers will help filter out impurities.",
    "**Growing Your Own Food**: With a little ingenuity, you can grow your own food on a deserted island. Look for areas rich in soil and start planting seeds. Coconut palms are a good choice as they provide both food (coconut meat) and water (coconut water). Additionally, you can grow root vegetables like yams or sweet potatoes which have a high energy content.",
    "**Making Tools and Weapons**: Tools and weapons are crucial for survival. You can make crude tools like spears, fishing nets, and knives using materials found on the island. For example, sharpened sticks or stones can serve as knives. Nets can be made from vines or leaves, and spears can be used for hunting or protection.",
    "**Signal Devices**: To attract rescue, you need to signal others. Building a large, visible fire or creating a smoke signal can draw attention. Alternatively, you can create a distress beacon using reflective surfaces like mirrors or aluminum cans. By reflecting sunlight or setting them up at strategic locations, these devices can increase the chances of being spotted from the air or sea. "
