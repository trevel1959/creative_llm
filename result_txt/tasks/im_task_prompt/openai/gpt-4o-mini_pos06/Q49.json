    "**Eco-Friendly Reusable Brush Heads**: Develop a line of reusable brush heads made from biodegradable materials that can be easily cleaned and sterilized. This would reduce plastic waste associated with traditional disposable brush heads. Users could simply replace the bristles, which would attach magnetically to a durable handle, promoting sustainability while maintaining hygiene.",
    "**Integrated UV Sanitizer**: Incorporate a UV-C light sanitizing feature within the toothbrush handle that activates after use. This technology would kill 99.9% of bacteria and viruses on the brush head, ensuring a cleaner brushing experience. The UV light could be powered by the toothbrush's battery and activated automatically when the brush is placed back in its charging dock.",
    "**Adaptive Bristle Technology**: Design a toothbrush with adaptive bristle technology that adjusts the firmness and angle of the bristles based on the user's brushing pressure. This feature would provide a gentle cleaning experience for sensitive gums while ensuring effective plaque removal when more pressure is applied. The bristles could change color to indicate when they need replacement, ensuring optimal performance.",
    "**Multi-Functional Toothbrush**: Create a toothbrush that includes additional dental care features, such as a tongue scraper, floss dispenser, and a built-in mouthwash reservoir. This all-in-one device would simplify the oral care routine, making it more convenient for users to maintain their dental hygiene with fewer products.",
    "**Gamified Brushing Experience**: Develop an interactive app that pairs with the toothbrush to gamify the brushing experience, especially for children. The app could include fun challenges, rewards, and educational content about oral health. It could track brushing time and technique, rewarding kids with points or badges for consistent and effective brushing, encouraging lifelong healthy habits."
