    "**Inflatable Headrest Band**: A wearable inflatable headrest band could be designed to be worn around the head while sleeping. This band would feature small, adjustable air chambers that can be inflated or deflated to create a custom headrest shape. The user could easily control the firmness and height through a small pump or a built-in valve. The headrest band would also have soft padding on the inner side to prevent discomfort and could be made from hypoallergenic materials for sensitive skin.",
    "**Nature’s Nest**: This idea revolves around creating a natural sleeping environment. Users could gather soft materials like leaves, moss, or grass to create a “nest” for their head. The nest would be shaped and formed to cradle the head while sleeping, utilizing the natural contours of the materials to provide comfort. This method would not only be eco-friendly but also encourage a deeper connection with nature, allowing for a more restful sleep under the stars or in a garden setting.",
    "**Memory Foam Armrest**: A unique armrest that attaches to the side of the bed could be designed with a memory foam surface that conforms to the shape of your head. When lying on your side, you could rest your head on this adjustable armrest, which could be positioned at various heights. The armrest would also have a cooling gel layer to prevent overheating during the night. This innovative solution would provide support while allowing freedom of movement and flexibility in sleeping positions.",
    "**Hammock Headrest**: Inspired by the comfort of a hammock, this headrest would be a small, suspended fabric structure that hangs from the bed frame or ceiling. The design would allow the head to gently sink into the fabric while being supported from below, mimicking the feeling of being cradled. The hammock headrest could be made from soft, breathable materials and would allow for air circulation, preventing overheating while providing a unique and relaxing sleep experience.",
    "**Weighted Blanket Pillow**: A small, weighted blanket designed specifically for head support could be created. This “pillow” would be filled with tiny beads or pellets to provide gentle pressure, helping to relax the muscles in the neck and head. The design would be flat and wide enough to distribute weight evenly, ensuring comfort without the bulk of a traditional pillow. Users could adjust the amount of filling to find their perfect level of support and comfort."
