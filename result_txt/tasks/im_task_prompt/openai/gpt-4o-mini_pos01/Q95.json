    "**Foldable and Modular Design**: Create a laundry basket that can fold flat for easy storage when not in use. Additionally, introduce modular sections that can be detached and used as smaller baskets for sorting clothes (e.g., lights, darks, delicates). This would make it easier to transport laundry and keep things organized.",
    "**Odor Neutralizing Technology**: Integrate a compartment that contains odor-neutralizing materials, such as activated charcoal or baking soda. This would help eliminate any unpleasant smells from dirty laundry, making it more pleasant to store clothes before washing.",
    "**Self-Cleaning Fabric**: Develop a laundry basket made from a special fabric that has self-cleaning properties, utilizing nanotechnology to break down dirt and stains. This would minimize the need for washing the basket itself and maintain a fresher environment for laundry.",
    "**Built-in Sorting Mechanism**: Design a laundry basket with internal dividers that can be adjusted based on the userâ€™s sorting preferences. Users can have separate compartments for different types of laundry (e.g., colors, whites, delicates) that can be easily accessed without the need to dig through the basket.",
    "**Laundry Basket with a Hamper Lid**: Create a laundry basket that features a lid that can double as a hamper. The lid could be designed to open easily with one hand, allowing users to toss in clothes without having to lift the entire basket. This would make it more convenient for quick laundry sessions."
