    "**Staff Training and Retention**: The complexity of animal care requires well-trained staff. A potential issue is high turnover rates, which can lead to inconsistent care and safety risks. To combat this, the zoo could develop a comprehensive training program that includes mentorship opportunities, continuous education on animal behavior, and wellness initiatives for staff. This would not only improve care standards but also enhance job satisfaction and retention.",
    "**Public Safety and Interaction**: Ensuring the safety of visitors while providing engaging experiences is crucial. Problems can arise if animals exhibit unpredictable behavior, or if visitors attempt to interact with them inappropriately. To mitigate this risk, the zoo could introduce more structured interaction experiences, such as supervised feeding sessions or educational talks, where visitors can learn how to interact safely with certain species under the guidance of trained staff.",
    "**Sustainability and Environmental Impact**: Zoos can face scrutiny regarding their environmental impact, particularly in terms of habitat preservation and resource use. Problems may arise from excessive waste, energy consumption, or habitat destruction. The zoo could implement sustainable practices, such as using renewable energy sources, establishing a recycling program, and engaging in habitat restoration projects, to demonstrate a commitment to environmental stewardship.",
    "**Funding and Financial Viability**: Many zoos operate on tight budgets, leading to potential problems in funding for animal care, facility maintenance, and educational programs. To address this, the zoo could diversify its revenue streams by hosting special events, developing membership programs, and creating partnerships with local businesses for sponsorships. Additionally, they could engage in community outreach to increase public support and awareness about the zooâ€™s mission.",
    "**Animal Breeding and Conservation Programs**: A zoo's role in conservation can be hindered by challenges in breeding programs, such as genetic diversity issues or unsuccessful breeding attempts. This could lead to a lack of viable populations for reintroduction efforts. The zoo could collaborate with other institutions to share genetic material and knowledge, as well as participate in global breeding programs to enhance the genetic health of endangered species."
