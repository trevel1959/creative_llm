The screen could also provide tips on how to store different types of bread and suggest optimal usage timelines, making it a multifunctional kitchen assistant.",
    "**Customizable Storage Compartments**: Design the bread box with adjustable internal compartments that can be rearranged based on the type and quantity of bread being stored. This feature would allow users to separate different types of bread (like baguettes, rolls, and loaves) while maximizing space and minimizing squishing or stale exposure.",
    "**Built-in Bread Slicer**: Create a bread box with a built-in, retractable slicer that allows users to easily slice their bread without needing an additional tool. The slicer could feature adjustable thickness settings and a safety mechanism to ensure users can slice their bread safely and conveniently, making it a one-stop solution for bread storage and preparation.",
    "**Eco-Friendly Design**: Construct the bread box using sustainable materials, such as bamboo or recycled plastics, to appeal to environmentally conscious consumers. Additionally, incorporate a compost bin feature at the bottom for bread scraps or stale pieces, encouraging users to dispose of waste responsibly while keeping their kitchen tidy.",
    "**Odor Neutralizing Technology**: Integrate an odor-neutralizing system within the bread box, utilizing activated charcoal or a similar material to absorb unwanted smells. This would be particularly beneficial in kitchens where various foods are stored nearby, ensuring that the bread retains its original aroma and flavor without being affected by other ingredients."
