    "Floating Wind Turbine Power Plant: Create a power plant that utilizes wind turbines installed on floating platforms in the ocean or large lakes. This innovative approach can harness the consistent and abundant wind energy in these areas, while minimizing visual impact on coastal communities and reducing the risk of bird strikes. The platforms can be designed to adjust their position to optimize energy production based on wind patterns.",
    "Solar-Powered Desalination Plant: Design a power plant that utilizes solar panels to generate electricity, which is then used to power a desalination process that converts seawater into freshwater. This approach can provide a reliable source of clean water for communities located near the coast, while also providing a sustainable source of energy. The desalination process can be powered by a combination of solar and wind energy to ensure a consistent supply of freshwater.",
    "Biomass-Fueled Power Plant: Develop a power plant that utilizes biomass feedstocks such as agricultural waste, forestry waste, or even algae to generate electricity. This approach can reduce greenhouse gas emissions and provide a sustainable source of energy, as the biomass can be sourced locally and converted into energy on-site. The power plant can also be designed to produce heat and power for nearby industrial or residential areas, maximizing the use of the biomass feedstock.",
    "Hydrokinetic Power Plant: Create a power plant that harnesses the energy of moving water in rivers, tidal currents, or ocean currents. This innovative approach can generate electricity without the need for large dams or land-based infrastructure, minimizing environmental impact. The power plant can be designed to be modular and scalable, allowing for easy deployment in different locations and water conditions.",
    "Geothermal-Powered Water Heating System: Design a power plant that utilizes geothermal energy to heat water for residential or industrial use. This approach can provide a sustainable and efficient source of hot water, while also generating electricity through the use of a heat exchanger. The power plant can be designed to be scalable and modular, allowing for easy deployment in different locations and applications. Additionally, the geothermal energy can be used to power other applications such as heating and cooling systems,"
