    "Integrated Lighting: Another way to improve a bicycle helmet is to integrate lighting into its design. This could include LED lights that illuminate the road ahead, or reflective strips that make the rider more visible to other vehicles. This would increase the safety of the rider, especially during nighttime or low-light conditions.",
    "Improved Ventilation: A bicycle helmet can also be improved by enhancing its ventilation. This can be achieved by adding more vents to the helmet, or by using breathable materials such as mesh. This would allow for better airflow, keeping the rider cooler and more comfortable during long rides.",
    "Smart Technology Integration: The helmet can also be made \"smart\" by integrating various technologies such as GPS, Bluetooth, and even virtual reality. This would allow the rider to access various features while wearing the helmet, such as music playback, navigation, or even virtual training sessions.",
    "Customizable Design: A bicycle helmet can be improved by making it customizable. This could include different shell sizes, or different padding options to fit different head sizes and shapes. This would make the helmet more comfortable and effective for a wider range of riders.",
    "Energy Storage Integration: Another way to improve a bicycle helmet is to integrate energy storage technology. This could include a small battery pack that can be charged using a USB port, allowing the rider to use the energy to power various devices such as lights or a phone."
