    "DIY Dental Kit: Create a comprehensive DIY dental kit that includes a variety of tools and supplies for basic oral hygiene. This kit could include a toothbrush, toothpaste, floss, dental picks, and mouthwash. Include instructions on how to properly use each item and how to identify and treat common dental issues.",
    "Community Dental Co-ops: Establish community-based dental co-ops where individuals can share resources and expertise to provide affordable dental care. These co-ops could include a rotating schedule of volunteer dentists, dental hygienists, and other professionals who provide their services for free or at a reduced cost. Additionally, the co-ops could offer educational workshops and resources on proper oral hygiene practices.",
    "Mobile Dental Clinics: Develop mobile dental clinics that travel to underserved communities, providing on-site dental care to those who may not have access to regular dental care. These clinics could be staffed by volunteer dentists and hygienists and could offer a range of services, including cleanings, fillings, extractions, and dental education.",
    "3D Printed Dental Prosthetics: Utilize 3D printing technology to create custom dental prosthetics, such as crowns, bridges, and dentures. These prosthetics could be designed and printed in a matter of hours, providing a more efficient and cost-effective alternative to traditional dental implants. Additionally, the 3D printed prosthetics could be designed to be more comfortable and durable than traditional dental prosthetics.",
    "AI-Powered Dental Assistants: Develop an AI-powered dental assistant that can help patients navigate the dental care system, provide personalized recommendations for oral health, and even assist dentists during procedures. This AI-powered assistant could use machine learning algorithms to analyze a patient's medical history and oral health data to provide more accurate and effective treatment recommendations. Additionally, the AI-powered assistant could help dentists and hygienists by taking X-rays, identifying potential issues, and providing real-time feedback during procedures."
