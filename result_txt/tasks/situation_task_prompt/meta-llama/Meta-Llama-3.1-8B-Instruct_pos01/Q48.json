    "**Scent-based alarm**: Develop a device that releases a specific scent at a predetermined time, which would signal to the person that it's time to wake up. This could be a pleasant, uplifting aroma like lavender or citrus, which would help stimulate the mind and body.",
    "**Smart window shades**: Design a system where the window shades automatically adjust to let in a specific amount of natural light at a set time, simulating the sunrise. This would help regulate the body's circadian rhythms and wake the person up naturally.",
    "**Sleep-stage tracking**: Create a wearable device that tracks the user's sleep stages and wakes them up during a light sleep phase, making it easier to wake up feeling refreshed and alert.",
    "**Audio narrative**: Develop an AI-powered alarm clock that tells a engaging story or shares an interesting fact at a predetermined time, making waking up more enjoyable and interactive.",
    "**Vibration-based alarm**: Design a bed that incorporates a vibration system, where the mattress gently vibrates to wake the person up, similar to the sensation of a gentle bird chirp. This would be a subtle and non-intrusive way to wake up without a traditional alarm clock."
