    "**Adjustable Weight System**: Introduce a ski pole design that allows skiers to adjust the weight of the pole based on their preference or skiing conditions. This could involve a modular design where weights can be added or removed from the shaft, allowing for customization that enhances performance on different terrainsâ€”lighter for uphill and heavier for downhill stability.",
    "**Ergonomic Grip with Temperature Control**: Develop ski poles with ergonomic grips that have built-in temperature control technology. The grips could be heated for comfort on cold days or cooled on warmer days, ensuring that skiers maintain a firm grip without discomfort. This feature could be powered by rechargeable batteries integrated into the pole.",
    "**Multi-Function Tip Design**: Create ski poles with interchangeable tips that can adapt to various snow conditions. For example, tips could be designed for powder, ice, or hardpack, allowing skiers to easily switch out tips based on the terrain. This feature could also include a built-in retractable snow shovel or a small ice axe for emergencies.",
    "**Integrated Avalanche Safety Features**: Incorporate safety features into ski poles, such as a built-in avalanche beacon and a collapsible probe. This would allow skiers to have essential safety gear readily available without needing to carry extra equipment. The pole could also have a loud emergency whistle and a reflective surface for visibility in low-light conditions.",
    "**Personalized Pole Length Adjustment**: Design ski poles that allow for quick and easy adjustments in length, accommodating different skiing styles or conditions. This could involve a simple locking mechanism that allows skiers to adjust the pole length on-the-fly, making it easier to adapt to varying slopes or personal comfort levels."
