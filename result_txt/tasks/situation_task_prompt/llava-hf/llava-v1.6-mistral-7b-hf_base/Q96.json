    "Playing beach volleyball: Even without sand, you could still play beach volleyball. You could use a lightweight ball, such as a beach ball or a small sports ball, and a net made of rope or a lightweight fabric. The game would be a bit different from traditional sand volleyball, but it would still be a fun way to enjoy the beach.",
