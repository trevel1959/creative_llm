    "Social Hierarchy: If all humans had the ability to become invisible at will, it could lead to a new social hierarchy based on who can use their invisibility for the most strategic advantage. This could lead to a society where those who use their invisibility for personal gain are at the top, while those who use it for good are at the bottom.",
    "Crime and Punishment: With the ability to become invisible at will, crime rates could increase significantly as criminals could commit their crimes without fear of being caught. This could lead to a society where punishment for crimes becomes more severe, as the justice system struggles to maintain order.",
    "Privacy and Surveillance: The ability to become invisible at will could also lead to a new form of surveillance, where individuals can spy on others without being seen. This could lead to a society where privacy is no longer respected, and individuals are constantly monitored.",
    "Political Power: Those in power could use their ability to become invisible to make decisions without being seen by the public. This could lead to a society where politicians are no longer accountable to the people, and decisions are made in secret.",
    "Work and Productivity: With the ability to become invisible at will, individuals could work longer hours without being seen, leading to increased productivity. However, this could also lead to a society where people are overworked and stressed, leading to burnout and other negative consequences."
