    "Modular Construction: Modular construction involves assembling prefabricated units off-site and then transporting them to the construction site for installation. These units can be made from alternative materials like composite, concrete, or recycled plastic, ensuring that the structure is both sustainable and energy-efficient.",
    "3D Printing: Develop advanced 3D printing technology that can create structures from various materials, including recycled plastic or concrete. This would allow for on-site printing of building components, reducing the need for transportation and minimizing waste.",
    "Bamboo Alternatives: Develop sustainable bamboo alternatives that can mimic the properties of wood and stone. These could be used to create strong, lightweight, and eco-friendly building materials.",
    "Vertical Farming: Incorporate vertical farming into the building design, allowing for the growth of food and plants within the structure. This would provide a self-sufficient living space and help reduce the environmental impact of food production.",
    "Solar-Powered Construction: Utilize solar energy to power construction equipment and tools, reducing the reliance on fossil fuels and minimizing the carbon footprint of building processes."
