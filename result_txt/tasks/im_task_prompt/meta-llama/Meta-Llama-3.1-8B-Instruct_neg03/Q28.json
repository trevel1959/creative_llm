    "**Smart Helmet with Integrated Navigation and Safety Features**: Design a high-tech bicycle helmet with an integrated navigation system, alerting riders to potential hazards, such as potholes, debris, or pedestrians. The helmet could also include a built-in camera, capturing the rider's surroundings and providing real-time video feed to a companion app. This would enable riders to monitor their surroundings, share their route with friends and family, and even receive alerts for nearby bike lanes or bike-share stations.",
    "**Helmet with Built-in Air Quality Monitoring and Personalized Recommendations**: Develop a helmet that incorporates an air quality sensor, tracking the rider's exposure to pollutants and providing real-time data on the surrounding air quality. The helmet could then offer personalized recommendations for the rider's route, taking into account the air quality and suggesting alternative routes with cleaner air.",
    "**Helmet with Integrated Biometric Feedback and Wellness Tracking**: Create a helmet that incorporates biometric sensors, tracking the rider's vital signs, such as heart rate, blood pressure, and oxygen levels. The helmet could provide real-time feedback to the rider, alerting them to any potential health risks and offering personalized wellness recommendations. This could include suggestions for hydration, nutrition, or stress management.",
    "**Helmet with Built-in Augmented Reality Display and Virtual Navigation**: Design a helmet with an integrated augmented reality display, providing riders with virtual navigation cues, such as turn-by-turn directions and real-time traffic updates. The helmet could also include virtual objects, such as virtual bike lanes or virtual obstacles, to enhance the rider's experience and provide a more immersive ride.",
    "**Helmet with Integrated Social Features and Ride-Sharing Platform**: Develop a helmet that includes social features, such as live tracking and ride-sharing capabilities. Riders could connect with friends and family, sharing their route and location in real-time. The helmet could also include a ride-sharing platform, connecting riders with other cyclists or drivers in the area, reducing the need for personal vehicles and promoting a more sustainable transportation option.
