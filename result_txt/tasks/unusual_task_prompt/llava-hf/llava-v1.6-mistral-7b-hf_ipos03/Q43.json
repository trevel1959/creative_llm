    "Bicycle-Based Water Filter: The wheels of a bicycle can be adapted to filter water, creating a portable, human-powered water filtration system. The motion of the wheels spins a filter that can remove impurities from water, providing a sustainable and eco-friendly solution for clean drinking water.",
    "Bicycle-Based Wind Turbine: By attaching sails to the wheels of a bicycle, it can be transformed into a small-scale wind turbine. When pedaled, the bicycle generates electricity from the wind, which can be used to charge devices or power small appliances.",
    "Bicycle-Powered Lighting: A bicycle can be used to generate electricity through pedaling, which can then be used to power LED lights. This can create a portable, sustainable source of lighting for outdoor activities or as an emergency light source.",
    "Bicycle-Based Music Instrument: By attaching strings or pipes to the wheels of a bicycle and using the pedaling motion to generate sound, a unique bicycle-based musical instrument can be created. This could be used to create ambient music or even for educational purposes to teach children about sound and physics.",
    "Bicycle-Based Pump: The pedaling motion of a bicycle can be used to pump water or air. This can be useful for pumping water for irrigation or water supply in rural areas where traditional pumps may not be available."
