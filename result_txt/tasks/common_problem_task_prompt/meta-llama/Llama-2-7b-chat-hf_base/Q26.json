    "Create a Virtual Reality Experience: Develop a virtual reality experience that allows users to climb Mount Everest from the comfort of their own homes. The experience could include a guided ascent, with the user wearing a VR headset and using controllers to climb the mountain. The experience could also include obstacles and challenges to simulate the real climb, such as steep inclines, crevices, and harsh weather conditions.",
    "Build a Biodegradable Climbing Route: Design a biodegradable climbing route that can be easily removed and replaced with each ascent. This would reduce the environmental impact of climbing Mount Everest, as the route would not leave behind any permanent damage to the mountain. The route could be made from biodegradable materials such as bamboo or recycled plastic, and could be easily disassembled and removed after each climb.",
    "Create a Mountain Bike Route: Develop a mountain bike route that winds its way up the mountain, offering a unique and challenging ride for experienced cyclists. The route could include steep inclines, technical descents, and breathtaking views of the Himalayas. The route could also include rest stops and amenities for cyclists, such as food and water, and could be a great way to experience the mountain in a different way.",
    "Develop a Mobile App for Climbers: Create a mobile app that provides climbers with important information and resources for climbing Mount Everest. The app could include a route guide, weather forecasts, and updates on climbing conditions. The app could also include a community feature, allowing climbers to connect with each other and share their experiences.",
    "Host a Climbing Competition: Host a climbing competition on Mount Everest, where climbers can compete against each other to reach the summit. The competition could include different categories, such as speed climbing, endurance climbing, and bouldering. The competition could also include a team component, where climbers can work together to reach the summit. The event could be a great way to bring climbers together and raise awareness for the mountain and the climbing community."
