    "**Innovative Water Boiling System for Busy Individuals**: Create an electric kettle that utilizes advanced technology to ensure quick and efficient boiling of water. It could include features like a smart sensor that detects the type and quantity of water to adjust the heating time accordingly. The system can also learn user habits to predict when they typically need hot water and start preheating at those times.",
    "**Portable and Eco-Friendly Electric Kettle**: Develop a compact, lightweight electric kettle that uses eco-friendly materials and operates on rechargeable batteries. This product would be perfect for people who frequently travel or work in remote locations where access to electricity is limited. The kettle can also come with a solar panel attachment for recharging, making it even more environmentally friendly.",
    "**Smart Connectivity and Customization Options**: Introduce an electric kettle that connects via Bluetooth or Wi-Fi to a smartphone app. Users can set custom boiling temperatures, receive notifications when their water is ready, and even schedule boiling times. The app could also provide tips on how to optimize water usage, such as suggesting the best amount of water based on the intended use (e.g., tea vs. coffee).",
    "**Interactive and Educational Kettle**: Design an electric kettle that engages children by incorporating educational elements. For example, it could display information about the benefits of drinking hot water or provide trivia related to water consumption and conservation. It might also have a feature that allows kids to control the temperature settings using a simple interface, teaching them about heat and temperature concepts in a fun way.",
    "**Multifunctional Electric Kettle with Health Benefits**: Develop a kettle that not only boils water but also has additional health benefits. For instance, it could be equipped with a built-in air ionizer to purify the water before boiling. It could also include a feature that infuses water with essential minerals, making it more beneficial for health-conscious consumers. This multifunctional design would cater to individuals seeking wellness and convenience in their daily lives."
