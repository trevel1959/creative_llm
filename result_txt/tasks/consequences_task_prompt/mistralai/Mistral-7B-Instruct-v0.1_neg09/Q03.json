    "Social Hierarchy: With the increased lifespan, society would have to adapt to a new social hierarchy. Those who have lived longer would be seen as more experienced and knowledgeable, leading to a class system based on age. This could lead to a society where the elderly hold more power and influence, and the younger generation struggles to gain a foothold in the world.",
    "Overpopulation: If humans could live for 500 years, the population would continue to grow at an exponential rate. This could lead to overpopulation, which would put a strain on resources such as food, water, and energy. Governments would have to find new ways to manage the population and distribute resources fairly.",
    "Technological Advancements: With more time to live, humans would have more time to innovate and develop new technologies. This could lead to advancements in fields such as medicine, space exploration, and artificial intelligence. However, it could also lead to the creation of new weapons and other technologies that could be used for malicious purposes.",
    "Cultural Shifts: With a longer lifespan, cultures would have more time to evolve and change. This could lead to the development of new traditions, beliefs, and values. However, it could also lead to the loss of cultural heritage as older generations pass away and younger generations struggle to maintain the traditions of their ancestors.",
    "Environmental Impact: With a longer lifespan, humans would have more time to damage the environment. This could lead to irreversible damage to the planet, such as deforestation, pollution, and climate change. Governments and individuals would have to find new ways to live sustainably and protect the environment for future generations."
