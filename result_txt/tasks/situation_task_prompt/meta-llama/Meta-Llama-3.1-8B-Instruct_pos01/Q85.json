    "**Tattoo Archives**: In a world where digital data is lost, humans could rely on tattoo archives as a means of storing information. A designated group of artists and historians would be trained to record and preserve crucial information through intricate tattoos on willing individuals. These tattoos would serve as a permanent and durable record of history, allowing future generations to access and learn from the past. Confidence: 0.8",
    "**Mnemonics and Oral Tradition**: Without digital data, humans could rely on mnemonics and oral tradition to store and pass down information. Skilled storytellers and memory keepers would use techniques like rhyming, alliteration, and association to encode and remember historical events, scientific discoveries, and cultural practices. This method would require a strong emphasis on education, training, and community engagement. Confidence: 0.9",
    "**Bio-Luminescent Libraries**: In a post-digital world, bio-luminescent libraries could be created using microorganisms that produce light in response to specific stimuli. These libraries would store information in the form of glowing organisms, allowing future generations to access and learn from the past. This method would require a deep understanding of microbiology and genetics. Confidence: 0.7",
    "**3D Printed Knowledge Cubes**: 3D printing technology could be used to create durable, cube-shaped containers that store information in the form of physical artifacts, such as seeds, soil, or other natural materials. These knowledge cubes would serve as a tangible representation of historical events, scientific discoveries, and cultural practices. Confidence: 0.8",
    "**Earth-Based Data Storage**: Humans could store information by manipulating the Earth's terrain, creating intricate patterns and designs that reflect historical events, scientific discoveries, and cultural practices. This method would require a deep understanding of geology, cartography, and environmental science. Confidence: 0.9"
