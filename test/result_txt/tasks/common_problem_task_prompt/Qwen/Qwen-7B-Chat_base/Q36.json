    "\"Power Up Your City\" Campaign: This campaign could encourage homeowners to install solar panels by offering incentives such as tax credits, rebates, or discounts on installation costs. The campaign could also include educational workshops to help residents understand the benefits of solar power and how to make informed decisions about installing panels.",
    "Solar Power Swap Meet: Similar to a car swap meet, this event would allow homeowners to trade their unused solar panels for ones that are more suitable for their homes. This would create a community-driven marketplace where residents can easily access solar panels at affordable prices.",
    "Solar Power School: A school program could be created to educate children about renewable energy sources like solar power. Students could learn about the science behind solar panels, how they work, and the impact they have on the environment. The program could also include hands-on activities such as building solar-powered models or creating solar-powered art projects.",
    "Solar-Powered Community Gardens: Community gardens could be equipped with solar-powered irrigation systems, allowing them to operate without relying on electricity from the grid. This would not only reduce the garden's carbon footprint but also provide an opportunity for residents to grow their own food while learning about sustainable living practices.",
    "Solar-Powered Streetlights: Instead of traditional streetlights, cities could switch to solar-powered options. These lights would use energy from the sun during the day and store it in batteries for use at night. This would save money on energy costs and reduce the city's reliance on non-renewable resources. Additionally, solar-powered streetlights could be equipped with sensors that adjust brightness based on ambient light levels, further reducing energy consumption."
