    "**Global Network of Satellite Beacons**: Establish a network of satellite beacons that can transmit Morse code messages or even simple text messages. These beacons could be placed in strategic locations around the world, allowing individuals to send messages to each other across the globe. This system would require a coordinated effort between governments, organizations, and individuals to set up and maintain.",
    "**Radio Frequency (RF) Communication Networks**: Utilize RF communication networks, such as ham radios or shortwave radios, to establish contact with individuals in other countries. These networks would require a deep understanding of radio communication protocols and a willingness to learn and adapt to different frequencies and modulation schemes.",
    "**Optical Communication Systems**: Develop and deploy optical communication systems, such as laser-based communication networks, to transmit data across long distances. These systems would be particularly useful for sending encrypted messages or for establishing secure communication channels.",
    "**Pigeon-Based Communication**: Revive the ancient art of pigeon-based communication, where trained pigeons carry small messages or tokens between individuals. This method would require a large network of trained pigeons and a system for tracking and delivering messages.",
    "**The \"Human Network\"**: Establish a network of trusted individuals who serve as \"messengers\" between countries. These individuals would be trained to carry messages, often in the form of small notes or tokens, between countries. This method would rely on the trust and reliability of the individuals involved, as well as the ability to navigate complex international borders and regulations."
