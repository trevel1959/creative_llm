    "**Innovative Relay Race**: This sport combines elements of traditional relay races but introduces unique challenges. Teams are split into groups of four, each member performing a different activity. For example, one person might navigate through an obstacle course blindfolded, another would solve a complex puzzle, the third might need to cook a dish within a limited time, and the last person would have to give a speech on a given topic. This encourages teamwork, strategy, and quick thinking.",
    "**Air Sports**: A futuristic sport where participants perform aerial maneuvers using high-tech suits or drones. Competitors could be judged on their agility, precision, and creativity in flight. It could involve flying over urban landscapes, performing acrobatic stunts, or even navigating through a series of obstacles. The use of drones would make it accessible to a wide range of skill levels, while the suits could add a thrilling physical challenge.",
    "**Time Travel Relay**: In this game, players would be transported back in time (or forward, depending on the theme) and have to complete tasks that require them to use historical knowledge or adapt to the time period. For example, they might need to start a fire using only tools available in medieval times or navigate a city in the early 20th century without modern technology. It would combine history learning with adventure and problem-solving.",
    "**Virtual Reality Combat**: Participants wear VR headsets and engage in battles within a virtual world. The game could incorporate elements from various historical or fictional combat scenarios, requiring players to strategize, work in teams, and adapt to changing environments. Points could be awarded based on strategic decisions, team cooperation, and individual performance, creating a dynamic and immersive experience.",
    "**Eco-Challenge Marathon**: This marathon would not only test physical endurance but also environmental awareness. Participants would have to complete a long-distance run while collecting litter along the way, solving environmental puzzles, and performing eco-friendly tasks. The goal could be to clean up a specific area or reduce pollution in a particular community. This sport would encourage environmental stewardship and raise awareness about the importance of sustainability. "
