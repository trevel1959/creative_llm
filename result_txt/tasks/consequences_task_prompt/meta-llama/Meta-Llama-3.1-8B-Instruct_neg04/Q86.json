    "**Ecosystem Collapse**: Without sunlight, photosynthesis would cease, and plants would die. This would lead to a collapse of the entire food chain, as herbivores and carnivores rely on plants for sustenance. The lack of sunlight would also disrupt the water cycle, causing droughts and altering global weather patterns.",
    "**Global Temperature Drop**: The sun's energy is what maintains Earth's temperature. Without it, the planet would rapidly cool, potentially leading to a global average temperature drop of 10-20°C (18-36°F). This would have catastrophic effects on agriculture, leading to widespread crop failures and famine.",
    "**Disruption of Ocean Currents**: The sun's energy drives ocean currents, which play a crucial role in regulating global climate patterns. Without sunlight, these currents would slow or cease, leading to a dramatic shift in regional climate conditions. This could result in extreme weather events, such as hurricanes and droughts.",
    "**Atmospheric Changes**: The sun's ultraviolet (UV) radiation helps to maintain the Earth's atmospheric circulation patterns. Without it, the atmosphere would become stagnant, leading to a buildup of pollutants and greenhouse gases. This could accelerate climate change and make the planet even more inhospitable.",
    "**Human Societal Collapse**: The loss of sunlight would have a devastating impact on human societies, particularly those reliant on agriculture. Food shortages, economic collapse, and social unrest would likely follow. The lack of sunlight would also disrupt global supply chains, leading to widespread shortages of essential goods and services."
