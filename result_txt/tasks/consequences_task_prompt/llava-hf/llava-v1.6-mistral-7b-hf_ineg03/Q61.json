    "Barter system: In the absence of currency, people would revert to a barter system, where they would trade goods and services directly with one another. This would require a significant shift in the way people conduct business and would likely lead to a more localized economy.",
    "Government intervention: The government would likely step in to provide an alternative means of exchange, such as a government-issued voucher system or a digital currency that could be used for transactions. This would require significant infrastructure and logistics to implement and maintain.",
    "Hyperinflation: If all forms of currency disappeared suddenly, there could be a period of hyperinflation as people attempt to buy goods and services with the remaining money in circulation. This would lead to a rapid decline in the value of money and a significant increase in prices.",
    "Increased reliance on technology: In the absence of currency, people would likely turn to technology to facilitate transactions. This could include the use of cryptocurrencies, mobile payment apps, or blockchain-based systems that allow for secure and instantaneous transactions.",
    "Increased use of alternative forms of currency: Without traditional currency, people might turn to alternative forms of currency, such as precious metals, cryptocurrencies, or even time-based systems (e.g., time banks)."
