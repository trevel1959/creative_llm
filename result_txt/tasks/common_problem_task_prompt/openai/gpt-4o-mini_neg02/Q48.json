    "**Rule Development and Standardization**: Establishing clear and fair rules is crucial for any sport, and a lack of standardization can lead to confusion and disputes. If the rules are not well-defined or are subject to interpretation, it could create a barrier to acceptance and growth. To address this, a committee of experienced athletes and officials could be formed to draft comprehensive rules, which would then be tested and refined through pilot events.",
    "**Inclusivity and Diversity**: Ensuring that the new sport is inclusive and can be enjoyed by people of all ages, abilities, and backgrounds is vital. If the sport is perceived as exclusive or difficult to access for certain groups, it may struggle to gain traction. To promote inclusivity, the sport could incorporate adaptive versions for individuals with disabilities and create community outreach programs to engage underrepresented populations.",
    "**Marketing and Promotion**: Gaining visibility in a crowded sports market can be challenging. Without effective marketing strategies, the sport may struggle to attract participants and fans. Innovative promotional tactics, such as leveraging social media influencers or creating engaging video content that showcases the sport's excitement, could help generate interest and build a community around it.",
    "**Safety Concerns**: Any new sport must prioritize the safety of its participants. If the sport has a high risk of injury and lacks proper safety measures, it could deter people from trying it. Establishing a comprehensive safety protocol, including training for coaches and referees, mandatory protective gear, and a clear injury response plan, would be essential to ensure participants feel secure while playing.",
    "**Community Engagement and Support**: Building a supportive community around the new sport is crucial for its longevity. If local communities do not feel invested in the sport, it may fail to thrive. Organizing community events, such as exhibition matches, skill clinics, and social gatherings, can foster a sense of belonging and encourage local support. Collaborating with schools and local organizations can also help to embed the sport into the community fabric."
