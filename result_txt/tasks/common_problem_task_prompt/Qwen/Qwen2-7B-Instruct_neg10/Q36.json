    "**Space Limitations**: Not all homes have adequate roof space for the required number of solar panels to generate enough power for their needs. Homes with small roofs, low slopes, or structures that are shaded for part of the day might struggle to accommodate sufficient panels. Solutions could involve innovative designs for compact solar arrays or alternative installation methods, like ground-mounted systems or vertical installations.",
    "**Environmental Concerns**: Although solar energy is clean, the manufacturing process for solar panels involves significant energy use and the production of hazardous waste. Additionally, the disposal of old panels at the end of their lifecycle presents an environmental challenge. Strategies to mitigate these impacts include promoting recycling programs, using more sustainable materials, and encouraging the development of less resource-intensive manufacturing techniques.",
    "**Infrastructure and Grid Integration**: Integrating solar-generated power into existing electrical grids requires significant infrastructure upgrades. Cities would need to invest in grid modernization to handle variable power output from solar sources, manage peak demand, and ensure reliability. This could involve expanding distribution networks, implementing smart grid technologies, and enhancing energy storage solutions.",
    "**Public Acceptance and Awareness**: There might be resistance from some residents who are skeptical about the benefits or unsure about the aesthetic impact of solar panels on their neighborhood. Educational campaigns, showcasing the economic and environmental advantages of solar energy, could help increase public support. Additionally, engaging local communities in the planning process can foster a sense of ownership and reduce opposition.",
    "**Maintenance and Repair Challenges**: Solar panels require periodic maintenance to ensure they operate efficiently. This includes cleaning, checking for damage, and replacing parts when necessary. Homeowners might not have the skills or resources to perform these tasks regularly, leading to reduced performance and higher costs over time. Offering maintenance services through local businesses or establishing community-based repair programs could address this issue."
