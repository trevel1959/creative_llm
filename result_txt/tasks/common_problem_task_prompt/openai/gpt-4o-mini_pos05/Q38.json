    "**Scheduling Conflicts**: Coordinating the schedules of a large cast and crew can be a logistical nightmare. High-profile actors often have packed schedules, and delays in shooting can lead to conflicts with their availability. To address this, a detailed shooting schedule should be established well in advance, and flexibility should be built into the timeline to accommodate any unexpected delays.",
    "**Creative Differences**: When working with a diverse team of writers, producers, and actors, differing creative visions can lead to tension and conflict. This can result in a fragmented narrative or a disjointed film. To manage this, regular brainstorming sessions and open communication channels should be encouraged to ensure everyone’s ideas are heard and integrated into the project cohesively.",
    "**Technical Malfunctions**: The reliance on advanced technology for filming can lead to unexpected technical issues, such as camera failures or problems with special effects. These malfunctions can cause significant delays and frustration on set. To prevent this, it’s essential to have backup equipment readily available and to conduct thorough testing of all technology before filming begins.",
    "**Public Relations and Marketing**: A blockbuster film often comes with high expectations from the audience and the media. Negative press or a poorly executed marketing strategy can impact box office performance. To counter this, a dedicated PR team should be established to craft a compelling narrative around the film and engage with fans through social media and promotional events, ensuring a positive buzz leading up to the release.",
    "**Casting Challenges**: Finding the right actors for specific roles can be challenging, especially when aiming for a diverse cast that resonates with audiences. If key roles remain uncast or if actors drop out last minute, it can disrupt production. To avoid this, a thorough audition process should be conducted early on, and a list of potential backup actors should be maintained for each role."
