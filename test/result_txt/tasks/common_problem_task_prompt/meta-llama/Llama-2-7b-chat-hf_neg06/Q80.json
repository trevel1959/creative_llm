    "Greenery Wedding Decor: Instead of using traditional floral arrangements, consider incorporating lush greenery like eucalyptus, ferns, and succulents into your wedding decor. These plants are biodegradable, require minimal watering, and can be replanted after the wedding to offset carbon emissions. You can use them in centerpieces, bouquets, and even as a backdrop for the ceremony.",
    "Solar-Powered Lighting: Replace traditional lighting sources like candles and electric lights with solar-powered alternatives. Solar lights are eco-friendly and can be easily charged during the day, providing a beautiful ambiance during the evening ceremony and reception. You can also use string lights, lanterns, and fairy lights to create a whimsical and romantic atmosphere.",
    "Edible Wedding Favors: Instead of giving out traditional wedding favors like candles or chocolates, consider offering edible treats that are not only delicious but also eco-friendly. You can give out homemade cookies, fruit skewers, or even a small herb garden that guests can plant and enjoy. This not only reduces waste but also adds a personal touch to your wedding.",
    "Compostable Wedding Dress: For the bride, consider designing a wedding dress made from compostable materials like bamboo or organic cotton. This not only reduces waste but also creates a stunning and eco-friendly look. You can also incorporate recycled materials like old maps, newspaper, or fabric scraps to create a unique and sustainable wedding gown.",
    "Eco-Friendly Transportation: Instead of renting traditional limousines or party buses, consider eco-friendly transportation options like electric or hybrid vehicles. You can also encourage guests to carpool or use public transportation to get to the wedding venue. This not only reduces carbon emissions but also creates a fun and interactive experience for guests."
