    "**Shift in Societal Values**: With immortality, the perception of life and its value might drastically change. People may prioritize different experiences, such as knowledge acquisition, travel, or creative expression, over traditional life milestones like marriage and raising children. This could lead to a cultural renaissance as individuals seek to fill their eternal lives with meaning, but it may also result in existential crises for those who struggle to find purpose without the urgency of mortality.",
    "**Economic Disparities**: Access to immortality could create significant economic divides. If immortality is a privilege only available to the wealthy, it may exacerbate existing inequalities. The rich could live indefinitely while the poor face a life of struggle and early death. This disparity could lead to social unrest, as the disenfranchised demand equal access to life-extending technologies, potentially resulting in a class war or revolutionary movements.",
    "**Technological and Medical Advancements**: The quest for immortality could spur unprecedented advancements in medicine and technology. Research might focus on genetic engineering, cellular regeneration, and artificial intelligence to enhance human capabilities. While this could lead to incredible breakthroughs in health and longevity, it may also raise ethical concerns about \"playing God,\" and the potential for unintended consequences in the manipulation of human biology.",
    "**Environmental Impact**: As populations grow and people live longer, the environmental impact could be profound. Increased consumption of resources and energy could accelerate climate change and habitat destruction. Societies may need to adopt more sustainable practices and technologies to cope with the demands of an immortal population, leading to innovations in renewable energy and conservation methods. However, the initial impact could be detrimental if not managed properly.",
    "**Redefinition of Relationships**: Immortality could fundamentally change human relationships. With an indefinite lifespan, the dynamics of friendships, family ties, and romantic partnerships may evolve. People might form deeper connections, but they could also experience prolonged heartbreak and loss, as loved ones may still die from accidents or disease. This could lead to new social constructs, such as \"relationship contracts\" that outline the terms of emotional connections over centuries."
