    "**Self-Cleaning Filter System**: Develop a vacuum cleaner with a self-cleaning filter that uses a combination of vibration and airflow to dislodge dust and debris trapped in the filter. This would eliminate the need for users to manually clean or replace filters frequently, maintaining optimal suction power and reducing maintenance efforts.",
    "**Augmented Reality (AR) Navigation**: Incorporate AR technology that allows users to visualize their cleaning path through a mobile app or on the vacuum's display. Users could see where the vacuum has cleaned, areas that need attention, and receive real-time feedback on cleaning efficiency. This feature could also help in avoiding obstacles and ensuring thorough coverage.",
    "**Eco-Friendly Dust Disposal System**: Design a vacuum cleaner with a built-in composting feature for organic waste, such as pet hair and food crumbs. The vacuum would separate organic material from non-biodegradable debris, allowing users to easily dispose of compostable waste in an environmentally friendly manner, thus promoting sustainability.",
    "**Multi-Surface Adaptability**: Create a vacuum cleaner with adjustable brush heads that can seamlessly transition between various surfaces (carpet, hardwood, tile, etc.) without manual changes. This could involve a smart mechanism that detects the surface type and adjusts the brush bristle length and angle accordingly, optimizing cleaning efficiency for each surface.",
    "**Personalized Cleaning Profiles**: Introduce a user-friendly interface that allows multiple users to create personalized cleaning profiles. Each profile could include preferences for cleaning schedules, specific areas to focus on, and suction settings based on the userâ€™s lifestyle (e.g., pet owners vs. allergy sufferers). The vacuum would then automatically adjust its settings based on the selected profile."
