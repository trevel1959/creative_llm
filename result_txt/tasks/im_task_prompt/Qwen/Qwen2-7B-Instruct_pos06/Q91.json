    "**Eco-Friendly Luggage Tags**: Design a luggage tag that not only serves its purpose but also promotes environmental sustainability. The tag can be made from recycled materials such as reclaimed leather or plastic bottles. It can feature a QR code linking to information about the product's production process, emphasizing the eco-friendly aspects. The tag could also include tips on sustainable travel practices, encouraging travelers to adopt environmentally conscious habits.",
    "**Interactive Luggage Tags**: Develop a smart luggage tag that connects via Bluetooth to the traveler's smartphone. This tag can provide real-time tracking of the luggage, alerting the user if it goes out of range. Additionally, it can send notifications when the luggage is in a potentially dangerous location (like a lost baggage carousel) and even offer suggestions on how to locate it. The tag could also include an SOS button for emergencies.",
    "**Customizable Luggage Tags**: Offer a personalized luggage tag where users can customize their tags based on their preferences. They can choose colors, designs, fonts, and even add a personal message or name. This would make the tag unique and memorable, helping to distinguish their luggage from others at airports or hotels. ",
    "**Luggage Tag as a Travel Journal**: Create a dual-purpose luggage tag that functions as a journal. The back of the tag could have spaces for writing down the destination, date, and perhaps even a short note about the trip experience. Over time, this tag could become a small book filled with memories and stories from various trips, offering a sentimental value beyond just being a functional item.",
    "**Luggage Tag with Personal Health Information**: Design a luggage tag that includes a compartment for storing essential health information like allergies, medical conditions, and emergency contacts. This can be particularly useful for individuals traveling abroad where access to medical care might be limited. The tag can also have a clear, readable section that can be filled out before each trip and easily accessible in case of an emergency."
