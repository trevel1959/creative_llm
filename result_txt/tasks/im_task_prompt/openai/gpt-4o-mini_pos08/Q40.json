    "**Adaptive Tint Technology**: Develop sunglasses that automatically adjust their tint based on the intensity of sunlight and UV exposure. Using photochromic lenses combined with sensors, these sunglasses would transition from clear to dark in bright sunlight, providing optimal protection and comfort without the need for manual adjustments.",
    "**Health Monitoring Features**: Incorporate health monitoring sensors into the frames or lenses of the sunglasses to track vital signs like heart rate, body temperature, and UV exposure levels. This data could sync with a smartphone app to alert users about potential health risks, like overexposure to the sun, promoting a proactive approach to health and wellness.",
    "**Interchangeable Lens System**: Create a modular design for sunglasses that allows users to easily swap out lenses for different conditions. For example, users could switch to polarized lenses for fishing, blue light blocking lenses for screen time, or prescription lenses for those who need vision correction. This customization would cater to various activities and preferences.",
    "**Eco-Friendly Materials**: Design sunglasses using sustainable materials such as recycled plastics, biodegradable composites, or even innovative materials like mycelium (mushroom-based). Not only would this appeal to environmentally conscious consumers, but it would also reduce the overall carbon footprint of the eyewear industry.",
    "**Built-in Bluetooth Audio**: Integrate bone conduction speakers into the arms of the sunglasses, allowing users to listen to music or take calls without the need for additional headphones. This would provide a seamless audio experience while keeping the ears open to ambient sounds, making it safer for outdoor activities like biking or hiking."
