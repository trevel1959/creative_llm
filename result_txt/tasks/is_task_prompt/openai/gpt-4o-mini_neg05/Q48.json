    "Once in a vibrant meadow, there lived a horse named Zari, who was unlike any other. Instead of the usual brown or black coat, Zari sported striking zebra stripes that danced across her sleek body. The other animals were puzzled, whispering tales of magic and enchantment. Zari, however, embraced her uniqueness and galloped with pride. One day, a fierce storm threatened the meadow, and all the animals were frightened. Zari, with her bold stripes, led them to safety, her presence breaking the fear like sunlight through clouds. From that day on, the meadow celebrated Zari, the horse with zebra stripes, as a symbol of courage and individuality.",
