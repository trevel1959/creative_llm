    "Toothbrush with Built-in Toothpaste Dispenser: Create a toothbrush with a built-in toothpaste dispenser, eliminating the need for manual toothpaste squeezing. The dispenser could be located on the handle of the toothbrush, allowing for easy access and precise control over the amount of toothpaste used. This feature would save time and effort while brushing, and also help prevent messes.",
    "Smart Toothbrush with Brushing Analysis: Develop a toothbrush that can analyze your brushing technique and provide real-time feedback on areas where you need to improve. The toothbrush could have sensors built into the handle that track the brushing motion and pressure, and provide vibrations or sounds to alert you when you're brushing too hard or not brushing long enough. This feature would help ensure a more thorough and efficient cleaning of the teeth and improve overall oral hygiene.",
    "Toothbrush with Integrated Water Flosser: Design a toothbrush that incorporates an integrated water flosser, allowing for both brushing and flossing in one easy step.

This feature would save time and effort while brushing, and also provide a more thorough cleaning of the teeth.",
    "Toothbrush with Customizable Bristle Stiffness: Create a toothbrush with interchangeable bristle stiffness settings, allowing users to customize their brushing experience based on their individual needs. The toothbrush could have different bristle stiffness levels, from soft to extra-firm, and users could switch between them as needed for optimal cleaning and comfort. This feature would provide a more personalized and comfortable brushing experience.",
    "Toothbrush with Built-in Mouthwash Dispenser: Design a toothbrush with a built-in mouthwash dispenser, allowing users to easily rinse their mouth with mouthwash after brushing. The dispenser could be located on the handle of the toothbrush, and could be filled with a small amount of mouthwash before use."
