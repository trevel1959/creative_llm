    "Water-Based Transportation Hubs: Establish a network of interconnected water-based transportation hubs, serving as centralized ports for travelers to embark on their journey. These hubs could be built on artificial islands, floating structures, or strategically located along coastlines. Each hub would offer a range of transportation options, including boats, ships, and submersibles, connecting various destinations across the large body of water.",
    "Hydrofoil Expressways: Develop a network of hydrofoil expressways, similar to highways on land, that would allow for fast and efficient travel across the water. These expressways would be equipped with advanced propulsion systems, such as magnetohydrodynamic drives or air-cushion technology, to reduce drag and increase speed. This mode of transportation would be particularly useful for long-distance travel, as it would cut travel time significantly.",
    "Water-Based Roller Coasters: Create water-based roller coasters that would allow thrill-seekers to experience the rush of a roller coaster while on the water. These attractions would be designed with twists, turns, and loops, and could be themed around popular ocean creatures or destinations. Water-based roller coasters could be a unique and exciting way to experience the water, while also providing a fun and memorable experience for riders.",
    "Underwater Hotels and Resorts: Develop underwater hotels and resorts that would allow guests to experience the wonders of the ocean from the comfort of a luxurious accommodation. These hotels could be built using advanced materials and technology, such as clear acrylic walls and ceilings, allowing guests to observe marine life and the surrounding ocean environment without leaving their room. The hotels could also offer a range of amenities, including restaurants, bars, and spas, catering to the needs of guests.",
    "Water-Based Agriculture: Establish water-based agriculture systems, such as floating farms or aquaculture facilities, to provide a sustainable source of food for communities located near large bodies of water. These systems could be designed to produce a variety of crops, including fruits, vegetables, and seafood, using advanced hydroponics or aquaculture techniques. By utilizing the nutrient-"
