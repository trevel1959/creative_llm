    "**Glowing Plant Walls**: I would create a room with walls covered in bioluminescent plants like glow-in-the-dark mushrooms or glowing moss. These plants would absorb light during the day and emit a soft, ethereal glow at night, creating a unique and natural ambiance.",
    "**Luminescent Fiber Optics**: I would install a network of fiber optic cables throughout the room, which would be connected to a central light source. The fibers would be coated with a special luminescent material that would absorb and re-emit light, creating a web of soft, pulsing lights that would illuminate the space.",
    "**LED-Painted Ceiling**: I would use a specialized LED paint that can be applied to the ceiling to create a vibrant, glowing effect. The paint would contain micro-LEDs that would be powered by a thin, flexible circuit, allowing for intricate designs and patterns to be created. This would add a touch of modernity and whimsy to the room.",
    "**Firefly-Inspired Lanterns**: I would design and create lanterns that mimic the soft, flickering light of fireflies. Using a combination of LED lights, optical fibers, and a specially designed diffuser, the lanterns would create a warm, cozy glow that would be both functional and decorative.",
    "**Electroconductive Paint**: I would use a special electroconductive paint that can be applied to any surface, allowing it to conduct electricity and create a network of glowing lines and patterns. By connecting the paint to a power source and using a controller to program the lighting effects, I could create a dynamic, interactive lighting system that responds to movement and sound. [/INST] "
