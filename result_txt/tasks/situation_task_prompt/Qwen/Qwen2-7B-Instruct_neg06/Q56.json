    "**Creating a \"Selfie\" Using Light**: If mirrors vanished, one could still create a reflection-like image by strategically placing light sources around oneself. For example, imagine a setup where multiple small LED lights are arranged in a ring around a person. The light bounces off different surfaces (walls, floors, or even the ceiling) creating an illusion of a circular reflection. The angle of the light sources and their placement would need to be calculated precisely for the most realistic result.",
    "**Developing a Specialized Camera System**: A high-tech camera system could be designed that uses advanced imaging algorithms to project an image of the user onto a wall or surface behind them. This system would use depth-sensing cameras and sophisticated software to accurately map the user's body shape and position, then render a life-like reflection on the designated wall. This could be especially useful in dressing rooms, bathrooms, or personal grooming spaces.",
    "**Incorporating Virtual Reality (VR) Technology**: With VR headsets, one could experience a virtual mirror environment. By using the headset's camera to capture the user's face, it could then display a virtual reflection of the user in a digital environment. This would allow for a more interactive and immersive experience, as users could manipulate the virtual environment, change backgrounds, or even interact with their virtual reflection.",
    "**Using Smart Fabric Textiles**: Imagine a specially designed fabric that contains micro-reflective particles woven into its structure. When light hits this fabric, it reflects light back to the viewer, creating a reflective surface without the need for traditional mirrors. This could be used to create wearable garments or clothing items that act as mirrors when light shines on them, allowing people to see their reflections.",
    "**Developing a Holographic Reflection Technique**: A complex holographic projection system could be devised to create a 3D reflection of the user. By projecting light from multiple angles, the system could generate a lifelike 3D image of the user floating in mid-air. This could be particularly appealing for artistic, performance, or even therapeutic purposes, providing a unique way for individuals to see themselves in a highly engaging and immersive manner."
