    "Soap Dispenser with a Built-in Scent Diffuser: Create a soap dispenser that not only dispenses soap but also releases a pleasant scent into the air. This can be achieved by incorporating a small fragrance diffuser into the design of the dispenser. The diffuser can be filled with a few drops of essential oil or fragrance, and it will release a consistent and pleasant scent as the soap is dispensed. This would be a unique and thoughtful addition to any bathroom, as it combines two functionalities into one device.",
    "Smart Soap Dispenser with Motion Sensors: Design a soap dispenser that uses motion sensors to detect when someone is approaching and automatically dispenses the desired amount of soap. This would eliminate the need for manual activation and ensure that the soap is always within reach. The dispenser can be equipped with a small LED light or display that indicates when the soap is running low, providing an additional layer of convenience.",
    "Soap Dispenser with a Built-in Cleaning System: Create a soap dispenser that includes a built-in cleaning system. The dispenser can have a small compartment or tray that holds cleaning solution, such as rubbing alcohol or disinfectant. When the soap is dispensed, the cleaning solution is automatically released into the soap dispenser, ensuring that it stays clean and hygienic. This would be particularly useful in high-traffic areas, such as public restrooms, where the soap dispenser may be used by many people.",
    "Soap Dispenser with a Customizable Dispensing Volume: Design a soap dispenser that allows users to customize the amount of soap dispensed with each use. This can be achieved through a simple mechanism, such as a dial or button that adjusts the amount of soap dispensed. This would be particularly useful for people who prefer a smaller amount of soap or for those who want to conserve soap.",
    "Soap Dispenser with a Built-in Nightlight: Create a soap dispenser that includes a small built-in nightlight. This can be particularly useful in bathrooms with poor lighting, as it provides an additional source of light for grooming and hygiene. The nightlight can be powered by a small LED light"
