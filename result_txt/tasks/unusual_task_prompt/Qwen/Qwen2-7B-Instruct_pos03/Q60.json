This idea merges fashion storage with smart home technology.",
    "**Customizable Fashion Hangers**: Develop a line of hangers that can be customized to suit individual style preferences.

These hangers could also come with clips or loops to accommodate various clothing types, such as shirts, dresses, or suits. This idea emphasizes personalization in a practical way.",
    "**Sustainable Fashion Hangers**: Design eco-friendly hangers made from recycled materials like cardboard, bamboo, or reclaimed wood. These hangers could be designed to break down naturally at the end of their life cycle, reducing environmental impact. Additionally, they could feature a biodegradable coating or be reusable and washable, encouraging sustainable practices in clothing storage.",
    "**Heated Clothing Hangers**: In寒冷 climates, develop a heated hanger that keeps clothes warm, making them more comfortable to wear right out of the closet. This hanger could be battery-powered or solar-powered, depending on the design. It could also include a timer to prevent overheating and ensure energy efficiency. This idea combines warmth and convenience, making it perfect for winter weather.",
    "**Interactive Fashion Hangers**: Create a series of hangers that double as mirrors, but also display information about the garment, such as care instructions, brand details, and even fashion tips related to the item. These hangers could use touch screens or projection technologies to provide interactive content.
