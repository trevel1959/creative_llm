    "Bio-based Building Materials: In a world without natural materials, houses could be built using bio-based building materials like mycelium, a type of fungus that can be grown and molded into various shapes. Mycelium-based building materials are lightweight, insulating, and can be composted at the end of their lifespan, reducing waste.",
    "3D Printed Housing: With the advancement of 3D printing technology, it's possible to create entire structures using a combination of recycled materials and locally sourced materials like plastics, metals, and glass. These materials can be mixed and combined to create a durable and sustainable building material that can be printed on-site.",
    "Living Trees: Inspired by the ancient Japanese practice of \"tree houses,\" living trees could be used as the primary structural element of a house. Trees with a high density of cellulose and lignin, like bamboo or eucalyptus, could be harvested and used as beams, columns, and walls. This approach not only reduces waste but also creates a unique and sustainable living space.",
    "Smart Fabrics: Advanced textiles like Kevlar, carbon fiber, and smart fabrics could be used to create lightweight and durable building materials. These fabrics can be woven into various shapes and patterns to create walls, roofs, and floors that are both strong and flexible. Smart fabrics can also monitor temperature, humidity, and other environmental factors, ensuring a comfortable living space.",
    "Atmospheric Water Harvesting: In a world without natural materials, houses could be built using a system that harvests water from the atmosphere. This system would involve creating a network of pipes and membranes that can extract water vapor from the air and condense it into liquid water. This water could then be used for drinking, irrigation, and other household purposes, reducing the need for traditional water sources."
