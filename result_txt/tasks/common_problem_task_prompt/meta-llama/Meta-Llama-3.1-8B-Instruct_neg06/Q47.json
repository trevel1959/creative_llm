    "**The Modular Masterpiece**: Design a computer that's a modular, 3D-printed sculpture. Each component, from the CPU to the RAM, is a separate, interchangeable module that can be easily swapped out or upgraded. The system is held together by a lattice of 3D-printed rods, creating a visually striking and futuristic design.",
    "**The Retro-Futuristic Revival**: Create a computer that pays homage to the classic computers of the past, while still incorporating modern technology. The system features a sleek, retro-style case with a nostalgic color scheme, complete with a glowing blue LED strip and a vintage-style keyboard. However, beneath the surface, the computer boasts cutting-edge components and a powerful processor.",
    "**The Water-Cooled Wonder**: Build a computer that's cooled entirely by water. The system features a custom-built water cooling system, complete with a 3D-printed radiator and a network of thin tubes that circulate water through the system. The computer's case is designed to resemble a futuristic aquarium, with the water cooling system visible through a transparent side panel.",
    "**The DIY Dynamo**: Create a computer that's powered entirely by renewable energy. The system features a custom-built solar panel or wind turbine that generates electricity, which is then stored in a high-capacity battery. The computer's case is designed to resemble a miniature power plant, with a transparent panel showing the inner workings of the renewable energy system.",
    "**The Shape-Shifting System**: Design a computer that can change its shape and form to suit different tasks and environments. The system features a 3D-printed case that can be easily reconfigured to fit different components and accessories, such as a keyboard or monitor. The computer can also be folded up and stored in a compact, portable package, making it ideal for use in a variety of settings. [/INST] "
