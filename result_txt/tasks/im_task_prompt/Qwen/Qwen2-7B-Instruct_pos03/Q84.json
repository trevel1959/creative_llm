    "**Interactive Coat Rack with Smart Technology**: Design a coat rack that integrates smart technology to offer convenience and security. The idea involves a rack with embedded sensors that detect the presence of a user and can automatically adjust the lighting in the room. It could also feature a touch screen interface where users can control their home's temperature, check weather forecasts, or even set reminders for upcoming events.",
    "**Customizable Coat Rack with Memory Foam Hangers**: Create a coat rack with memory foam hangers that adapt to the shape of the garment hung on them. This not only prevents damage to delicate fabrics but also offers a personalized touch to the rack. Each hanger could have adjustable settings for different clothing items, like jackets, dresses, and shirts. Users can customize these settings based on their preferences.",
    "**Eco-Friendly Coat Rack with Solar Panels**: Design a coat rack made from sustainable materials such as bamboo or reclaimed wood, which also features solar panels integrated into its structure. This allows the rack to charge itself using solar energy, reducing its reliance on electrical power. Additionally, the solar panels could power small LED lights on the rack, providing ambient lighting without additional electricity consumption.",
    "**Themed Coat Racks for Different Decor Styles**: Develop a series of coat racks tailored to various interior design themes, such as rustic, minimalist, industrial, or bohemian. Each rack would reflect the specific style through its material choice, color palette, and design elements. For instance, a rustic coat rack might use distressed wood and metal hooks, while a minimalist one could feature sleek, geometric shapes and clean lines.",
    "**Sustainable and Recyclable Coat Rack**: Create a coat rack made from entirely recyclable materials, such as recycled plastic bottles or reclaimed metals. The design should be modular, allowing users to easily disassemble and recycle the components when no longer needed. This not only reduces environmental impact but also encourages consumers to participate in sustainability efforts by upcycling old furniture parts into new coat racks."
