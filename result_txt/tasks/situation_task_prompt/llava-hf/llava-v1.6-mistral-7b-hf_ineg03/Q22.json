    "Walking and Cycling: Pedestrians and cyclists would have to navigate the city on foot or by bicycle, which could lead to a healthier and more environmentally friendly lifestyle. Bike-sharing programs and pedestrian-friendly infrastructure would become more important.",
    "Ride-Sharing Services: Ride-sharing services such as Uber, Lyft, or taxi services would become more popular and necessary for moving around, as they could provide on-demand transportation options in the absence of roads.",
    "Boat Transportation: If roads are no longer an option, waterways could be utilized for transportation. Boats, ferries, or even water taxis could be used to navigate through the city. This could lead to the development of water-based public transportation systems.",
    "Developing Vertical Transportation: With no roads, vertical transportation solutions such as high-rise buildings with elevators or skywalks connecting buildings could become more prevalent. This could change the way people live, work, and travel within the city.",
    "Implementing Drone Delivery: Drones could be used to deliver goods and services, reducing the need for ground transportation. This could also lead to the development of drone-based public transportation systems."
