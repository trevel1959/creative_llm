    "Virtual Reality Steering Wheel: Imagine a steering wheel that immerses the driver in a virtual reality world. The wheel would be equipped with sensors and cameras that track the driver's movements, allowing them to control the virtual vehicle with precision. This would be especially useful for drivers who are unable to operate a physical vehicle due to disabilities or medical conditions.",
    "Smart Steering Wheel: A smart steering wheel that can detect and respond to a driver's emotions. The wheel would be equipped with sensors that monitor the driver's heart rate, facial expressions, and body language. Based on this data, the wheel would adjust the vehicle's performance, such as the acceleration and braking, to provide a more comfortable and enjoyable driving experience.",
    "Interactive Steering Wheel: An interactive steering wheel that allows drivers to control various in-car features through gestures and touch inputs. For example, the driver could tap on the wheel to change the music, adjust the temperature, or activate the GPS. This would provide a more intuitive and hands-on way of controlling the vehicle's functions, reducing the need for drivers to take their eyes off the road.",
    "Adaptive Steering Wheel: An adaptive steering wheel that adjusts its shape and size based on the driver's preferences and driving conditions. The wheel would be made of a flexible material that can change shape to accommodate different driver sizes and styles. Additionally, the wheel could adjust its size and shape based on the driving conditions, such as tightening up in sharp turns or loosening up on straightaways.",
    "Augmented Reality Steering Wheel: An augmented reality steering wheel that overlays digital information onto the real wheel. The wheel would be equipped with a display screen that shows important information such as the vehicle's speed, navigation, and traffic updates. This would provide a more immersive and interactive driving experience, allowing drivers to access important information without taking their eyes off the road."
