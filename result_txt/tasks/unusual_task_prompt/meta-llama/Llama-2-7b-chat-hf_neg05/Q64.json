    "A smart thermos that uses AI to optimize temperature control: The thermos of the future could be equipped with a built-in AI system that learns your temperature preferences and adjusts the temperature of your drink accordingly. For example, if you prefer your coffee hot, the AI will keep the temperature at a consistent 180°F. But if you prefer your tea lukewarm, the AI will adjust the temperature to 140°F. This smart thermos would ensure that your drink is always at the perfect temperature, eliminating the need for constant adjustments.",
    "A thermos with a built-in coffee brewing system: Envision a thermos that not only keeps your drink hot but also brews your coffee or tea on the go. The thermos could have a built-in coffee or tea bag compartment, and a small heating element that brews your drink to perfection. This would eliminate the need for a separate coffee or tea maker, making it the ultimate travel companion for coffee or tea lovers.",
    "A thermos with a self-healing function: Imagine a thermos that can repair itself if it's damaged. The thermos could be made with a special material that can detect and repair cracks or leaks, ensuring that your drink stays hot for longer. This would eliminate the need for frequent repairs or replacements, making it a more durable and cost-effective option.",
    "A thermos that uses solar power: A thermos that harnesses the power of the sun to keep your drink hot could be a game-changer. The thermos could have a built-in solar panel that charges a small battery, which powers a heating element that keeps your drink hot. This would eliminate the need for electricity or batteries, making it a more sustainable and eco-friendly option.",
    "A thermos that monitors your drink's temperature in real-time: A thermos with a built-in temperature sensor that monitors the temperature of your drink in real-time could be a useful innovation. The thermos could have an app that tracks the temperature of your drink and sends notifications if it deviates from your preferred temperature. This would ensure that your drink is always at the perfect temperature, eliminating the need for constant checks."
