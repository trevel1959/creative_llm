    "**Wheeled Mobility Device**: This idea involves using a specially designed wheelchair or a motorized scooter to navigate through your environment. These devices can be customized to fit your specific needs and can provide stability while allowing you to move around independently. The wheelchair might have features like a reclining backrest for comfort during long periods of sitting, and the motorized scooter could have adjustable heights and speeds.",
    "**Portable Walking Frame with Wheels**: A combination of a walking frame and a set of wheels that can be attached or detached as needed. This would allow for assistance when walking but also provide mobility when standing is not possible. The frame would typically have handles for support, and the wheels would be designed to glide smoothly on various surfaces.",
    "**Assisted Robotic Arm**: Using advanced robotics, an arm could be designed to help you perform tasks that require reaching and lifting. This robotic arm would be attached to your body (or a stable base) and controlled by sensors that detect your movements or by a joystick. It could be used to carry items, reach high shelves, or even assist in personal hygiene tasks.",
    "**Voice-Activated Smart Home System**: Implementing a comprehensive smart home system that uses voice commands can greatly enhance your ability to navigate your living space. Voice assistants like Amazon Alexa or Google Assistant can control lights, appliances, and even open doors, making daily activities more accessible. This system would reduce the need for physical movement and provide independence in managing your environment.",
    "**Exoskeleton Suit**: An exoskeleton suit designed specifically for individuals who cannot stand would provide support and aid in movement. This suit would be lightweight and adjustable to fit different body types. It would include sensors to monitor your movements and assist in standing up, walking, and even climbing stairs. The exoskeleton could be powered by electricity or hydraulics, depending on its design, and would be customizable to offer varying levels of assistance based on the user's needs."
