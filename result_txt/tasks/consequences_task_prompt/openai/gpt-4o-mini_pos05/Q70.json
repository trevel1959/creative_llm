    "**Impact on Technology**: Many technologies, especially those reliant on electromagnetic waves, would need to be re-engineered. For example, communication systems that rely on satellite technology would experience increased latency, as signals would take longer to travel between Earth and satellites. This could lead to significant delays in global communications, impacting everything from the internet to GPS systems, and necessitating a complete overhaul of our technological infrastructure.",
    "**Astronomical Observations**: The way we observe and understand the universe would change dramatically. If light travels slower, the information we receive from distant stars and galaxies would take longer to reach us. This would mean that we would be looking at the universe as it was much further in the past. This could lead to confusion in astronomical models and theories, as the data we rely on to understand cosmic events would be outdated by a larger margin than currently experienced.",
    "**Changes in Physics**: The fundamental laws of physics would need reevaluation. The equations governing electromagnetism, thermodynamics, and even gravity might change, leading to new discoveries and theories. For instance, the fine-structure constant, which governs the strength of electromagnetic interactions, could shift, potentially altering atomic structures and chemical reactions, possibly leading to the emergence of new materials or even forms of matter.",
    "**Visual Perception Alteration**: Our visual perception would be significantly affected. Colors, brightness, and the way we see motion would all change, as our eyes rely on the speed of light to process visual information. For example, the color spectrum might appear different, and motion might seem sluggish or disjointed. Artists and designers would have to rethink how they create visual art, as the fundamental principles of color theory and design would shift.",
    "**Biological Implications**: Biological processes that depend on light, such as photosynthesis, would be disrupted. Plants might evolve to adapt to a slower light speed, potentially leading to new forms of flora that utilize different wavelengths or energy sources. This could create a ripple effect through the food chain, impacting herbivores, carnivores, and the entire ecosystem. Human biology might also adapt in unforeseen ways, leading to changes in our physiology and perhaps even our evolutionary path."
