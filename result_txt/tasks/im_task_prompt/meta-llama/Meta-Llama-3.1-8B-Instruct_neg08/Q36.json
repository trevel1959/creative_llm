    "**Ergonomic Knife**: Create a knife with an ergonomic design that fits comfortably in the user's hand, reducing strain and discomfort during prolonged use. The handle could be contoured to fit the natural curve of the hand, and the blade could be angled to reduce wrist movement.",
    "**Knife with Built-in Sharpener**: Develop a knife with a built-in sharpener that can be activated with a simple button press. This would eliminate the need for separate sharpening tools and make maintenance a breeze.",
    "**Smart Knife Blade**: Design a knife blade with a micro-electromechanical system (MEMS) that can adjust its sharpness and angle in real-time. This would allow the knife to adapt to different cutting tasks and materials.",
    "**Multi-Tool Knife**: Create a knife that doubles as a multi-tool, with features such as a bottle opener, screwdriver, and wire stripper. This would make the knife a more versatile and essential tool in various situations.",
    "**Knife with Integrated Measuring Function**: Develop a knife with a built-in measuring function, allowing users to measure ingredients or materials with precision. This could be achieved through a small scale or a laser-based measurement system."
