    "**Adaptive Technology Revolution**: In the absence of corrective eyewear, people with poor vision would rely heavily on advanced technologies to enhance their visual acuity. Wearable devices like smart contact lenses, augmented reality (AR) glasses, and implantable visual prosthetics would become the norm. These innovative solutions would utilize AI, machine learning, and biometrics to provide real-time visual enhancements, allowing individuals to navigate their daily lives with increased confidence and independence.",
    "**Sensory Adaptation and Training**: Humans have an incredible capacity for adaptation, and people with poor vision would need to rely on their other senses to compensate. Specialized training programs would focus on developing exceptional auditory, tactile, and spatial awareness skills. This would involve techniques like echolocation, Braille literacy, and spatial reasoning exercises to help individuals navigate their surroundings more effectively.",
    "**Social and Community Support**: In the absence of corrective eyewear, people with poor vision would need to lean on their support networks and communities for assistance. This could lead to the development of innovative social services, such as: \t* Volunteer-based escort services for daily tasks",
    "**Biomechanical Enhancements**: As technology advances, people with poor vision might opt for biomechanical enhancements to improve their visual acuity. This could involve: \t* Bionic eyes with implantable sensors and neural interfaces",
    "**Evolutionary Adaptations**: In the long term, humans might undergo evolutionary adaptations to compensate for the loss of corrective eyewear. This could involve genetic mutations that enhance visual acuity or other senses, such as: \t* Enhanced low-light vision"
