    "**Aurora**: The Aurora is a hybrid instrument that combines elements of a harp, a piano, and a theremin. Its soundbox is a translucent, glowing sphere that can change colors depending on the music being played. The instrument has 24 strings, each with a unique, hand-carved wooden resonator that amplifies and modifies the sound. The player uses a combination of fingerpicking, harp-style plucking, and theremin-like gestures to create a wide range of tonal colors and textures.",
    "**Echoflux**: The Echoflux is a percussion instrument that uses a network of suspended, hollow tubes to create a soundscape of echoes and reverberations. The player strikes the tubes with mallets, sticks, or even their bare hands, generating a kaleidoscope of timbres and resonance patterns. The Echoflux also incorporates sensors that detect the player's movements, allowing for real-time manipulation of the sound through a software interface.",
    "**Sonic Bloom**: The Sonic Bloom is an electronic instrument that uses a matrix of LED lights and sensors to create a visual representation of sound. The player wears a specially designed glove with sensors that track their finger movements, which are then translated into a rich, immersive soundscape. The Sonic Bloom can generate a wide range of sounds, from delicate, flower-like melodies to intense, explosive textures.",
    "**Gravity Well**: The Gravity Well is a stringed instrument that uses a combination of magnetic fields and gravity to create a unique, three-dimensional sound. The player plucks the strings with a special bow that generates a localized magnetic field, which attracts and repels the strings in a way that creates complex, wavering patterns. The Gravity Well also incorporates sensors that detect the player's movements, allowing for real-time manipulation of the sound.",
    "**Aerofoil**: The Aerofoil is a wind instrument that uses a specially designed, wing-like structure to generate a wide range of tonal colors and textures. The player blows air through the Aerofoil, which is shaped like a wing, creating a range of sounds from soft, airy whispers to loud, piercing screams. The Aerofoil also incorporates sensors that detect the player's breath control, allowing for real-time manipulation of the sound through a software interface."
