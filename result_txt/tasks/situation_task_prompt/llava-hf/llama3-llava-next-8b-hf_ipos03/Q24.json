    "\"Visionary Wearables\" - A line of wearable technology that utilizes smart glasses to enhance vision. These glasses would use augmented reality to overlay text, numbers, and images on the real world, allowing users to see the information they need at a glance. The glasses could also include built-in sensors that detect light levels and adjust the screen brightness accordingly, reducing eye strain.",
    "\"Visual Assistants\" - A service that pairs visually impaired individuals with specially trained dogs or other animals that have been trained to assist with daily tasks. These animals would be equipped with specialized vision aids, such as high-contrast collars and vests, to help them better assist their handlers.",
    "\"The Seeing Eye\" - A wearable device that uses a combination of sensors and artificial intelligence to provide real-time visual information. The device would be worn on the wrist and use accelerometers and gyroscopes to detect the user's movements, then overlay relevant information on the real world through a small, see-through display.",
    "\"Visionary Virtual Reality\" - A platform that allows users to explore virtual environments that are tailored to their specific vision needs. Users could choose from a variety of virtual environments, from cityscapes to nature trails, and the platform would adjust the graphics and sound effects to accommodate their visual impairment.",
    "\"Visual Navigation\" - A GPS system that uses voice guidance to help visually impaired individuals navigate. The system would provide turn-by-turn directions, along with information about the distance to the next turn and the type of road (e.g., \"You are approaching a one-way street\"). The system could also use haptic feedback, such as a vibrating wristband, to alert users to changes in their environment."
