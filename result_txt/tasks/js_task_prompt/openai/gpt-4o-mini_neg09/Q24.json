    "**Smart Mobility Network**:    A comprehensive smart mobility network would replace traditional vehicles with electric autonomous public transport options. The city would feature an integrated system of self-driving buses, trams, and bicycles, all connected through a user-friendly app that provides real-time information on schedules, routes, and traffic conditions. Pedestrian-friendly pathways and bike lanes would encourage walking and cycling, promoting a healthier lifestyle while reducing carbon emissions.",
    "**Energy-Positive Buildings**:    Every building in the city would be designed to be energy-positive, meaning they generate more energy than they consume. This would be achieved through solar panels, wind turbines, and innovative materials that maximize energy efficiency. Buildings would also be equipped with smart technology that optimizes energy usage based on occupancy and weather conditions. The excess energy generated could be fed back into the cityâ€™s grid, powering public services and homes.",
    "**Community Hubs and Maker Spaces**:    The city would feature multiple community hubs that serve as centers for collaboration, creativity, and learning. These hubs would include maker spaces equipped with tools for woodworking, metalworking, and digital fabrication, encouraging innovation and entrepreneurship. Workshops and classes would be offered to teach residents new skills, fostering a sense of community and collaboration. The hubs would also host events, markets, and performances, strengthening social ties among residents.",
    "**Integrated Water Management System**:    A cutting-edge water management system would ensure that the city efficiently captures, purifies, and recycles water. Rainwater harvesting systems would be installed on buildings and streets, channeling water into underground reservoirs. Advanced filtration systems would treat wastewater for reuse in irrigation and non-potable applications. The city would also feature bioswales and permeable pavements to reduce runoff and prevent flooding, creating a resilient urban environment.",
    "**Cultural Exchange Zones**:    The city would celebrate diversity through designated cultural exchange zones where residents can share their heritage, art, and cuisine. These zones would host cultural festivals, art exhibitions, and culinary fairs, fostering a sense of belonging and understanding among different communities. Interactive installations and public art would reflect the city's diverse history and promote dialogue among residents, creating a vibrant and inclusive atmosphere."
