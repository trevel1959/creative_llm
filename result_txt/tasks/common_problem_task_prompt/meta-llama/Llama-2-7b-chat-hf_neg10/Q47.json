    "Compatibility Issues: Another potential problem that may arise when building a computer from scratch is compatibility issues between different components. For example, the motherboard may not be compatible with the processor or memory, which can cause system instability or prevent the computer from functioning properly. To address this issue, you could research the compatibility of each component before purchasing and double-check their compatibility during the assembly process.",
    "Power Supply Insufficiency: A power supply unit (PSU) that is insufficient for the computer's needs can cause problems such as system crashes, slow performance, and even damage to the components. When building a computer from scratch, it is important to choose a PSU that is sufficient for the computer's power requirements to avoid these issues.",
    "Installation Difficulties: When assembling the computer, you may encounter difficulties with installation, such as difficulty connecting cables or mounting components. To address these issues, you could refer to online tutorials or seek the help of a professional.",
    "BIOS Configuration: The BIOS (Basic Input/Output System) configuration can also cause problems when building a computer from scratch. If the BIOS settings are not configured correctly, the computer may not boot properly or function as intended. To address this issue, you could refer to the user manual or seek the help of a professional.",
    "Driver Issues: When building a computer from scratch, you may encounter issues with drivers, such as compatibility problems or missing drivers. These issues can cause problems such as system crashes or slow performance. To address these issues, you could refer to the manufacturer's website or seek the help of a professional."
