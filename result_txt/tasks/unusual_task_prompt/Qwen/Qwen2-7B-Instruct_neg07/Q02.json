    "**Rubber Hand Illusion (RHI) in Therapy**: You can create a unique application of the Rubber Hand Illusion technique in therapy sessions. For instance, you could use a digital rubber hand that can be moved in real-time to correspond with movements made by the patient's real hand. This would allow for a more engaging and interactive experience, enhancing the therapeutic process by providing immediate feedback and visual reinforcement.",
    "**Artistic Expression with Rubber Hands**: Utilize rubber hands as a medium for artistic expression. Create life-sized or smaller versions of rubber hands and use them in various art projects such as sculpture, painting, or even as part of wearable art. You could incorporate these into installations or performances, exploring themes related to identity, ownership, or human interaction.",
    "**Interactive Educational Tool**: Develop an educational tool using a rubber hand that teaches children about body parts and functions in a fun and interactive way. The rubber hand could have different tactile sensors that respond to touch or pressure, teaching kids about sensory perception and motor skills. This could also be extended to teach basic medical procedures or anatomy in a simplified, hands-on manner.",
    "**Sensory Integration and Motor Skill Development**: Use a rubber hand as a training aid for individuals looking to improve their sensory integration and motor skills. For example, someone recovering from a stroke might benefit from exercises where they manipulate the rubber hand to mimic movements of their own limbs, thus enhancing neural connections and improving dexterity.",
    "**Virtual Reality Interface**: Combine a rubber hand with VR technology to create a new form of interface for computer interaction. By wearing gloves equipped with sensors, users can control virtual objects through their physical movements, which are projected onto a virtual rubber hand in the VR environment. This could lead to new applications in gaming, simulation training, or even assistive technologies for those with disabilities."
