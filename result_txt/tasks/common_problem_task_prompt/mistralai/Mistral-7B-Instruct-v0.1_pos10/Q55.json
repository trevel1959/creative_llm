    "Developing an Eco-tourism Destination: One of the most effective ways to generate revenue for the conservation park is to develop it as an eco-tourism destination. Visitors can be attracted to the park by offering activities such as hiking, camping, wildlife watching, and nature photography tours. This will also create employment opportunities for the local community.",
    "Implementing a Sustainable Agriculture Program: The park can also establish a sustainable agriculture program that focuses on organic farming and beekeeping. This will help preserve the natural environment while also providing a source of income for the park.",
    "Hosting Educational Programs: The park can host educational programs for schools and universities to teach students about conservation and environmental science. This will help raise awareness about the importance of conservation and create a new generation of conservationists.",
    "Partnering with Local Businesses: The park can partner with local businesses to create a sustainable supply chain. For example, the park can partner with local farmers to provide fresh produce for the park's restaurants, and with local craftsmen to provide handmade goods for the park's gift shop.",
    "Creating a Wildlife Corridor: The park can create a wildlife corridor that connects the park to other nearby conservation areas. This will help preserve biodiversity and provide a safe haven for endangered species. The park can also establish a research station to study the wildlife and their behavior in the corridor."
