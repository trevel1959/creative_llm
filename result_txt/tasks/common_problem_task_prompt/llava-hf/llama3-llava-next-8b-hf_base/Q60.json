    "Volunteer Recruitment: Another potential problem is recruiting volunteers to help with the organization's mission. Nonprofit organizations often rely on volunteers to carry out their work, but finding enough qualified and dedicated volunteers can be difficult. To address this, the organization could consider offering training and support to volunteers, or partnering with local schools or community organizations to access a larger pool of potential volunteers.",
    "Program Development: A third potential problem is developing effective programs to promote children's literacy. The organization may need to conduct research to determine the most effective methods for teaching reading and writing skills, and then design programs that are engaging and accessible to children. To address this, the organization could consider partnering with experts in education or conducting focus groups with children to gather feedback on their learning needs.",
    "Accessibility: Another potential problem is ensuring that the organization's programs are accessible to all children, regardless of their ability or background. This may involve adapting materials or methods to accommodate children with special needs, or providing resources such as free or low-cost materials for children from low-income families. To address this, the organization could consider partnering with local schools or organizations that serve children with special needs, or offering free or low-cost materials for all children.",
    "Evaluation and Impact: A fifth potential problem is measuring the effectiveness of the organization's programs and ensuring that they are making a positive impact on children's literacy skills. The organization may need to establish clear goals and metrics for success, and regularly evaluate the effectiveness of its programs. To address this, the organization could consider working with a third-party evaluator or conducting regular assessments of children's literacy skills.",
    "Staffing: A sixth potential problem is recruiting and retaining qualified staff to support the organization's programs. Nonprofit organizations often have limited resources, which can make it difficult to attract and retain top talent. To address this, the organization could consider offering competitive salaries, providing opportunities for professional development, or offering flexible work arrangements."
