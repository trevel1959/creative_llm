You could incorporate different species of cacti into a living wall or vertical garden, using a combination of small pots, wire mesh, and a trellis system. Each cactus could be labeled with its name, origin, and care instructions to educate visitors about these fascinating plants.",
    "**Cactus-based Skincare Products**: Develop a line of skincare products that utilize the natural properties of cacti, known for their high water content and antioxidants.
