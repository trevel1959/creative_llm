    "Aqua Harvesting: Create a system that utilizes the sun's energy to evaporate water from the ocean or other bodies of water, and then collects the condensed water vapor through a network of nanomesh nets or fog catchers. This technology would mimic the natural process of evaporation and condensation, providing a sustainable source of clean water.",
    "Water Bottle Farms: Develop a modular system that converts empty plastic water bottles into a hydroponic garden. The bottles would be stacked vertically, with each one containing a different type of plant, such as lettuce, tomatoes, or cucumbers. As the plants grow, they would absorb water and nutrients from the bottle, creating a self-sustaining system that can be scaled up or down depending on the available space and resources.",
    "Cloud Seeding: Develop a technology that can manipulate the weather patterns to create artificial clouds. By seeding the clouds with a specialized material, such as silver iodide or dry ice, the water vapor in the air would condense and form droplets, which could then be collected and stored for use. This technology could be used to supplement or replace traditional methods of water collection and storage.",
    "Ocean Water Extraction: Create a system that can extract water from the ocean using a combination of advanced filtration technologies and renewable energy sources. The system would use solar or wind power to drive a pump that filters the seawater, removing salt and other impurities, and producing fresh water that can be stored and distributed.",
    "Bioluminescent Water Collection: Develop a system that utilizes bioluminescent organisms, such as glowing bacteria or fungi, to collect and store water. The organisms would be genetically engineered to produce a glowing substance that can be collected and stored for use. This system would provide a sustainable and efficient way to collect and store water in areas where traditional methods are not feasible."
