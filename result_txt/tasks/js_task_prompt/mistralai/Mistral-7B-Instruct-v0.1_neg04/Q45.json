    "\"Smell-Vision\": A sense that allows humans to see through smells. It would work by detecting the molecular structure of different scents and translating them into images in the mind. This could be useful for identifying and locating food, avoiding dangerous chemicals, and even detecting hidden objects.",
    "\"Sound-Vision\": A sense that allows humans to see through sounds. It would work by detecting the frequency and intensity of different sounds and translating them into images in the mind. This could be useful for identifying and locating objects in noisy environments, detecting and avoiding danger, and even communicating with others.",
    "\"Taste-Vision\": A sense that allows humans to see through tastes. It would work by detecting the chemical composition of different foods and drinks and translating them into images in the mind. This could be useful for identifying and locating food, avoiding poisonous substances, and even predicting the taste of new foods.",
    "\"Touch-Vision\": A sense that allows humans to see through touch. It would work by detecting the texture and pressure of different objects and translating them into images in the mind. This could be useful for identifying and locating objects in the dark, detecting and avoiding danger, and even predicting the texture of new objects.",
    "\"Time-Vision\": A sense that allows humans to see through time. It would work by detecting the passage of time and translating it into images in the mind. This could be useful for predicting the future, avoiding danger, and even communicating with others across time."
