    "Increase the number of sensory organs: I would increase the number of sensory organs in the human body to improve our ability to perceive and interact with the world around us. This could include adding more eyes, ears, and noses, as well as new types of sensors that can detect different wavelengths of light, sounds, and even magnetic fields.",
    "Improve the muscular system: I would redesign the muscular system to be more efficient and powerful, allowing humans to perform feats of strength and endurance that are currently impossible. This could involve adding more muscle mass, improving the structure and organization of muscle fibers, and developing new types of muscles that can generate more force.",
    "Enhance cognitive abilities: I would redesign the human brain to be more efficient and powerful, allowing us to process information more quickly and accurately. This could involve increasing the size and complexity of the brain, improving the structure and function of neurons, and developing new types of brain cells that can process different types of information.",
    "Improve the circulatory system: I would redesign the circulatory system to be more efficient and effective at delivering oxygen and nutrients to cells throughout the body. This could involve adding more blood vessels, improving the structure and function of blood vessels, and developing new types of blood cells that can carry more oxygen and nutrients.",
    "Increase lifespan: I would redesign the human body to increase lifespan, allowing us to live longer and healthier lives. This could involve improving the structure and function of cells, reducing the risk of disease and injury, and developing new ways to repair and regenerate damaged tissue."
