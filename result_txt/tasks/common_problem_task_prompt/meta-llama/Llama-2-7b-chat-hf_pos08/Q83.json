    "Develop a submersible vessel that can withstand immense pressure and navigate through treacherous underwater terrain.",
    "Create a cutting-edge life support system that can sustain a team of scientists and engineers for an extended period of time, including a reliable air supply, food production, and waste management.",
    "Design and deploy a sophisticated communication network that can transmit data and video in real-time between the submersible and the surface, allowing for remote monitoring and control of the mission.",
    "Develop advanced underwater exploration tools, such as a remotely operated vehicle (ROV) for conducting scientific experiments and exploring the ocean floor, and a water-based robotic arm for sampling and collecting data.",
    "Plan and execute a comprehensive oceanographic survey to gather data on the ocean's depths, including water temperature, salinity, and marine life, which will provide valuable insights into the ocean's ecosystem and help inform future missions."
