    "Smart Bike Helmet: Develop a bicycle helmet that integrates advanced safety features, such as a rearview camera, GPS, and Bluetooth connectivity. This helmet would provide riders with real-time traffic updates, road conditions, and obstacle detection, ensuring a safer and more convenient cycling experience.",
    "Adaptive Bike Helmet: Create a helmet that can adjust to different head shapes and sizes using a patented adjustable padding system. This feature would provide a customized fit for each rider, ensuring optimal comfort and safety. Additionally, the helmet could include a built-in cooling system, such as ventilation channels or a cooling pad, to keep riders' heads cool during long rides.",
    "Bicycle Helmet with Built-In Lighting: Develop a helmet with integrated LED lights that can be activated when the rider needs additional visibility. The lights could be positioned on the front, rear, or sides of the helmet, providing 360-degree visibility. This feature would be particularly useful for riders who cycle in low-light conditions or at night.",
    "Smart Bike Helmet with Health Monitoring: Create a helmet that tracks the rider's vital signs, such as heart rate, blood oxygen level, and body temperature. This information could be displayed on a small screen integrated into the helmet or transmitted wirelessly to a smartphone app. The helmet could also include features like a built-in music player or a voice assistant, such as Siri or Google Assistant.",
    "Customizable Bike Helmet: Develop a helmet that allows riders to customize its appearance and functionality. Using a modular design, riders could change the color, shape, or features of the helmet to suit their preferences. For example, they could switch between a standard helmet and a full-face helmet, or add features like a face mask or ear protection. This feature would provide riders with a unique and personalized cycling experience."
