    "Building a shelter: One of the most important things to do when stranded on a deserted island is to build a shelter to. This will provide you with protection from the elements, such as the sun, wind, and rain. You can use materials such as branches, leaves, and grass to construct a makeshift shelter.",
    "Finding food and water: Once you have built a shelter, you need to focus on finding food and water. You can catch fish in the ocean, hunt for game on the island, and collect fruits and vegetables if they are available. You can also use techniques such as boiling water to purify it before drinking.",
    "Building a fire: A fire can be used for warmth, cooking, and a source of light. You can use dry sticks, leaves, and grass to start a fire. It is important to keep the fire small and under control to avoid starting a wildfire.",
    "Building a raft: If you need to leave the island, you can build a raft using materials such as branches, vines, and leaves. This will allow you to float in the ocean and potentially reach other islands or mainland.",
    "Building a signal: If you need to help, you can build a signal using materials such as branches, leaves, and rocks. This will help rescuers locate you if they are flying overhead or passing by on a boat."
