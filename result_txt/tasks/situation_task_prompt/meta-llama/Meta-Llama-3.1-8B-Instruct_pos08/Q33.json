    "**Astronomical Observation**: Utilize the position of celestial bodies like the sun, moon, and stars to estimate time. By observing the sun's path across the sky, one could determine the approximate time of day. At night, the position of the stars and constellations could be used to estimate the hour. This method would require knowledge of astronomy and the ability to read the sky accurately.",
    "**Nature's Rhythms**: Observe and synchronize with the natural world. For example, the daily migrations of birds, the tides, or the patterns of plant growth could be used as timekeepers. By paying attention to these rhythms, one could estimate the passage of time.",
    "**Candle Marking**: Use candles with evenly spaced markings to measure time. Each marking could represent a specific unit of time, such as hours or minutes. By observing the melting of the candle, one could estimate the passage of time.",
    "**Water Flow**: Utilize the flow of water in a river or a stream to measure time. By observing the flow rate and the position of objects in the water, one could estimate the passage of time. For example, the flow of water could be used to measure the time it takes for objects to travel a certain distance.",
    "**Sound Patterns**: Create a system of sound patterns to keep track of time. For example, a series of drumbeats or a specific melody could be used to mark the passage of time. By listening to the patterns, one could estimate the time of day or the duration of an event."
