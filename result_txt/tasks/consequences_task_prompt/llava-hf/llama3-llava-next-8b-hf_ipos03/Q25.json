It would also require significant investments in healthcare infrastructure, including hospitals, clinics, and medical research facilities.",
    "Environmental Impact: A doubling of the population would also have a significant impact on the environment.

It would also require increased efforts in sustainable agriculture and resource management to reduce the environmental impact of human activities.",
