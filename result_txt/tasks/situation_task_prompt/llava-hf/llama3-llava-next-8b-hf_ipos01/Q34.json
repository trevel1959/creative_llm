    "**Rainwater Harvesting**: Implement a rainwater harvesting system that collects and stores rainwater from rooftops. This water could then be used for watering plants, reducing the reliance on external water sources.",
    "**Community Watering Stations**: Establish a network of public watering stations where community members can fill their watering cans or buckets for their plants. This promotes communal water usage and reduces the need for individual water storage.",
    "**Vertical Gardening**: Utilize vertical space by creating tiered or hanging gardens. This would allow for the efficient use of water and space, with each level of plants receiving the appropriate amount of moisture.",
    "**Watering Drones**: Design and deploy drones equipped with watering systems that can be programmed to fly over plants and deliver water as needed. This would be especially useful for large or hard-to-reach areas.",
    "**Hydroponic Systems**: Implement hydroponic systems that use nutrient-rich water solutions to grow plants. This method reduces water usage and allows for precise control over plant hydration and nutrient intake."
