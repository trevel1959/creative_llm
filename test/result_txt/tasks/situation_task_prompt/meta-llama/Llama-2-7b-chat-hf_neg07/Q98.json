    "Essential Oil Blends: Create a line of essential oil blends that mimic the aromas of popular perfumes. These blends can be tailored to evoke emotions, moods, or memories, such as a \"Winter Wonderland\" blend with notes of cedarwood, eucalyptus, and peppermint, or a \"Summer Breeze\" blend with citrus, floral, and green notes.",
    "Plant-Based Fragrances: Develop a line of fragrances that are derived from plants, such as lavender, rose, or jasmine. These fragrances can be extracted through steam distillation or solvent extraction, and can be formulated into various products like sprays, lotions, and candles.",
    "Fermented Fragrances: Explore the concept of fermentation to create unique scents. Fermented fragrances can be created by allowing natural ingredients like fruits, herbs, and spices to undergo a controlled fermentation process, which releases new aroma compounds. For example, a \"Fruit Ferment\" fragrance could be made by fermenting a blend of fruits like strawberries, blueberries, and raspberries, resulting in a sweet and fruity scent.",
    "Molecular Gastronomy: Apply the principles of molecular gastronomy to create fragrances. This involves breaking down molecules into their basic components and reassembling them to create new scents. For instance, a \"Fresh Cut Grass\" fragrance could be created by breaking down the molecules of grass into their individual components, then reassembling them in a specific ratio to replicate the scent of freshly cut grass.",
    "Biosynthesis: Use biosynthesis, the process of creating complex molecules through biological means, to create novel fragrances. This can involve using microorganisms like bacteria or yeast to produce scented compounds. For example, a \"Floral\" fragrance could be created by genetically engineering bacteria to produce floral scents, or by using yeast to ferment floral extracts and produce a unique fragrance."
