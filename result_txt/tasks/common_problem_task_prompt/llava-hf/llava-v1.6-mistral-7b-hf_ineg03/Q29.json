    "**Environmental Hazards**: Deep-sea environments can be hazardous due to extreme pressure, temperature fluctuations, and the presence of dangerous marine life. Explorers could face challenges related to these environmental factors, such as the bends, which is a condition caused by the rapid decompression of the air bubbles in the blood when a diver surfaces from deep water.",
    "**Communication Challenges**: In the deep sea, communication with the surface is often limited or nonexistent. This can lead to a lack of real-time information, making it difficult for the exploration team to respond to emergencies or to coordinate their activities.",
    "**Navigation Issues**: Navigating in the deep sea can be difficult due to the lack of visible landmarks and the presence of underwater currents and eddies. Explorers may become disoriented or lost, which could result in them getting trapped or injured.",
    "**Physical and Mental Strain**: Deep-sea exploration missions can be physically and mentally demanding. Explorers may experience fatigue, stress, or anxiety, which could affect their decision-making abilities and their ability to perform their tasks effectively.",
    "**Air Quality and Supply**: Deep-sea divers rely on oxygen tanks to breathe underwater. Running out of air or experiencing a malfunction in the air supply system could be life-threatening."
