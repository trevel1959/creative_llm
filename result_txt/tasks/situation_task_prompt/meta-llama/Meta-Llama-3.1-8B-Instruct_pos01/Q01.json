    "**The Universal Postal System**: Establish a network of physical postal services that use a combination of traditional mail, bicycles, and horseback riding to deliver messages across countries. Each message would be encoded with a unique identifier and a system of stamps and postal codes would be used to track the delivery process. (Confidence score: 0.8)",
    "**The Human Carrier Network**: Create a network of volunteer \"messengers\" who would travel between countries on foot, by bicycle, or by horseback, carrying messages from one person to another. This network would rely on a system of trusted messengers and a network of safe houses to ensure the safe passage of messages. (Confidence score: 0.7)",
    "**The Solar-Powered Message Beacon**: Develop a system of solar-powered message beacons that would transmit messages through a combination of mirrors and lenses, using the sun's energy to power the transmission process. These beacons would be placed in strategic locations around the world, allowing messages to be transmitted over long distances. (Confidence score: 0.9)",
    "**The International Smoke Signal**: Establish a system of smoke signals that would be used to transmit messages between countries. A complex system of smoke signals would be developed, using different colors and patterns to convey different messages. This system would rely on a network of observers who would watch for the smoke signals and relay the messages to the intended recipient. (Confidence score: 0.6)",
    "**The Global Homing Pigeon Network**: Create a network of homing pigeons that would be trained to carry messages between countries. Each pigeon would be equipped with a small container attached to its leg, containing the message to be delivered.
