    "A starfish with legs - The starfish could have developed legs over time to adapt to its environment. The legs could be strong and sturdy, allowing the starfish to move around on land with ease. The starfish could also use its legs to climb up rocks or navigate through dense vegetation.",
    "A starfish with a special exoskeleton - The starfish could have developed an exoskeleton that is specifically designed for walking on land. The exoskeleton could be lightweight and flexible, allowing the starfish to move quickly and easily on land. The exoskeleton could also provide protection for the starfish's soft body parts.",
    "A starfish with a jet propulsion system - The starfish could have developed a jet propulsion system that allows it to move quickly and efficiently on land. The system could involve a series of muscles that contract and relax to create a powerful jet of water that propels the starfish forward. This would allow the starfish to move quickly and easily over long distances.",
    "A starfish with a suction cup foot - The starfish could have developed a special foot that is covered in suction cups. The suction cups could allow the starfish to stick to surfaces on land, allowing it to move around easily without sinking or sliding. The starfish could also use its suction cups to climb up steep surfaces or navigate through narrow crevices.",
    "A starfish with a magnetic field - The starfish could have developed a magnetic field that allows it to move around on land with ease. The magnetic field could repel or attract other objects, allowing the starfish to move around without touching the ground. This would allow the starfish to move quickly and easily over long distances without getting tired or losing its footing."
