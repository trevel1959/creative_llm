    "Weather conditions: Organic farming relies heavily on natural weather conditions, such as sunlight, rainfall, and temperature. Unpredictable weather can impact crop yields and farm operations, leading to potential financial losses and difficulties in meeting the farm's objectives.",
    "Pest control: Organic farming typically avoids the use of synthetic pesticides, which can make controlling pests more challenging. Farmers may need to rely on alternative methods, such as crop rotation, natural predators, or organic pesticides, to protect their crops from pests.",
    "Soil quality: Maintaining good soil quality is crucial for organic farming, as it supports the growth of healthy crops. Farmers need to manage their land effectively, ensuring that the soil is not depleted or degraded, and that it retains essential nutrients for crop growth.",
    "Labor costs: Organic farming often requires manual labor, such as planting, weeding, and harvesting. Labor costs can be a significant expense for farmers, and finding skilled workers to manage the farm can be challenging, especially in rural areas.",
    "Market demand: The demand for organic produce can be unpredictable, making it challenging for farmers to predict and meet their market needs. Fluctuating market prices and limited demand can impact the farm's financial stability."
