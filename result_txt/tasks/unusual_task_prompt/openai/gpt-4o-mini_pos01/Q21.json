    "**Garden Decor**: Repurpose old mirrors as decorative elements in your garden. Hang them on trees or fences to create an illusion of depth and space. This not only adds visual interest but can also reflect sunlight to help certain plants thrive. The reflections can also attract butterflies and other wildlife, enhancing the natural beauty of your garden.",
    "**Artistic Canvas**: Use a mirror as a canvas for art. Instead of traditional painting surfaces, create designs using glass markers or special paint designed for mirrors. This unique approach allows for the creation of artwork that can be easily changed or updated, as it can be wiped clean and redone whenever desired.",
    "**DIY Photo Booth**: Set up a mirror as a fun and interactive photo booth at events. By placing a camera behind the mirror and adding fun props around it, guests can take playful selfies. The mirror adds a unique twist, as people will see their reflections in a creative way while capturing memories.",
    "**Sound Amplifier**: Use a large mirror as a makeshift sound amplifier for music or speeches. By placing a speaker in front of the mirror, the sound waves can bounce off the surface, creating a fuller and richer audio experience. This can be especially useful for outdoor gatherings or in spaces where sound tends to dissipate.",
    "**Interactive Learning Tool**: In educational settings, mirrors can be used as interactive tools for teaching concepts such as symmetry, angles, and reflections. Students can draw shapes or patterns on paper and then use mirrors to explore how those shapes look when reflected, making learning more engaging and hands-on."
