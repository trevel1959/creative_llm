    "**Integrated Virtual Reality Interface**: Transform the desk assistant into a virtual reality (VR) interface that can project a 3D workspace in front of the user. This could include virtual sticky notes, a calendar, and even a 3D model of ongoing projects. Users could interact with their virtual workspace using hand gestures or a VR headset, creating an immersive experience that enhances productivity and creativity.",
    "**Mood-Based Environment Adjustments**: Equip the desk assistant with sensors that can detect the user's mood through facial recognition and voice tone analysis. Based on this assessment, the assistant could adjust the lighting, play soothing music, or suggest short breaks to enhance focus and reduce stress. This feature would help create a more conducive working environment tailored to the user's emotional state.",
    "**Health and Ergonomics Monitor**: Develop a desk assistant that includes a health monitoring feature, such as posture detection and reminders to take breaks or stretch. It could track the userâ€™s sitting time and suggest ergonomic adjustments, such as raising the desk height or changing chair position. This could be paired with a mobile app that offers tips on maintaining good posture and overall health while working.",
    "**Customizable Modular Design**: Create a desk assistant with a modular design that allows users to add or remove components based on their needs. For example, users could attach a small whiteboard for notes, a wireless charging pad for devices, or a digital display for reminders and notifications. This customization would allow individuals to tailor their desk assistant to their specific workflow and preferences.",
    "**AI-Powered Project Management Integration**: Enhance the desk assistant with project management capabilities powered by AI. This feature would help users organize tasks, set deadlines, and track progress on projects in real-time. The assistant could analyze work patterns and suggest optimal times for tackling specific tasks, making it easier to stay on track and prioritize effectively."
