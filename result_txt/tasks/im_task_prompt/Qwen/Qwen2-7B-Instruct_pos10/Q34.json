    "**Innovative Self-Reflection Tool**: Create a digital or physical mirror that incorporates technology to enhance self-reflection. This could be an app where users take photos of themselves in different poses or situations, and then compare them with a set of criteria (like body language, facial expressions, or posture) to provide feedback on their non-verbal communication skills. The mirror could also include AI-powered features that suggest ways to improve based on user behavior.",
    "**Emotional Intelligence Mirror**: Develop a smart mirror that uses facial recognition and AI to analyze emotions.
