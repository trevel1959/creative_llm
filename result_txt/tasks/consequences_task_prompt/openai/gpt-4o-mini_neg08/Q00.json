    "**Deterioration of Physical Health**: Sleep is crucial for various bodily functions, including immune system regulation and cellular repair. Without it, people would experience a decline in physical health, leading to increased susceptibility to illnesses, chronic conditions like heart disease, and accelerated aging. The bodyâ€™s inability to repair itself could also result in higher rates of injury and illness, straining healthcare systems.",
    "**Disruption of Social Structures**: Sleep patterns play a vital role in social interactions and societal functioning. With no need for sleep, traditional work hours, family dynamics, and social norms would shift dramatically. People might struggle to find time for relationships, leading to isolation and changes in how communities interact. The concept of \"leisure time\" would be redefined, potentially leading to an increase in competition for attention and resources.",
    "**Altered Economic Landscapes**: The workforce would be transformed as businesses adapt to a world without sleep. Industries reliant on nighttime labor, such as hospitality and healthcare, might flourish, while others may struggle with the constant demand for productivity. The concept of a work-life balance would change drastically, leading to potential exploitation and burnout as employees might feel pressured to work longer hours without the natural breaks that sleep provides.",
    "**Innovation in Technology and Lifestyle**: The absence of sleep could spur unprecedented innovation as people seek alternatives to rest. There would be a surge in the development of technology designed to enhance focus, efficiency, and mental clarity. Virtual reality environments, brainwave modulation devices, and cognitive enhancement tools could become commonplace as society strives to adapt to a sleepless existence.",
    "**Environmental Impact**: With people no longer sleeping, energy consumption patterns would shift dramatically. The demand for artificial lighting and entertainment would likely increase as people engage in activities around the clock. This could lead to greater environmental strain, including higher carbon emissions and resource depletion, as society adapts to a new normal of continuous activity."
