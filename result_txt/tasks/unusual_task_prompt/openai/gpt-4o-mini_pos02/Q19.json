    "**Scented Drawer Freshener**: Instead of using commercial air fresheners, place a small candle in your drawers or closets. The candle will slowly release its fragrance, keeping your clothes smelling fresh without the risk of staining fabric, as long as the candle remains unlit.",
    "**DIY Oil Lamp**: If you find yourself without electricity, you can convert a candle into an oil lamp. Melt the wax down and mix it with a small amount of vegetable oil. Place a wick in the mixture, and you have a homemade oil lamp that can provide light during power outages.",
    "**Wound Healing Tool**: The wax from a candle can be used to create a makeshift splint for minor injuries. Melt the wax and pour it over a piece of cloth to create a flexible, protective covering for a sprained wrist or finger. The warmth of the wax can also provide soothing relief to sore muscles when applied as a warm compress.",
    "**Creative Painting Tool**: Use the side of a lit candle to create unique textures in your artwork. The wax can be used to resist paint on canvas or paper, creating interesting patterns when you apply paint over it. Once the paint dries, you can scrape off the wax to reveal the design underneath.",
