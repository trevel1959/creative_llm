    "Invent a mechanical pollinator: Develop a machine that can mimic the movements of pollinators such as bees and butterflies. The machine can be programmed to move from flower to flower, collecting pollen and spreading it to other plants.",
    "Use wind and water: Use wind and water to pollinate plants. This can be done by creating a system that blows pollen from one plant to another or by using a water source to carry pollen from one plant to another.",
    "Use pollen from other plants: Collect pollen from other plants that are not affected by the disappearance of flowers. This pollen can then be used to pollinate the affected plants.",
    "Use genetic engineering: Use genetic engineering to create plants that are self-pollinating. This can be done by inserting genes into the plants that allow them to pollinate themselves.",
    "Use a combination of methods: Use a combination of the above methods to pollinate plants. For example, use a mechanical pollinator to collect pollen and then use wind and water to spread it to other plants."
