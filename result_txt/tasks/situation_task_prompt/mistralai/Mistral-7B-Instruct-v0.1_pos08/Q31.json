    "I would explore new hobbies and interests: If all sources of entertainment disappeared, I would have to find new ways to entertain myself. This could mean trying out new hobbies and interests that I've never had time for before. I could learn to play a musical instrument, take up painting, or try out a new sport. These new activities would provide me with a sense of accomplishment and fulfillment, and would also help me to discover new passions.",
    "I would spend more time with family and friends: Without entertainment, I would have more time to spend with the people I care about. I could plan fun outings, game nights, or movie nights with my loved ones. This would help me to strengthen my relationships and create lasting memories.",
    "I would learn a new language: Learning a new language is a challenging and rewarding experience. I could use my newfound free time to learn a new language, either through online courses or in-person classes. This would help me to expand my knowledge and improve my cognitive abilities.",
    "I would volunteer: Volunteering is a great way to give back to the community and make a positive impact. I could use my free time to volunteer at a local organization, such as a shelter, food bank, or animal rescue. This would help me to feel more connected to my community and make a difference in the lives of others.",
    "I would explore nature: Nature is a great source of entertainment and inspiration. I could use my free time to hike, bike, or explore local parks and natural areas. This would help me to connect with the natural world and improve my physical and mental health."
