    "Underwater Cities: If the ocean levels rose drastically, I would move to an underwater city. Underwater cities are becoming increasingly popular and offer a unique living experience. They are designed to withstand the pressures of the ocean and provide a sustainable living environment.",
    "Floating Homes: Another option would be to move to a floating home. Floating homes are built on boats and can be moved to different locations as needed. They offer a sense of freedom and the ability to live on the water.",
    "Eco-Friendly Communities: I would also consider living in an eco-friendly community. These communities are designed to be sustainable and have a minimal impact on the environment. They often feature renewable energy sources, green spaces, and a focus on community building.",
    "Coastal Cities: If the ocean levels rise, coastal cities may become uninhabitable. However, there may still be some coastal cities that are able to adapt and continue to thrive. I would consider living in one of these cities, as they offer a unique blend of urban and coastal living.",
    "High-Tech Homes: Finally, I would consider living in a high-tech home that is designed to withstand the pressures of the ocean. These homes often feature advanced technology and materials that make them more resistant to flooding and other natural disasters. They offer a sense of security and the ability to live in a modern, comfortable environment."
