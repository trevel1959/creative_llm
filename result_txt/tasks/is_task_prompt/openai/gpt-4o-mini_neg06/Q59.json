Together, they practiced floating higher, inch by inch. With each ascent, Nimbus discovered breathtaking views and the joy of freedom. Finally, he soared to the highest heights, realizing that fear was merely a barrier to beauty. From that day on, Nimbus became the bravest cloud, inspiring others to conquer their fears.",

Nimbus realized that the view was worth the fear, and he laughed with delight, embracing the heights he once dreaded, becoming a beacon of courage for other clouds.",
