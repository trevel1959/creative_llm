    "Pedal-powered transportation pods: Imagine a futuristic pod that can accommodate multiple people, powered by pedaling on a built-in stationary bike. The pod could have a sleek design, with comfortable seating and ample storage space for cargo. This mode of transportation would not only be eco-friendly but also provide a great workout for those who enjoy cycling.",
    "Personal air-propulsion devices: Picture a small, wearable device that can be strapped to your body, similar to a backpack. This device would use a combination of fan technology and air pressure to propel the user forward, creating a smooth and efficient mode of transportation. This innovative solution would eliminate the need for a car and provide a fun, active way to get around.",
    "Hover-bikes: Envision a revolutionary new mode of transportation that combines the best of both worlds - the efficiency of a bike and the thrill of flying. Hover-bikes would use advanced magnet technology to create a cushion of air around the bike, allowing it to hover above the ground. This would eliminate the need for roads and traffic, providing a smooth and exhilarating ride.",
    "Personal submarines: Imagine a personal underwater vehicle that can be used for transportation in urban areas. These submarines could be powered by electricity or even solar energy, making them eco-friendly and quiet. They could also be equipped with advanced navigation systems, allowing for easy navigation through crowded waterways.",
    "Magnetic levitation trains: Picture a train system that uses magnetic levitation technology to propel trains at high speeds without touching the ground. This futuristic mode of transportation would be completely frictionless, reducing travel time and eliminating the need for fuel. The trains could be powered by electricity or even solar energy, making them a sustainable and efficient way to get around without a car."
