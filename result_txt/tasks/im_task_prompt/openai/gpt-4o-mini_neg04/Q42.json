    "**Modular Design with Expandable Compartments**: Create a suitcase with a modular design that allows travelers to add or remove compartments based on their needs. For instance, if someone is going on a short trip, they can detach extra compartments to make the suitcase lighter and more compact. Conversely, for longer trips, they can add compartments to accommodate more items, allowing for greater flexibility and organization.",
    "**Integrated Power Bank and Wireless Charging**: Equip the suitcase with a built-in power bank that includes multiple USB ports for charging devices on the go. Additionally, add a wireless charging pad on the top of the suitcase for smartphones. This ensures that travelers can keep their devices charged without needing to search for power outlets at airports or during layovers.",
    "**Self-Weighing Technology**: Integrate a digital scale into the suitcase that automatically weighs the luggage when it is closed. The suitcase can display the weight on a small screen, or sync with a mobile app to notify the user if they are approaching the airlineâ€™s weight limit. This feature helps travelers avoid unexpected fees and makes packing more efficient.",
    "**Built-in Clothing Steamer**: Design a suitcase with a compact, built-in clothing steamer that can be activated with the press of a button. This would allow travelers to freshen up wrinkled clothes without needing to find an iron or a steamer at their destination. The steamer could use a refillable water tank, making it easy to use while on the road.",
    "**Eco-Friendly Materials and Design**: Develop a suitcase made from sustainable materials, such as recycled plastics or biodegradable fabrics. The suitcase could also feature a repairable design, allowing travelers to replace parts instead of discarding the entire suitcase when it gets damaged. This eco-conscious approach appeals to environmentally aware consumers and reduces waste."
