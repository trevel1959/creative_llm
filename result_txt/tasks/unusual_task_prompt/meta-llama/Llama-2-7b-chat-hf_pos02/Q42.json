    "Smart Gloves for Virtual Reality: Create a pair of gloves with sensors and actuators embedded in the fingers, allowing users to interact with virtual objects in a more realistic way. The sensors could detect hand movements and transmit them to the virtual environment, while the actuators could provide haptic feedback to simulate the feel of touching virtual objects.",
    "Glove-based Brain-Computer Interface: Develop a glove with electroencephalography (EEG) sensors that can read brain signals and translate them into digital commands. This could enable people with paralysis or other motor disorders to control electronic devices with their thoughts.",
    "Smart Gloves for Athletes: Create a pair of gloves with sensors that can track an athlete's hand movements during training or competition. The sensors could provide real-time feedback on technique, allowing athletes to improve their performance and reduce the risk of injury.",
    "Glove-based Gaming Controller: Develop a glove with buttons, joysticks, or other controls that can be used to control video games. The glove could be worn on both hands, allowing for more complex and immersive gameplay experiences.",
    "Wearable Glove for People with Disabilities: Create a glove that can help people with disabilities, such as those with spinal cord injuries or muscular dystrophy, to perform daily tasks more easily. The glove could have sensors that detect the user's hand movements and translate them into digital commands, allowing them to control electronic devices such as smartphones or computers with greater ease."
