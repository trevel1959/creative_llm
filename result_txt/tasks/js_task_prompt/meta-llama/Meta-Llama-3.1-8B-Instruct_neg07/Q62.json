Sonderwave would be a powerful, resonant emotion that makes you feel the interconnectedness of humanity.",
    "**Nimbus**: A whimsical, dreamlike emotion that arises when you're surrounded by the soft, gentle textures of nature – think clouds, mist, or the delicate petals of a flower. Imagine walking through a serene forest, feeling the soft caress of leaves and the gentle rustle of branches, and suddenly feeling as though you're floating on a cloud. Nimbus would be a soothing, ethereal emotion that makes you feel weightless and free. [/"
