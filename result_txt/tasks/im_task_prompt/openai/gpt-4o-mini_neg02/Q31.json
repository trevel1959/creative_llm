    "**Modular Design with Interchangeable Components**: Create a camera with a modular design where users can easily swap out lenses, sensors, and even battery packs. This would allow photographers to customize their camera for different shooting scenarios, such as wildlife photography, astrophotography, or street photography. Additionally, it could encourage sustainability by allowing users to upgrade individual parts rather than replacing the entire camera.",
    "**Augmented Reality (AR) Viewfinder**: Integrate AR technology into the camera's viewfinder or screen. This feature could overlay useful information, such as composition guidelines, real-time histogram data, and grid lines, directly onto the live view. It could also offer virtual framing options or suggest angles based on the scene being captured, helping photographers to visualize and compose their shots more effectively.",
    "**Built-in Social Media Integration**: Develop a camera that seamlessly connects to social media platforms. Users could instantly edit and share their photos with built-in filters and editing tools, all within the camera interface. Additionally, the camera could offer features like live streaming directly to platforms, making it easier for content creators to engage with their audience in real-time.",
    "**Eco-Friendly Design with Solar Charging**: Design a camera that incorporates solar panels into its body, allowing it to charge using sunlight. This eco-friendly feature would be especially beneficial for outdoor photographers who spend long hours in nature. Coupled with a lightweight and durable design, this would make the camera ideal for adventures, reducing reliance on traditional power sources.",
    "**Voice Command Functionality**: Implement voice recognition technology that allows users to control the camera hands-free. Photographers could adjust settings, take photos, or start/stop video recording simply by speaking commands. This would be particularly useful in situations where the photographer is unable to physically reach the camera, such as when using a tripod or when capturing wildlife."
