    "Widespread Transportation Disruptions: With insufficient oil supply, the transportation sector, including cars, trucks, and airplanes, would be severely affected. The world would need to transition to alternative, cleaner energy sources, such as electric vehicles and public transportation. This would require significant investments in infrastructure and a complete overhaul of the transportation system.",
    "Environmental Benefits: While a sudden end to oil usage would have short-term negative consequences, it could have long-term environmental benefits. The reduction in greenhouse gas emissions, primarily carbon dioxide, would help combat climate change. Air quality would improve, and wildlife habitats that have been damaged by oil spills, drilling, and transportation of oil would recover.",
    "Technological Advancements: The need for alternative energy sources would lead to rapid technological innovations, fostering sustainable industries like renewable energy, nuclear energy, and advanced energy storage solutions. This would create new job opportunities and spur economic growth.",
    "Shift in Resource Management: A world without oil would necessitate a rethinking of resource management and global trade. Countries with abundant renewable energy sources would have an advantage, and those reliant on oil would need to diversify their energy portfolios. This could lead to a shift in power dynamics within nations and between countries.",
    "Food Security Concerns: The oil industry also plays a role in agricultural practices, such as fuel for farm machinery and fertilizers. In the absence of oil, farming methods would need to shift toward sustainable, organic farming techniques that do not rely on oil-based fertilizers. This could impact global food security, as many modern agricultural practices are heavily dependent on fossil fuels."
