    "Create a garden filled with sunflowers that are designed to smile back at people as they pass by. This could be done by using a special type of sunflower seed that has been genetically modified to produce flowers with faces. The flowers could be painted with bright colors and have a friendly expression that makes people feel happy and welcome.",
    "Create a mobile app that uses augmented reality to superimpose a smiling sunflower onto the user's surroundings. The app could be used to take photos or videos of the sunflower and share them on social media, creating a virtual garden of happy sunflowers.",
    "Create a scented candle that smells like a sunflower field. The candle could be designed to look like a sunflower, with a yellow flower head and green leaves. When the candle is lit, it could release a fragrance that is reminiscent of a sunny day in a field of sunflowers.",
    "Create a line of sunflower-based skincare products. The products could be made from natural ingredients such as sunflower oil and beeswax, and could be designed to nourish and protect the skin. The packaging could feature sunflower images and a cheerful color palette to make the products feel happy and refreshing.",
    "Create a virtual reality experience that transports users to a sunflower field. The experience could be designed to feel like a real-life sunflower field, with a 360-degree view of the sunflowers and a soundtrack of birds chirping and rustling leaves.
