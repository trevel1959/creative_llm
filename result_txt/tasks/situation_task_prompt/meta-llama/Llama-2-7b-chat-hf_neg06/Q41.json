    "Nature-Inspired Decor: With all paint gone, you could turn to nature for inspiration. Use natural materials like branches, rocks, and shells to create unique decorative elements. For example, you could create a branch mobile or a rock sculpture to add some texture and depth to your walls. You could also use shells to create a mosaic or a pattern on your floors.",
    "Light Installations: Since paint is no longer an option, you could focus on creating light installations to add color and interest to your space. You could use LED lights, glowing orbs, or even neon signs to create a visually striking display. You could also experiment with mirrors and reflective surfaces to bounce light around the room and create an immersive experience.",
    "Textile-Based Decor: With paint gone, you could turn to textiles to add color and pattern to your space. Use a combination of fabrics like wool, cotton, and silk to create tapestries, wall hangings, or even upholstery. You could also experiment with embroidery, appliqu√©, or other textile techniques to add intricate details and designs to your decor.",
    "3D Printed Decor: If you have access to a 3D printer, you could use it to create unique decorative elements.

    "Natural Dye Decor: If you want to stick to natural materials, you could use natural dyes to create colorful decorative elements.
