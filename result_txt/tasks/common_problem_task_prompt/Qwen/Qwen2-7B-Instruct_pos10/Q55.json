This could include workshops for teaching sustainable farming techniques, tree planting events, and awareness campaigns about the importance of preserving natural habitats. This not only boosts community participation but also helps in the long-term sustainability of the park.",
    "**Research and Education Center**: Establish a center within the park that focuses on wildlife research, biodiversity studies, and environmental education. This center could host researchers, scientists, and students from around the world, fostering international collaboration and knowledge exchange. Public lectures, guided tours, and interactive exhibits could educate visitors about the significance of conservation efforts.",
    "**Sustainable Energy Solutions**: Implement innovative energy solutions within the park such as solar panels, wind turbines, and rainwater harvesting systems. This not only reduces the carbon footprint of the park but also serves as a model for sustainable living for both the park's visitors and the surrounding communities.",
    "**Wildlife Rehabilitation and Release Program**: Set up a facility within the park dedicated to the rehabilitation of injured or orphaned wildlife.
