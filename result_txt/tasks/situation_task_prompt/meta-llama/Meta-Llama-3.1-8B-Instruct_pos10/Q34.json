    "**Hydroponic System**: I'd set up an indoor hydroponic system where plants are suspended in a nutrient-rich solution rather than soil. This would allow me to control the water levels and provide the necessary nutrients for the plants to thrive. The system would be designed with a self-sustaining mechanism, using a water reservoir, pump, and aeration system to maintain optimal conditions.",
    "**Atmospheric Water Harvester**: I'd invest in an atmospheric water harvester, which extracts water from the air using a condensation process. This device would be connected to a drip irrigation system, providing a steady supply of water to the plants. The harvester would be powered by a renewable energy source, such as solar or wind energy.",
    "**Rainwater Collection System**: I'd design and install a rainwater collection system that captures and stores rainwater for irrigation purposes. The system would consist of a network of gutters, downspouts, and storage tanks. The collected rainwater would be filtered and treated before being used to water the plants.",
    "**Aquaponic System**: I'd create an aquaponic system, which combines hydroponics with aquaculture. This system would involve raising fish or other aquatic animals in tanks, and using their waste as a nutrient-rich fertilizer for the plants. The plants would be grown in a hydroponic system, and the water from the fish tanks would be pumped into the plant system, creating a closed-loop ecosystem.",
    "**Fog Collector**: I'd install a fog collector, which uses a mesh screen to capture fog droplets and condense them into water. The collected water would be stored in a tank and used for irrigation purposes. The fog collector would be designed to work in areas with high fog frequencies, providing a reliable source of water for the plants."
