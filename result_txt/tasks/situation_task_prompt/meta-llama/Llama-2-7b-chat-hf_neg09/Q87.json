    "Use of laser cutters: With the disappearance of scissors and knives, people could turn to laser cutters as an alternative for cutting various materials. Laser cutters use a high-powered laser beam to cut through materials with precision and accuracy, making them an ideal substitute for scissors and knives.",
    "Utilize water as a cutting tool: Water can be used as a cutting tool in various situations. For example, people could use a stream of water from a hose or a water jet cutter to cut through materials like plastic, metal, or even stone. This method would be particularly useful for cutting large or heavy objects that are difficult to maneuver with traditional cutting tools.",
    "Develop new types of blades: With the absence of scissors and knives, researchers and inventors could focus on creating new types of blades that can perform similar functions. For instance, they could develop blades made of advanced materials like diamond or graphene, which would be able to cut through materials with unprecedented precision and durability.",
    "Harness the power of sound waves: Scientists could explore the possibility of using sound waves to cut through materials. By generating high-frequency sound waves, they could create a cutting action that can slice through various materials, including metals, plastics, and even stone. This technology could revolutionize the way we cut and shape materials in various industries.",
    "Use of magnetic fields: In a world without scissors or knives, people could harness the power of magnetic fields to cut through materials. By creating strong magnetic fields, they could manipulate the molecules of a material and cut through it without causing any damage. This technology could have numerous applications in various industries, from medical to industrial manufacturing."
