    "**Ergonomic Design with Adjustable Handle**: Redesign the watering can with an ergonomic handle that can be adjusted for different grip styles and heights. This would cater to various users, including children and the elderly, making it more comfortable to use. The handle could also have a non-slip grip material to enhance usability, especially when wet.",
    "**Integrated Water Filter System**: Incorporate a simple water filtration system within the watering can. This system could use a replaceable filter that removes impurities and chlorine from tap water, ensuring that plants receive clean water. This would be especially beneficial for indoor plants that are sensitive to chemicals in regular tap water.",
    "**Color-Coded Measurement System**: Add a color-coded measurement system on the side of the watering can to help users gauge how much water they are pouring. Different colors could represent different amounts (e.g., blue for 1 cup, green for 2 cups, etc.), making it easier for gardeners to provide precise amounts of water for different plants.",
    "**Built-in Plant Nutrient Dispenser**: Design a watering can that includes a compartment for plant nutrients or fertilizers. Users can fill this compartment with their preferred nutrients, and as they water their plants, the can will automatically dispense a measured amount of nutrients along with the water. This feature would simplify the process of fertilizing plants while ensuring they receive the necessary nutrients.",
    "**Collapsible and Portable Design**: Create a collapsible watering can that can be easily folded down for storage or travel. This design would be particularly useful for gardeners with limited space or those who like to take their gardening supplies on the go, such as camping or traveling. The material could be durable yet lightweight, ensuring it maintains its shape when in use."
