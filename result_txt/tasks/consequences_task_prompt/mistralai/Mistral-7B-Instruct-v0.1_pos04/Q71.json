    "If we discovered immortality, it could have a profound impact on our society and culture. People may start to value life differently, and there could be a shift in the way we approach death and the afterlife.",
    "The discovery of immortality could lead to a population boom, as people would have the ability to live much longer and reproduce at a higher rate. This could strain resources and lead to overpopulation.",
    "Immortality could also lead to a lack of progress, as people may no longer feel the need to innovate or explore new things since they could simply live forever.",
    "There could be a significant impact on mental health, as people may struggle with the idea of living forever and the weight of their own mortality being lifted.",
    "Immortality could lead to a lack of diversity, as people may become more homogenous over time and the genetic diversity of the population could decrease."
