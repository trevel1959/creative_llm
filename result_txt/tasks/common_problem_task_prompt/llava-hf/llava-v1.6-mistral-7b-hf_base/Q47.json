    "Problem: Lack of Technical Knowledge: Building a computer from scratch requires a certain level of technical knowledge. If the person building the computer is not familiar with the process or the components, they may face difficulties in assembling the computer correctly, leading to potential problems or damage to the components.",
    "Problem: Insufficient Space: The person building the computer may face difficulties in finding enough space to build the computer, especially if they are using a small desk or a cramped workspace. This can make it difficult to properly assemble and connect the components, leading to potential issues.",
    "Problem: Dust and Dirt: The computer components are sensitive to dust and dirt, which can cause overheating and damage the components over time. The person building the computer must take measures to keep the workspace clean and free of dust and debris.",
    "Problem: Electrical Issues: Building a computer from scratch requires a power supply to provide electricity to the components. If the power supply is not correctly connected or if there are electrical issues in the workspace, it can cause damage to the components or even pose a fire hazard.",
    "Problem: Cost: Building a computer from scratch can be expensive, especially if the person is purchasing high-end components. The cost of the components may be prohibitive for some people, making it difficult to complete the project."
