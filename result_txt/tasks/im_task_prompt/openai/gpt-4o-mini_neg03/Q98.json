    "**Self-Cleaning Mechanism**: Introduce a self-cleaning feature that uses steam and high-pressure water jets to clean the juicer's components after use. This would eliminate the hassle of disassembling and scrubbing parts, making the juicing process more convenient and encouraging more frequent use. Users could simply press a button, and the juicer would handle the cleanup automatically.",
    "**Multi-Functional Juicer**: Create a juicer that can also function as a blender, food processor, and ice crusher. By adding interchangeable attachments, users can make smoothies, soups, sauces, and even crushed ice for cocktails, all with one appliance. This would save space in the kitchen and provide versatility for users who enjoy various food and drink preparations.",
    "**Juice Preservation Technology**: Implement a system that uses vacuum sealing and UV light to preserve freshly made juice for a longer duration. This feature would allow users to make larger batches of juice and store them without losing nutritional value or flavor. The juicer could automatically package the juice in eco-friendly containers, making it easier for users to grab and go.",
    "**Interactive Juicing Experience**: Design a juicer with an interactive touchscreen interface that guides users through the juicing process. The screen could provide step-by-step instructions, suggest ingredient pairings, and even offer fun facts about the health benefits of different fruits and vegetables. This gamified experience would make juicing more engaging, especially for children and those new to healthy eating.",
    "**Sustainable Materials and Design**: Focus on sustainability by creating a juicer made from recycled materials and designed for easy disassembly. This would allow users to recycle or replace individual parts instead of discarding the entire appliance. Additionally, the juicer could be powered by a solar panel, making it an eco-friendly option for health-conscious consumers."
