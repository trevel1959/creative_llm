    "**Ergonomic Grip Enhancements**: Design a customizable grip system for the bowling ball that allows bowlers to adjust the size and texture based on their hand shape and preference. This could include interchangeable grip pads that offer different textures (smooth, textured, rubberized) and shapes (curved, flat) to improve comfort and control during the throw.",
    "**Augmented Reality (AR) Coaching**: Create an AR application that pairs with a smart bowling ball. When users look through their smartphones or AR glasses, they can see visual guides projected onto the bowling lane, such as optimal angles, recommended foot placement, and even virtual bowling coaches providing tips. This immersive experience would help bowlers visualize their technique and make necessary adjustments in real-time.",
    "**Weight Distribution Adjustment**: Develop a bowling ball with adjustable weight distribution features. Bowlers could change the internal weights (e.g., via a dial or slider mechanism) to experiment with different ball dynamics and find their perfect throw. This could also allow for personalized training sessions where bowlers can simulate different conditions or practice specific techniques.",
    "**Bowling Ball with Built-in Cooling System**: Create a bowling ball that incorporates a lightweight cooling system to manage temperature during games. Excessive heat can affect grip and performance, so a small, battery-operated cooling mechanism could help maintain an optimal temperature. This would be especially useful in warm environments or during long tournaments.",
    "**Interactive Bowling Ball Case**: Design a high-tech bowling ball case that features a built-in display and speakers. This case could showcase stats, play motivational music, and provide visual tutorials for bowlers. It could also have a charging station for the smart bowling ball, ensuring that all tech is always ready to go. The case could connect to the user's phone for notifications and reminders about practice sessions or tournaments."
