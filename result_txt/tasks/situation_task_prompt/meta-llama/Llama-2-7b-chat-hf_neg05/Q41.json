    "Nature-Inspired Design: Embrace the beauty of the natural world and incorporate elements of nature into your home decor. Instead of using paint, use natural materials like branches, rocks, and leaves to create a unique and earthy aesthetic. For example, you could use branches to create a trellis-like frame for a living wall, or use rocks to create a mosaic pattern on a wall.",
    "Light-Based Decor: Since paint is no longer an option, focus on creating a visually interesting space through lighting. Use a combination of LED lights, fairy lights, and string lights to create a magical ambiance in your home. You could also experiment with color-changing lights to create a dynamic and ever-changing atmosphere.",
    "Textile-Based Decor: Since paint is no longer an option, use textiles to add color and pattern to your home.

    "Shadow Art: Take advantage of the lack of paint and create a unique form of shadow art. Use a combination of light sources and objects to create intricate and interesting shadows on your walls.
