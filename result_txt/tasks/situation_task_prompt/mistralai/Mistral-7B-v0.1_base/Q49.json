    "Install a fire sprinkler system in your home.  They are designed to quickly extinguish fires, which can help protect your home from damage caused by fires.  However, it is important to remember that a fire sprinkler system must be installed by a professional and be regularly inspected to ensure it is functioning correctly.",
    "The device would be more of a risk because without the ability to extinguish flames, the device may be much more vulnerable to fire.  This could also lead to the device being more liable to accidents of the same fire.  I don't think this will be a big problem, but the risk of this is higher.",
    "The device is able to be a fire detecting device.  However, I think that the device can not only extinguish a fire, but it can also prevent the device from igniting or extinguish the igniting device.  However, for the time being I think the fire extinguishers should be good enough to be able to extinguish any fire.  This could be a good step to prevent extinguish problems.",
    "There are two types of fire detectors, the fire detectors that are not connected to any power source, and the fire detectors that are connected to the power source.  In the first case, there is the device that can be used to detect the fire, and in the second case, there is the device that can be used to detect the fire.",
    "However, in other situations the device could be extinguished in case it is too heavy to extinguish it.  For example, if I have a device that extinguishes heavy objects I may have a problem, because I have to rely on the device to not extinguish it.  This is the only case when I may want to extinguish the device."
