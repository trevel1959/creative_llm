    "Create a smart tennis ball that tracks every shot and provides real-time feedback to players on their technique and performance. This tennis ball would be equipped with sensors and a small computer that would collect data on the player's swing, spin, and other factors. The data would be transmitted to a companion app on the player's phone, where they could view their progress and set goals for improvement.",
    "Develop a tennis ball that never goes flat. Using advanced materials and technology, this tennis ball would be designed to maintain its air pressure and bounce indefinitely. This would eliminate the frustration of having to constantly replace flat balls during a match, and would provide a more consistent and enjoyable playing experience.",
    "Invent a portable, inflatable tennis court that can be easily set up and taken down. This court would be made of lightweight, flexible materials that could be inflated with a bicycle pump or electric air compressor. It would be perfect for players who want to practice their serves and volleys on the go, or for tournaments that need a quick and easy setup.",
    "Create a smart tennis racket that provides real-time feedback on a player's technique and performance. This racket would be equipped with sensors that track the player's grip pressure, swing speed, and other factors, and would provide instant feedback on how to improve their game. The racket could also be connected to a companion app, where players could view their progress and compete with other players.",
    "Design a specialized tennis ball that glows in the dark, making it easier for players to see and hit the ball in low-light conditions. This ball would be made with a special coating that absorbs light and emits a soft, glowing light, providing a unique and fun playing experience. It would be perfect for nighttime matches or for players who want to practice their serves and volleys in the early morning or evening hours."
