    "Sun Dials: Develop a sundial that can detect changes in the sun's position and use it to predict the weather. As the sun moves, the sundial's shadow will also shift, providing clues about the temperature and humidity levels. Sundials are a great way to measure time without relying on clocks, and they can also predict weather patterns! 🌅🕰️",
    "Wind Changes: Pay attention to the direction and speed of the wind. Changes in wind patterns can indicate changes in weather. For example, if the wind is coming from the north, it might bring colder air, while a south wind means warmer weather is on the way. You could even create a wind vane to measure wind direction and use it to predict the weather! 🌬🌊",
    "Animal Behavior: Observe the behavior of animals like birds, squirrels, and butterflies. Changes in their behavior can indicate changes in the weather. For example, if birds are flying erratically or hiding in their nests, it might mean a storm is approaching. Or, if squirrels are scurrying around frantically, it could indicate a warm and sunny day! 🐦🐿️🦋",
    "Atmospheric Pressure: Measure changes in atmospheric pressure to predict the weather. High pressure means fair weather, while low pressure indicates an approaching storm. You could even create a barometer to measure pressure changes and predict the weather! 💡🔧"
