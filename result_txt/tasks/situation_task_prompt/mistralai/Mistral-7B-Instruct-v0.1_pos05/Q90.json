    "Desalination: If there was no more rain, one way to collect water would be through desalination. This process involves removing salt and other impurities from seawater to make it safe for human consumption. With desalination, we could collect fresh water from the ocean even if it doesn't rain.",
    "Greywater harvesting: Another way to collect water would be through greywater harvesting. This involves collecting the wastewater from sinks, showers, and washing machines and using it for irrigation or other non-potable uses. Greywater can be treated and filtered to make it safe for use.",
    "Rainwater harvesting: Even if it doesn't rain, we can still collect rainwater that has fallen in the past. This involves collecting and storing rainwater in a tank or cistern. The water can be used for irrigation or other non-potable uses.",
    "Wastewater treatment: Another way to collect water would be through wastewater treatment. This involves treating wastewater from homes and businesses to make it safe for use. The treated water can be used for irrigation or other non-potable uses.",
    "Solar still: A solar still is a device that uses the sun's heat to extract water from plants or other sources. It involves placing a container over a bed of salt or other materials that absorb moisture. The salt or materials draw the moisture up and into the container, which can then be used for drinking or other purposes."
