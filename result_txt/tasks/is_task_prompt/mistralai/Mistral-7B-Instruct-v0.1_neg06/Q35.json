    "The mirror shows a reflection that is not a reflection at all: When a person looks into the mirror, they see a distorted image of themselves, but when they look into the mirror of another world, they see a completely different reflection that doesn't even resemble them. This could be due to the fact that the other world has different physical laws or that the mirror itself has been tampered with.",
    "The mirror shows a reflection that is always a step ahead: When a person looks into the mirror of another world, they see a reflection that is always a step ahead of them, no matter where they move or what they do. This could be due to the fact that the other world has different physical laws that allow for time travel or that the mirror itself has been manipulated to show a reflection that is always one step ahead.",
    "The mirror shows a reflection that is: When a person looks into the mirror of another world, they see a reflection that is for that world. This could be due to the fact that the other world is for that person, or that the mirror itself has been imbued with the power to show a reflection that represents the person's deepest desires and fears.",
