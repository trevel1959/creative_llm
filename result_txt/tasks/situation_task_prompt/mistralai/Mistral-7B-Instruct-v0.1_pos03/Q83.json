    "Adapt to the new routine: If there were no more night-time, we would have to adjust our daily routines and sleep patterns. We could start going to bed earlier in the day and wake up earlier in the morning. This would allow us to get more sleep during the day and still have a regular sleep cycle.",
    "Try new sleep methods: We could experiment with different sleep methods that don't require a complete darkness, such as using a white noise machine or listening to calming music. We could also try using natural light or aromatherapy to help us relax and fall asleep.",
    "Use light therapy: Light therapy is a medical treatment that uses light to regulate our circadian rhythms. We could use a light box to simulate the effects of sunlight in the morning and evening, which could help us regulate our sleep patterns and improve our mood.",
    "Practice meditation: Meditation is a powerful tool for relaxation and stress reduction. We could try practicing meditation in the morning and evening to help us relax and prepare for sleep.",
    "Get outdoors: Spending time outdoors during the day can help us regulate our circadian rhythms and improve our mood. We could try taking a walk or doing some outdoor activities in the morning and evening to help us relax and prepare for sleep."
