    "The End of Education: If everyone became a genius overnight, the traditional education system would no longer be relevant. The concept of schooling and learning would need to be redefined, as people would no longer require formal training to acquire knowledge and skills. This could lead to a democratization of knowledge, where everyone has access to the same level of intelligence and problem-solving abilities, regardless of their background or socio-economic status. However, this could also lead to a loss of social hierarchy and power dynamics, as those who were previously in positions of authority would no longer hold the same sway.",

People would no longer be defined solely by their personal achievements, but rather by their contributions to the collective. The focus would shift from individual success to the success of the group, leading to a more collaborative and cooperative society. This could lead to a more harmonious and peaceful world, where people work together to solve problems and achieve common goals.",
