    "A Smart Coat Rack: Create a coat rack that can be controlled through an app, allowing users to hang their coats and track their location in real-time. This coat rack can also have sensors to detect when a coat is placed or removed, and adjust the lighting and temperature of the room accordingly.",
    "A Multi-Functional Coat Rack: Design a coat rack that serves multiple purposes. For example, it could have a built-in shoe rack, a small table for holding keys and wallets, and even a hook for hanging bags or backpacks. This coat rack would be perfect for small spaces where storage is limited.",
    "A Coat Rack with a Twist: Create a coat rack that is designed to resemble a piece of art. Instead of a traditional rectangular shape, this coat rack could have a unique, twisted design that adds a touch of whimsy to any room. The coat rack could also have a built-in lighting system to highlight the unique design.",
    "A Coat Rack with a Sustainable Twist: Design a coat rack made from sustainable materials such as reclaimed wood or bamboo. This coat rack could also have a built-in water-based coat drying system, which would help to reduce energy consumption and minimize the impact on the environment.",
    "A Coat Rack with Smart Technology: Create a coat rack that can learn your habits and preferences over time. For example, it could have sensors that detect when you typically hang your coat, and adjust the lighting and temperature of the room accordingly. This coat rack could also have a built-in alarm system that alerts you when someone enters the room, or when a coat is removed."
