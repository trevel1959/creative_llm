    "Solar Roadways: This innovative idea involves installing solar panels directly into the roads of a city, transforming the infrastructure into a sustainable energy source. The panels would be made of durable materials and could generate electricity from both sunlight and vehicle traffic, providing a continuous flow of clean energy.",
    "Solar-Powered Housing Projects: Developing affordable and eco-friendly housing projects that incorporate solar panels into the design. This could involve building homes with integrated solar panels on the roofs or walls, providing residents with a reliable source of renewable energy.",
    "Solar-Powered Vehicle Charging Stations: Establishing a network of solar-powered vehicle charging stations throughout the city, providing a convenient and sustainable way for residents to charge their electric vehicles. These stations could be installed in public parking lots, parks, or other high-traffic areas.",
    "Solar-Powered Community Centers: Creating community centers that run entirely on solar power, providing a hub for community events, educational programs, and other activities. These centers could also serve as a model for sustainable living and energy efficiency, inspiring others to adopt similar practices.",
    "Solar-Powered Parks and Gardens: Transforming public parks and gardens into solar-powered oases, using the land to generate electricity while also providing a peaceful and enjoyable green space for residents. This could involve installing solar panels on the ground, in gardens, or even in the form of interactive art installations."
