    "A language with a unique system of hand gestures that accompany spoken words. It could include a variety of gestures that convey specific meaning, such as thumbs up for \"yes\" or fingers crossed for \"maybe.\"",
    "A language that has no vowels. The sound of the language would consist of consonants and a combination of clicks and glottal stops, creating a harsh and sharp language.",
    "A language with words made up of only syllable shifts and tone changes. The syntax would be relatively simple, but the unique pronunciation would make it easily recognizable.",
