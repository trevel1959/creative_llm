    "**Innovative Coffee Bean Roasting System:** Create a coffee grinder that is also a roaster. This machine would allow you to roast and grind coffee beans in one single device. You can adjust the temperature and duration for roasting according to your preference. After roasting, the beans are ground right away, ensuring maximum freshness. This idea combines two common kitchen appliances into one efficient gadget.",
    "**Smart Coffee Grind Adjustment System:** Develop a smart coffee grinder that automatically adjusts its grind size based on the brewing method selected. The user inputs the type of brew (e.g., espresso, French press, drip coffee) and the grinder adjusts its settings accordingly, ensuring optimal results for each brewing technique. This system saves time and effort by removing the need to manually select the correct grind setting.",
    "**Coffee Grind Recycling System:** Design a coffee grinder with a built-in composting feature. The used coffee grounds can be composted within the device itself, turning waste into a valuable resource. The compost can then be used for gardening or as a natural fertilizer. This idea promotes sustainability and reduces waste, making it an eco-friendly addition to any home or office.",
    "**Portable, Rechargeable Coffee Grinder:** Create a compact, portable coffee grinder that runs on rechargeable batteries. This device is perfect for camping trips, picnics, or travel. It's lightweight, easy to use, and ensures that you can enjoy freshly ground coffee anywhere without needing access to power outlets. The rechargeable feature eliminates the need for disposable batteries, making it an environmentally friendly option.",
    "**Visual Grind Size Indicator:** Develop a coffee grinder with a transparent container that allows you to visually monitor the grinding process. As the coffee beans are ground, the size of the particles can be observed, helping users achieve their desired consistency more accurately. This feature could include a scale or markings on the container to guide users in adjusting the grind size. It offers a unique, interactive experience while ensuring consistent results every time."
