    "**Emergency Response and Rescue Operations**: First responders could utilize this ability during emergencies, such as natural disasters or fires, to locate individuals trapped inside buildings. By seeing through walls, they could quickly assess the situation, identify safe paths for rescue, and prioritize their efforts based on the number of people in need of assistance. This could save lives and improve response times, especially in situations where every second counts. Additionally, it could be used to find hazardous materials or structural weaknesses in buildings that could pose risks during rescue operations.",
    "**Enhanced Security Systems**: Security personnel could use this power to monitor premises without the need for intrusive surveillance systems. By seeing through walls, they could detect unauthorized access or suspicious activity within buildings in real-time. This would allow for proactive measures to be taken before a situation escalates, providing a safer environment for both businesses and residential areas. Additionally, this ability could help in assessing the effectiveness of existing security measures and identifying vulnerabilities that need to be addressed.",
    "**Interior Design Innovation**: Interior designers could leverage this ability to create more personalized and functional spaces. By seeing through walls, they could better understand how natural light flows through a building, where the best spots for furniture placement are, and how to maximize storage solutions. This would enable them to create tailored designs that not only look good but also enhance the living experience for occupants. Furthermore, it could inspire new design trends based on the unique configurations of existing spaces.",
    "**Historical Preservation**: Historians and preservationists could use this power to explore and study historical buildings without causing any damage. By seeing through walls, they could uncover hidden features, such as original architectural elements or artifacts that have been concealed over time. This information could be invaluable for restoration projects, allowing for a more accurate representation of the building's original state. It could also lead to new discoveries about the history of the area and the people who lived there.",
    "**Conflict Resolution and Mediation**: In situations where disputes arise, such as in family homes or workplaces, having the ability to see through walls could facilitate conflict resolution. Mediators could gain insights into the dynamics at play without intruding on private conversations. This understanding could help them identify underlying issues, encourage open communication, and foster a more harmonious environment. By providing a unique perspective, this power could lead to more effective and empathetic solutions to conflicts."
