    "**Color-Changing Post-it Notes**: Develop Post-it Notes that change color based on temperature or exposure to light. This could serve as a visual cue for different statusesâ€”like red for urgent tasks, yellow for reminders, and green for completed tasks. The color change would make it easier to prioritize tasks at a glance and add a fun, interactive element to note-taking.",
    "**Sticky Note Calendar**: Create a series of Post-it Notes designed to be used as a monthly planner. Each note could represent a day, and users could stick them on a wall or board to create a visual calendar. The notes could be color-coded for different types of events (work, personal, deadlines) and could have a space for time slots, making it easier to plan out days visually.",
    "**Post-it Note Notebooks**: Design a notebook that features removable Post-it Note pages instead of traditional paper. This would allow users to jot down thoughts and easily rearrange or remove notes as needed. The notebook could also have a built-in index system to help users organize their notes by category or priority, making it a dynamic tool for brainstorming and project planning.",
    "**Augmented Reality (AR) Post-it Notes**: Integrate AR technology with Post-it Notes. Users could use an app to scan their notes, which would then overlay additional information or reminders in AR. For example, scanning a note could show a checklist, relevant links, or even a short video explaining the task. This would transform a simple note into a more interactive and informative tool.",
    "**Eco-Friendly Post-it Notes**: Introduce a line of biodegradable or recycled Post-it Notes made from sustainable materials. These notes could be compostable or made from post-consumer waste, appealing to environmentally conscious consumers. Additionally, they could be infused with seeds so that once the note is no longer needed, it can be planted to grow flowers or herbs, promoting sustainability and reducing waste."
