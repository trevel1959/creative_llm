    "Smart Flashlight with AI-Powered Dimming: Develop a flashlight with an AI-powered dimming system that can adjust the brightness based on the user's surroundings. The flashlight could use computer vision algorithms to detect the amount of light in the environment and automatically adjust the brightness to prevent glare or overexposure. This would provide a more comfortable and efficient lighting experience for users.",
    "Waterproof Flashlight with Built-in Purification System: Create a flashlight that can purify water using a built-in UV-C light and activated carbon filter. This would be particularly useful for outdoor enthusiasts and adventurers who may find themselves in remote areas without access to clean drinking water. The flashlight could also include a portable water container for storing purified water.",
    "Wireless Flashlight with Bluetooth Connectivity: Develop a flashlight that can be controlled wirelessly using a Bluetooth app on a smartphone or tablet. This would allow users to turn the flashlight on and off, adjust the brightness, and even change the color of the light from a distance. This would be particularly useful for outdoor activities such as camping or hiking, where users may not want to carry a separate remote control.",
    "Solar-Powered Flashlight with Energy Harvesting: Create a flashlight that can harness energy from the sun to power the light. The flashlight could include solar panels on the body of the light or a detachable solar panel that can be used to recharge the battery. This would provide a sustainable and eco-friendly lighting solution for users who may not have access to electricity or batteries.",
    "Augmented Reality Flashlight with Holographic Projections: Develop a flashlight that can project holographic images onto the environment using a built-in laser and mirrors. The flashlight could include a series of pre-programmed images or allow users to create their own holographic projections using a companion app. This would provide a unique and immersive lighting experience for users, and could be used for a variety of applications such as entertainment, education, or even advertising."
