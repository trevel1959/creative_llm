The box could have slots for different pieces, such as small cardboard figures or tokens. Underneath each slot, there could be a question or challenge that requires the consumer to answer or complete a task to win prizes, like stickers or additional entries into a grand prize draw.",
    "**Customizable Cereal Box Art**: Develop a cereal box with an embedded QR code that, when scanned with a smartphone, reveals a digital canvas where consumers can create custom artwork using various colors, shapes, and designs. This artwork could then be shared on social media platforms with a unique hashtag associated with the brand, creating a community of art enthusiasts.",
    "**Eco-Friendly Cereal Box**: Create a cereal box made from sustainable materials like recycled paper, plant-based plastics, or biodegradable fibers.

    "**Sensory Experience Cereal Box**: Design a cereal box that incorporates sensory elements, such as scents or tactile textures, to enhance the overall experience of consuming the cereal.

    "**Educational Cereal Box**: Produce a cereal box with educational content printed on it, such as nutrition facts, health tips, or fun facts about the ingredients used in the cereal.
