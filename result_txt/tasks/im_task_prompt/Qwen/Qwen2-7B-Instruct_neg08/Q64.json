    "**Task Progress Visualization Alarm**: Create an alarm system that uses visual cues to help you track your task progress. For example, a digital clock with a color-changing interface that turns green when you reach certain milestones or yellow when you're behind schedule. This not only makes tracking your progress visually engaging but also acts as a gentle reminder of your achievements.",
    "**Progressive Reward System**: Design an alarm that triggers a reward after completing each task or set of tasks. These rewards could be anything from a motivational quote to a brief relaxation session, helping to boost morale and reduce feelings of envy by focusing on personal growth and achievement rather than comparing yourself to others.",
    "**Task-Completion Soundtrack**: Develop an alarm that plays music or sounds after you complete a task. Choose songs that match the tone of the task (e.g., upbeat for a quick task, calming for a more involved one). This can create a sense of accomplishment and pleasure in completing tasks, potentially reducing feelings of envy.",
    "**Goal-Setting Reminder**: Implement an alarm system that prompts you to set goals and review your progress regularly. By focusing on setting and achieving your own goals, you'll avoid the trap of comparing yourself to others. The reminders can include setting small, achievable daily goals and reflecting on what you've accomplished at the end of each day or week.",
    "**Productivity Enhancement App**: Create an app that integrates various features like task management, goal setting, and progress tracking. This app could also include motivational quotes, daily challenges, and a community feature where users share their experiences and successes. By being part of a supportive community, you can feel less isolated and more motivated, which might help alleviate feelings of jealousy when seeing others' achievements."
