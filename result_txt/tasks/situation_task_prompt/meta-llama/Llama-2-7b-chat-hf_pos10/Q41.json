    "Nature-Inspired Wall Art: If all paint disappeared, I would turn to nature for inspiration. I would use natural elements like branches, rocks, and leaves to create unique wall art. I would collect different types of branches and arrange them in a visually appealing way to create a branch mobile. I would also use rocks to create a rock garden on my walls, arranging them in a pattern that would add texture and depth to the space. Additionally, I would use leaves to create a leaf mural, using different colors and shapes to create a vibrant and lively design.",
    "Light-Based Decor: Without paint, I would focus on using light to create a visually interesting space. I would use LED lights in different colors and shapes to create a light installation that would add depth and dimension to my home. I could also use mirrors to reflect light and create the illusion of a larger space. I would also incorporate candles and other light sources to create a warm and inviting ambiance.",
    "Textile-Based Decor: If all paint disappeared, I would turn to textiles to add color and pattern to my home. I would use a variety of textiles such as scarves, blankets, and rugs to create a unique and eye-catching design. I would hang the scarves on the walls as a tapestry, using them to create a colorful and patterned mural. I would also use blankets to create a cozy and inviting atmosphere, draping them over furniture or using them as a wall hanging.",
    "Shadow Puppetry: Without paint, I would use shadow puppetry to create a unique and interactive decorative element in my home. I would use a flashlight or lamp to cast shadows on the walls, creating a variety of shapes and designs. I could also use objects like sticks, leaves, and other natural materials to create more complex and intricate designs. This would add a playful and whimsical touch to my home.",
    "Natural Dye-Based Art: If all paint disappeared, I would use natural dyes to create a unique and colorful decorative element in my home. I would use fruits, vegetables, and herbs to create a variety of colors and shades, and then use these natural dyes to paint or stain different surfaces in my home. This"
