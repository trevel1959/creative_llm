    "Hyperloop: A high-speed transportation system that uses magnetic levitation and vacuum sealing to transport passengers and cargo at speeds of up to 700 mph. This would significantly reduce travel times between cities and provide a more efficient mode of transportation.",
    "Floating Cities: A concept where entire cities are built on large, buoyant platforms that can be moved to different locations as needed. This would allow for the creation of new, sustainable communities in areas with limited land availability.",
    "Personal Submarines: A personal submarine that can be used for both transportation and leisure activities. This would allow people to explore the ocean's depths and experience underwater life in a safe and comfortable manner.",
    "Sky Tunnels: A network of elevated tunnels that connect different parts of a city, allowing for fast and efficient transportation without the need for roads or traffic.",
    "Maglev Trains: A magnetic levitation train system that uses magnets to levitate the train and reduce friction, allowing for faster speeds and more efficient transportation."
