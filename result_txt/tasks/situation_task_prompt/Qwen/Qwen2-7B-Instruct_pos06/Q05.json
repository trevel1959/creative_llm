    "**Utilizing Moonlight**: One creative solution would be to harness the power of moonlight as an alternative source of light during the day. By installing large, reflective surfaces or mirrors around your area, you can increase the amount of moonlight reaching the ground, thereby providing sufficient illumination during the day. The reflective surfaces would need to be strategically placed to capture as much moonlight as possible. This idea has a confidence score of 0.9 because it leverages existing natural resources.",
    "**Innovative Solar Panels**: Develop solar panels that are optimized for moonlight, which could still generate electricity even when the sun doesn't rise. These panels would use different materials or technologies that can efficiently convert low-intensity light into energy. The confidence in this idea is 0.8 due to the potential advancements in technology required to make such panels effective.",
    "**Lanterns and Torch Candles**: Implementing traditional but effective lighting methods, like lanterns and torch candles, could provide ample light during the day. These could be made from materials that are durable under low light conditions and might even incorporate elements that help them glow brighter in less light, such as phosphorescent paints. The confidence in this approach is 0.7 because while it's a tried-and-tested method, it may not be as efficient as newer technologies.",
    "**Bioluminescent Plants and Animals**: Cultivate bioluminescent plants and animals that can produce light naturally. This could involve genetically modifying organisms to produce light under low light conditions. While this is a highly speculative idea, advancements in genetic engineering might make it feasible in the future. The confidence in this concept is 0.6 given the current state of biotechnology and ethical considerations involved.",
    "**Infrared Lighting**: Develop and install infrared lighting systems that emit light in the infrared spectrum, which can be detected by the human eye even in very low light conditions. This technology would require sophisticated lighting equipment capable of converting infrared light into visible light. The confidence in this idea is 0.8 because it's based on established principles of physics and electronics, though the implementation might present technical challenges."
