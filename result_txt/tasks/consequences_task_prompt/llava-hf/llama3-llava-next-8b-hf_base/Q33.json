    "Predators and prey: Larger animals would change the dynamics of predator-prey relationships within ecosystems. For example, smaller animals would become more vulnerable to larger predators, while larger animals would need to adapt to hunt for new prey.",
    "Human-animal relationships: Larger animals could become more challenging to work with and interact with, potentially changing the way people interact with and manage these animals.",
    "Habitat change: Larger animals would require more space and resources to survive, leading to habitat changes and loss of biodiversity.",
    "Accidents and disasters: Larger animals could cause more destruction, particularly if they are unintentionally aggressive or panicked. For example, large birds could drop more droppings on buildings and roads, creating slippery surfaces and potential accidents.",
    "Evolutionary adaptations: Larger animals may face more selection pressures to adapt to survive and thrive in their new size, potentially leading to new physical and behavioral adaptations."
