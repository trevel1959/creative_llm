    "**Environmental Impact**: The construction of Olympic venues and the influx of tourists can lead to environmental degradation. To address this, host cities could implement strict sustainability measures, such as using eco-friendly materials for construction, creating green spaces, and ensuring that all venues meet LEED certification standards.",
    "**Economic Disparities**: While the Olympics can boost local economies, they can also exacerbate existing inequalities. Many local residents may not benefit from the economic boom, as costs of living rise and businesses cater primarily to tourists. To counteract this, organizers could establish community funds that allocate a portion of Olympic revenue to support local businesses and initiatives.",
    "**Security Concerns**: The global spotlight on the Olympics can make it a target for terrorism and other security threats. Host cities need to invest heavily in security measures, which can divert funds from other essential services. A solution could be the implementation of advanced technology, such as AI-driven surveillance systems, alongside community engagement programs that foster trust between security forces and local populations.",
    "**Cultural Sensitivity**: Hosting the Olympics in a culturally diverse city may lead to misunderstandings or conflicts regarding local customs and traditions. To ensure inclusivity, organizers could launch cultural exchange programs that highlight local traditions, engage local artists, and educate visitors about the host culture.",
    "**Athlete Welfare**: The pressure to perform at the Olympics can lead to mental health issues among athletes. To promote well-being, organizers could establish mental health support systems, including counseling services, wellness workshops, and dedicated spaces for relaxation and recovery, ensuring that athletes are supported throughout their Olympic journey."
