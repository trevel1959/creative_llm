    "**Self-Opening and Closing Mechanism**: Imagine an umbrella that automatically opens and closes based on the user's proximity or a simple gesture. Using motion sensors, the umbrella could detect when the user is about to walk into rain and open itself, or it could close automatically when the user enters a building. This feature would be especially useful for people carrying multiple items.",
    "**Portable Solar Charger**: Incorporate flexible solar panels into the fabric of the umbrella. This would allow the umbrella to charge small devices like smartphones and tablets while providing shade or rain protection. Users could plug their devices into a built-in USB port, making it perfect for outdoor activities like festivals, picnics, or hiking.",
    "**Mood-Enhancing LED Lighting**: Integrate LED lights into the ribs of the umbrella that can change colors based on the user's mood or the weather. For instance, the lights could glow blue on rainy days to promote a calm atmosphere or switch to bright colors on sunny days to uplift the user's spirits. The lights could also be programmed to flash in patterns for visibility at night.",
    "**Eco-Friendly, Biodegradable Materials**: Develop an umbrella made from entirely biodegradable materials, such as plant-based plastics and organic fabrics. This would appeal to environmentally conscious consumers and reduce the environmental impact of discarded umbrellas. The umbrella could also feature a seed-embedded handle, allowing users to plant it after use, growing a tree or plant.",
    "**Multi-Function Umbrella**: Design an umbrella that can transform into other useful tools. For example, the handle could detach and become a walking stick or a small chair. The canopy could double as a picnic blanket when spread out on the ground. This versatility would make the umbrella an essential tool for outdoor enthusiasts, combining multiple functions into one portable item."
