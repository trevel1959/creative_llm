My morphing ability would allow me to build stronger relationships, foster empathy, and create a sense of community.",
    "**Interdimensional Traveler**: I'd use my power to change my appearance to traverse different dimensions and realities.

Imagine being able to attend a dinner party in a world where gravity works differently, or to explore the inner workings of a fantasy realm. My morphing ability would grant me access to the infinite possibilities of the multiverse. [/INST] "
