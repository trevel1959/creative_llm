    "**Fresh Water Collection**: Finding fresh water is crucial for survival. I would look for streams or springs, but if none are available, I would create a rainwater collection system using large leaves or containers to catch rain. I would also consider digging a shallow hole in the sand, which might collect groundwater. Boiling any collected water over a fire would be necessary to purify it.",
    "**Foraging for Food**: I would begin exploring the island for edible plants, fruits, and nuts. I would focus on learning about local flora, identifying safe-to-eat items like coconuts, berries, and seaweed. If I found fish or shellfish, I would gather them as well. To ensure a balanced diet, I would keep a lookout for any signs of wildlife, potentially setting traps or using makeshift fishing tools to catch them.",
    "**Creating Tools**: To aid in food gathering and shelter building, I would fashion tools from natural resources. Sharp stones could be used to create knives for cutting, while sticks could serve as spears for fishing. I would also look for vines or strong fibers to create nets or snares, enhancing my ability to catch food and build sturdy structures.",
    "**Fire-Making Techniques**: Fire would be essential for cooking food, purifying water, and providing warmth. I would gather dry twigs and leaves, then use friction methods like a bow drill or hand drill to create sparks. If I could find natural flint or stones, I would strike them together to create fire. Maintaining a fire would be crucial, so I would build a fire pit using stones to contain it safely.",
    "**Signaling for Rescue**: To increase my chances of being rescued, I would create visible signals. This could include arranging rocks or logs in large, noticeable patterns on the beach, creating smoke signals by building a fire with green leaves, or using reflective materials (like shiny shells or glass) to catch the attention of passing boats or planes."
