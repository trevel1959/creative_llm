    "**Pet Toy with a Twist**: While tennis balls are commonly used as dog toys, you can enhance their functionality by cutting a small slit in the ball and inserting treats or kibble. This creates a puzzle toy that encourages your pet to roll the ball around to get the treats out, stimulating their mind and keeping them entertained.",
    "**Garden Tool Holder**: Cut a tennis ball in half and attach it to a wall or fence as a small holder for garden tools. The soft rubber can securely cradle the handles of trowels, pruners, and other small tools, keeping your garden organized and tools easily accessible.",
    "**Car Door Protector**: To prevent dings and scratches on your car door from hitting the garage wall, cut a tennis ball in half and attach it to the wall at the height of your car door. The soft rubber will cushion the impact and protect both the car and the wall from damage.",
    "**Shoe Deodorizer**: Fill a tennis ball with baking soda by cutting a small slit and adding the powder inside. The ball can then be placed inside shoes to absorb moisture and odors. The porous nature of the tennis ball allows for airflow, while the baking soda neutralizes smells, making it a great natural deodorizer.",
    "**Stress Relief Tool**: Use a tennis ball as a stress-relief tool by squeezing it in your hand. This simple exercise can help relieve stress and anxiety, strengthen hand muscles, and improve grip strength. You can also roll it under your feet to relieve tension after a long day."
