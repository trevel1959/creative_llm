    "**Portable Snack Dispenser**: Use an empty tissue box to create a portable snack dispenser. Fill it with your favorite snacks like granola bars, nuts, or popcorn. You can cut a small opening on one side for easy access. This makes it convenient to take snacks on the go, whether for road trips, picnics, or just to keep in your car.",
    "**Gift Wrap Organizer**: Instead of tossing an empty tissue box, use it to store and organize your gift wrap rolls. Simply slide the rolls into the box, and they’ll be neatly contained. You can even label the box with different occasions (birthdays, holidays, etc.) for quick access when you need to wrap a gift.",
    "**DIY Bird Feeder**: Create a simple bird feeder by cutting openings in the sides of a tissue box and filling it with birdseed. Hang it from a tree branch with twine or string. The box can be painted or decorated to attract birds and add a decorative touch to your yard.",
    "**Pet Toy Dispenser**: Convert a tissue box into a fun toy dispenser for your pets. Fill it with small pet toys, and let your cat or dog have fun pulling them out one by one. This can provide entertainment for your pets and help keep their toys organized in one place.",
    "**Emergency Phone Stand**: In a pinch, an empty tissue box can serve as a makeshift phone stand. Simply cut a small slit in the top of the box, allowing your phone to sit upright. This is particularly useful for video calls or watching videos hands-free when you don’t have a proper stand available."
