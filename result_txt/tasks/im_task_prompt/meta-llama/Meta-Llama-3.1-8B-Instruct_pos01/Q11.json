    "**Self-Sustaining Water Bottle**: Design a water bottle that doubles as a mini-greenhouse, allowing users to grow their own herbs or microgreens while they drink. The bottle features a built-in hydroponic system, a LED light, and a temperature control mechanism. As the user drinks, the bottle's cap opens to allow air and water to circulate, promoting healthy plant growth. The self-sustaining water bottle encourages users to think about the water they consume and its impact on the environment.",
    "**Smart Water Bottle with Air Quality Monitoring**: Develop a water bottle that not only tracks the user's hydration levels but also monitors the air quality around them. The bottle features a built-in air quality sensor that detects pollutants, allergens, and other airborne particles. The sensor data is then displayed on a companion app, allowing users to take proactive steps to improve their surroundings. This innovative water bottle promotes a healthier lifestyle by connecting hydration to air quality.",
    "**Shape-Shifting Water Bottle**: Design a water bottle that can change its shape and size to fit different users and environments. The bottle features a unique material that can be molded and reshaped using a combination of heat and pressure. This adaptability makes the water bottle perfect for outdoor activities, travel, or daily use. The shape-shifting water bottle encourages users to think creatively about their hydration needs.",
    "**Water Bottle with Integrated Filter and Purification System**: Create a water bottle that features a built-in filter and purification system, allowing users to drink clean water anywhere. The bottle uses advanced nanotechnology to remove impurities, bacteria, and viruses from the water. This innovative water bottle ensures users have access to safe drinking water, even in areas with questionable water quality.",
    "**Interactive Water Bottle with Augmented Reality Experience**: Develop a water bottle that uses augmented reality (AR) technology to create an immersive experience for users. The bottle features a built-in camera and display, which, when used in conjunction with a companion app, brings interactive games, educational content, and personalized hydration tracking to life. This innovative water bottle encourages users to engage with their hydration goals in a fun and interactive way."
