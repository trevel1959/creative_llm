    "In a hidden glen, a spider named Aurelia spun golden webs that shimmered like the sun. The villagers believed her webs brought good fortune, and they would leave offerings at the edge of the forest. One day, a greedy merchant sought to capture Aurelia and steal her magic. As he approached, the spider wove a web so intricate that it ensnared him in his own greed. Instead of gold, Aurelia offered him a lesson: true wealth lies not in riches but in the kindness we share. The merchant left with a heart full of humility, and the glen flourished with joy.",
