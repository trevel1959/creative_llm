    "**Emergency Response Optimization**: In emergency situations, such as fires or natural disasters, I would collaborate with first responders to develop a specialized tool that allows them to see through walls in real-time. This technology would help locate trapped individuals, assess structural integrity, and identify safe evacuation routes. By providing crucial information instantly, this power could save lives and enhance the efficiency of rescue operations.",
    "**Home Design and Renovation Consulting**: I would start a consulting service for homeowners looking to renovate or redesign their spaces. By seeing through walls, I could assess the structural elements of a home, identify load-bearing walls, and suggest optimal design changes without compromising safety. This service would include virtual walkthroughs of proposed renovations, allowing clients to visualize their new spaces before any construction begins.",
    "**Crime Prevention Initiative**: Partnering with law enforcement, I would develop a community safety program that uses my ability to see through walls to monitor suspicious activities in neighborhoods. By discreetly observing areas prone to crime, I could provide valuable insights and alerts to local authorities, helping them prevent criminal activities before they occur. This initiative would aim to create safer communities while respecting privacy and civil rights.",
    "**Artistic Installation Projects**: I would collaborate with artists to create immersive installations that play with the concept of visibility and concealment. These projects could involve transforming spaces into interactive experiences where participants can \"see\" through walls using augmented reality, showcasing hidden stories and narratives within the architecture. This would not only promote artistic expression but also encourage viewers to think critically about the spaces they inhabit.",
    "**Educational Tool for Architects and Engineers**: I would develop an educational platform for architecture and engineering students that utilizes my ability to see through walls as a learning tool. This platform would provide virtual simulations of various building structures, allowing students to analyze design elements, understand structural integrity, and explore the relationship between form and function. By offering hands-on experience with real-world applications, students would gain valuable insights into their future careers."
