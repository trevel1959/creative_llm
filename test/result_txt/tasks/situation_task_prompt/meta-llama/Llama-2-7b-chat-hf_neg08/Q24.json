    "Developing a Virtual Reality System for Visual Aids: In a world without glasses or contact lenses, people with poor vision could use a virtual reality system to enhance their visual capabilities. This system would use advanced algorithms and sensors to create a virtual environment that can be customized to the individual's needs. For example, the system could enhance the contrast and brightness of objects, provide real-time subtitles for visually impaired individuals, or even offer a virtual guide for navigation.",
    "Bionic Eye Implants: Bionic eye implants could be developed to restore vision to those with poor eyesight. These implants would use microchips and cameras to convert light into electrical signals that could be interpreted by the brain. This technology already exists in some forms, but advancements could make it more accessible and effective.",
    "Augmented Reality Glasses: Augmented reality glasses could be designed to assist people with poor vision by providing a virtual overlay of the environment. These glasses would use sensors and cameras to detect objects and people around the wearer and superimpose digital information onto their field of view. For example, virtual arrows could be displayed to indicate the location of nearby objects, or virtual labels could be placed on objects to help the wearer identify them.",
    "Brain-Computer Interface Devices: Brain-computer interface devices could be developed to restore vision to those with poor eyesight by directly connecting the brain to a computer. These devices would use electroencephalography (EEG) or other technologies to detect electrical signals in the brain and translate them into visual images. This technology is still in its infancy, but it has the potential to revolutionize the way we think about vision loss.",
    "Artificial Retina Implants: Artificial retina implants could be developed to restore vision to those with poor eyesight. These implants would use a microchip to mimic the function of a natural retina, converting light into electrical signals that could be interpreted by the brain. This technology already exists in some forms, but advancements could make it more accessible and effective."
