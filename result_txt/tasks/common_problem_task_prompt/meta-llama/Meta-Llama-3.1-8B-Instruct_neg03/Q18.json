    "**Eco-Friendly Community**: Establish a self-sustaining community where residents live off the grid, relying on renewable energy sources like solar, wind, and hydro power. The community would be designed to minimize waste and maximize efficiency, with composting toilets, rainwater harvesting, and a shared garden for food production. Residents would work together to maintain the community's infrastructure and share knowledge on sustainable living practices.",
    "**Pre-Industrial Revival**: Create a historical reenactment village where people live and work as they would have in the 18th or 19th century. Residents would be skilled craftsmen and women, working with traditional tools and techniques to produce goods like textiles, pottery, and metalwork. The village would be a hub for cultural and educational events, showcasing the skills and knowledge of the past.",
    "**Nomadic Lifestyle**: Develop a mobile community of nomads who travel the country in specially designed, eco-friendly vehicles. These nomads would be a tribe of skilled artisans, musicians, and performers, living off the land and relying on their wits and resourcefulness to survive. They would collect and trade goods, share stories, and learn from each other as they travel.",
    "**Underground City**: Design an underground city, where residents live in a network of tunnels and caverns. This city would be powered by geothermal energy and feature advanced recycling systems, minimizing waste and conserving resources. Residents would be experts in sustainable living, with a focus on permaculture, aquaponics, and bioluminescent lighting.",
    "**Floating Village**: Create a floating village on a large, sustainable barge or series of barges. Residents would live and work on the water, relying on solar power, wind energy, and hydroponics for food production. The village would be a hub for eco-tourism, with residents offering guided tours and educational programs on sustainable living practices and marine conservation. [/INST] "
