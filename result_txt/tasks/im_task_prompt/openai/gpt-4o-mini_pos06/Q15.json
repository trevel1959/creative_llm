    "**Modular Compartments**: Create a modular backpack with interchangeable compartments that can be added or removed based on the user's needs. For instance, a user could add a larger compartment for a laptop, a smaller one for toiletries, or a specialized compartment for sports gear. This would allow for ultimate customization and versatility, making it suitable for various activities like school, travel, or outdoor adventures.",
    "**Integrated Charging System**: Incorporate a solar panel on the backpack's exterior along with a built-in power bank that can charge devices on the go. This would be particularly useful for travelers or students who need to keep their gadgets powered throughout the day. The backpack could also feature wireless charging pockets for compatible devices, enhancing convenience.",
    "**Ergonomic Support System**: Design a backpack with an advanced ergonomic support system that includes adjustable straps, lumbar support, and a built-in suspension system to distribute weight evenly. This could help prevent back pain and discomfort, especially for users who carry heavy loads. Additionally, the backpack could feature a built-in cooling system to reduce sweat and discomfort during long wear.",
    "**Personal Safety Features**: Equip the backpack with personal safety features such as a built-in alarm system that can be activated in emergencies, a reflective strip for nighttime visibility, and a GPS tracker that can be linked to a smartphone app. This would enhance the safety of the user, especially in urban environments or while traveling alone.",
    "**Eco-Friendly Materials**: Shift to sustainable materials such as recycled plastics or organic cotton for the backpack's construction. Additionally, incorporate a plantable tag that contains seeds, allowing users to plant it after they no longer need the backpack. This would promote environmental awareness and encourage users to contribute to reforestation efforts."
