    "**Wildlife Disruption**: Increased human activity can disturb wildlife habitats, leading to disruptions in ecosystems. Animals might become accustomed to human presence, which can affect their natural behaviors and lead to issues like predation or conflict with humans. Implementing controlled zones for visitors, wildlife monitoring programs, and educating the public on wildlife conservation are key strategies.",
    "**Infrastructure Wearing Out**: Maintaining a vast area like a national park requires significant investment in infrastructure such as roads, trails, and facilities. With constant use, these structures can deteriorate quickly, leading to safety hazards and increased maintenance costs. Regular inspection, timely repairs, and sustainable construction materials can help manage this issue.",
    "**Lack of Funding**: National parks often face budget constraints that limit their ability to provide adequate services, maintain facilities, and enforce regulations effectively. This can result in underfunded conservation efforts, poor visitor experiences, and a decline in park health. Seeking diverse funding sources, partnerships with private organizations, and strategic cost-saving measures can help address this challenge.",
    "**Climate Change Impact**: National parks are highly sensitive to climate change, facing threats such as rising temperatures, changing precipitation patterns, and increased frequency of extreme weather events. These impacts can alter ecosystems, reduce biodiversity, and affect visitor access. Implementing adaptive management strategies, increasing park resilience, and engaging in collaborative conservation efforts can mitigate these effects.",
    "**Invasive Species**: Invasive plant and animal species can outcompete native species, disrupting local ecosystems and altering the balance of flora and fauna. Monitoring for new invasions, implementing eradication or control measures, and involving local communities in invasive species management are essential steps to protect park biodiversity."
