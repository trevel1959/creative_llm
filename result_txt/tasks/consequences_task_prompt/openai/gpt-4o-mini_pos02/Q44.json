With everyone able to sing, there would be a shift towards more collaborative music-making, possibly reducing the demand for solo artists. However, this could lead to the rise of new roles, such as music curators or experience designers, who create unique live events that blend technology, visual arts, and music, keeping the industry vibrant and dynamic.",
    "**Environmental Impact of Concerts**: With everyone capable of singing, large-scale concerts and festivals would become more frequent, leading to both positive and negative environmental impacts. On one hand, outdoor community events could promote environmental awareness through music, but on the other hand, increased travel and waste could harm ecosystems. This could spark a movement towards sustainable concert practices, with artists and fans advocating for eco-friendly events, using biodegradable materials and renewable energy sources.",
    "**Shifts in Communication**: Perfect singing abilities could change the way people communicate. Everyday conversations might incorporate melodic elements, making dialogue more expressive and engaging. This could lead to the creation of a new form of language that emphasizes rhythm and melody, resulting in a cultural shift where emotional expression becomes more important in daily interactions. The implications for literature and poetry would also be profound, as storytelling could evolve into more musical forms."
