    "**Expandable and Retractable Design**: Create a hose that can expand when water is flowing and retract when not in use. This design would minimize storage space and prevent tangling. The hose could use a durable, lightweight material that expands up to three times its original length, making it easy to maneuver around the garden while also being compact for storage.",
    "**Multi-Function Hose Nozzle**: Develop a hose nozzle that can switch between various functions, such as a sprinkler, jet spray, mist, and bubble foam for cleaning. This nozzle could feature customizable settings that allow users to adjust the pressure and spray pattern based on their gardening or cleaning needs, enhancing versatility in one tool.",
    "**Self-Cleaning Hose Technology**: Introduce a self-cleaning mechanism within the hose that uses a combination of UV light and water pressure to eliminate algae, bacteria, and other contaminants. This feature would keep the interior of the hose clean, improving water quality and prolonging the hose's lifespan without the need for manual cleaning.",
    "**Built-in Fertilizer Dispenser**: Design a hose with a built-in compartment for liquid fertilizers that can be mixed with water as it flows through the hose. This feature would allow for simultaneous watering and fertilizing, making it easier for gardeners to maintain healthy plants without the hassle of separate applications.",
    "**Flexible and Ergonomic Handle**: Create an ergonomic handle that can rotate and bend, allowing users to easily maneuver the hose around tight corners and obstacles in the garden. The handle could also feature a locking mechanism that secures the hose in place while watering, preventing kinks and ensuring a steady flow."
