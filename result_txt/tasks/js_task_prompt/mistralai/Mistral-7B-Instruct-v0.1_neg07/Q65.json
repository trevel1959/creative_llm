    "Luminescent Organisms: Create a new form of life that glows in the dark. These organisms could be bioluminescent and emit light through a chemical reaction in their bodies. They could live in deep-sea environments or in dark caves where sunlight does not penetrate. The light they emit could serve as a source of food for other organisms or as a means of communication.",
    "Nano-Bots: Create a new form of life that exists in the form of tiny robots. These bots could be made of advanced materials and could be programmed to perform a variety of tasks. They could be used for cleaning, repair, or even for exploration of other planets.",
    "Symbiotic Organisms: Create a new form of life that exists in a symbiotic relationship with other organisms. These organisms could be parasites that live on other organisms and provide them with nutrients or protection. They could also be mutualistic, where both organisms benefit from the relationship.",
    "Biomechanical Creatures: Create a new form of life that combines biological and mechanical elements. These creatures could have mechanical limbs or other mechanical structures that allow them to move and interact with their environment in unique ways.",
    "Gas Giants: Create a new form of life that exists in the form of giant balls of gas. These gas giants could be made up of helium, hydrogen, and other gases and could float through the air or water. They could communicate with each other through vibrations or changes in their size and shape."
