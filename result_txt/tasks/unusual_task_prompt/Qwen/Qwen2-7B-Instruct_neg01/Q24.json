    "**Toothbrush Plant Watering Device**: Design a toothbrush that can be repurposed as a plant watering device. The handle could contain a small reservoir of water, which can be used to water plants when the toothbrush is pressed against the soil. The bristles would then distribute the water evenly around the plant roots, ensuring optimal hydration. This invention could be especially useful for busy individuals who may forget to water their plants.",
    "**Toothbrush as a Fitness Tracker**: Develop a toothbrush with integrated sensors that monitor your brushing habits, such as duration, pressure, and frequency. This information can be synced to a smartphone app to provide personalized oral care tips and encourage better brushing techniques. The app might also offer rewards or badges for maintaining consistent brushing routines, making dental hygiene more engaging and fun.",
    "**Toothbrush and Floss Combination Tool**: Create a toothbrush with built-in flossing capabilities. After brushing, the bristles retract to expose a flossing section with tiny, flexible filaments. This allows users to floss effectively without needing an additional tool. The design could also include a mechanism to indicate when it's time to replace the floss section, promoting better oral health.",
    "**Toothbrush as a Personalized Oral Care Kit**: Design a toothbrush with a detachable head that can be replaced based on the user's needs. Each head could contain different ingredients like fluoride, baking soda, or charcoal, catering to specific oral health concerns such as cavity prevention, whitening, or gum health. The toothbrush itself could serve as a holder and dispenser for these personalized care products.",
    "**Toothbrush as a Smart Speaker**: Integrate a small speaker into the toothbrush handle that plays educational content or music while brushing. This not only makes the routine more enjoyable but also educates users about proper brushing techniques through interactive stories or guided brushing sessions. The smart speaker could also be voice-activated, allowing users to ask questions or set reminders related to oral health."
