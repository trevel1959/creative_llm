    "**Smart Coffee Grinder with Integrated Scale**: Design a coffee grinder that comes with an integrated scale, allowing users to precisely measure the amount of coffee beans they grind. The scale would be connected to a mobile app, enabling users to track their coffee consumption, monitor their caffeine intake, and receive personalized recommendations for optimal brewing. The grinder would also have a built-in timer, ensuring that the beans are ground to the perfect consistency for a specific brewing method.",
    "**Coffee Grinder with Built-in Flavor Profiler**: Create a coffee grinder that comes with a built-in flavor profiler, which uses AI-powered algorithms to analyze the user's taste preferences and recommend the perfect coffee-to-water ratio, brewing time, and grind size for their ideal cup. The profiler would learn the user's preferences over time, adapting to their changing tastes and adjusting the grind settings accordingly.",
    "**Smart Coffee Grinder with Automatic Cleaning**: Design a coffee grinder that incorporates an automated cleaning system, using a combination of ultrasonic cleaning and a built-in brush to remove coffee oils and residue from the grinding mechanism. This would ensure that the grinder remains clean and free of bacterial growth, reducing the risk of contamination and extending the lifespan of the device.",
    "**Coffee Grinder with Integrated Burr Maintenance**: Create a coffee grinder that comes with a built-in burr maintenance system, which uses a combination of sensors and a small motor to detect when the burrs are worn out or need to be replaced. The system would automatically adjust the grind settings to compensate for the worn burrs, ensuring that the user continues to receive high-quality coffee.",
    "**Coffee Grinder with Voice-Controlled Brewing**: Design a coffee grinder that integrates with popular voice assistants, such as Alexa or Google Assistant, allowing users to control the brewing process using voice commands. The grinder would have a built-in speaker and microphone, enabling users to start, stop, and adjust the brewing process using simple voice commands."
