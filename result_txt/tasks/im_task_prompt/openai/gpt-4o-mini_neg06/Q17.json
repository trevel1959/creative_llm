    "**Self-Cleaning Drum**: Develop a washing machine with a self-cleaning drum feature that uses a combination of steam and UV light to sanitize the interior after each wash cycle. This would eliminate the buildup of mold, mildew, and detergent residue, ensuring that clothes come out cleaner and fresher while reducing the need for manual cleaning of the machine.",
    "**Eco-Friendly Wash Cycle**: Create a wash cycle specifically designed for eco-conscious consumers that uses minimal water and energy while still providing effective cleaning. This cycle would use a combination of ultrasonic waves and eco-friendly detergents that can break down stains and odors without harming the environment. Users could track their water and energy savings through a connected app.",
    "**Multi-Function Fold and Dry**: Innovate a washing machine that not only washes but also folds and dries clothes. After the wash cycle, the machine would transfer clothes to a folding compartment where robotic arms would neatly fold garments. This would save time and effort for users, providing a seamless laundry experience from wash to wear.",
    "**Personalized Wash Profiles**: Implement a feature that allows users to create personalized wash profiles for different clothing items or family members. By inputting preferences such as fragrance intensity, softness, and wash duration, the machine would tailor each wash to meet individual needs, ensuring satisfaction for every user in the household.",
    "**Noise-Canceling Technology**: Introduce noise-canceling technology into washing machines, similar to that used in high-end headphones. This would involve sound-dampening materials and active noise control systems that minimize the sound of the machine during operation, making it more suitable for homes where noise is a concern, such as apartments or during nighttime washes."
