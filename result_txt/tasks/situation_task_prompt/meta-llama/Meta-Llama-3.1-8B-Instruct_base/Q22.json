    "**Sky Pod Network**: Imagine a network of interconnected, transparent, and lightweight sky pods that crisscross the city. These pods are propelled by advanced magnetic levitation technology, allowing for smooth and quiet transportation. Each pod is equipped with a sophisticated navigation system, ensuring efficient and safe travel. The sky pods are also designed to be modular, enabling easy expansion or reconfiguration as needed. To access the pods, citizens use a seamless, augmented reality interface that guides them to the nearest pod and allocates a seat in real-time. The sky pods would be a sustainable, high-tech solution for navigating the city without roads.",
    "**Subterranean Transportation Tunnels**: In the absence of roads, the city's infrastructure would be repurposed to create a comprehensive network of subterranean transportation tunnels. These tunnels would be designed to be energy-efficient, with advanced ventilation systems and climate control. Citizens would travel through the tunnels via sleek, driverless vehicles that utilize advanced navigation and AI to ensure safe and efficient travel. The tunnels would also be equipped with interactive information displays, providing real-time updates on traffic, weather, and local events. To access the tunnels, citizens would use a convenient, wearable device that tracks their location and allocates a vehicle in real-time.",
    "**Waterborne Transportation**: With roads gone, the city's waterways would become the primary mode of transportation. Citizens would travel on sleek, electric boats that navigate through a network of canals, rivers, and lakes. The boats would be designed for comfort and efficiency, with advanced propulsion systems and comfortable seating areas. To access the waterborne transportation system, citizens would use a smart, wearable device that tracks their location and allocates a boat in real-time. The waterborne system would also include a network of floating docks and transfer stations, allowing citizens to easily transition between boats and other modes of transportation.",
    "**Personal Aerial Vehicles (PAVs)**: In a world without roads, Personal Aerial Vehicles (PAVs) would become the primary mode of transportation. These vehicles would be designed for individual use, with advanced navigation and safety features. Citizens would use a wearable device to summon a PAV, which would be dispatched to their location via a network of aerial drones. The PAVs would be equipped with advanced propulsion systems, ensuring safe and efficient travel. To ensure safe operation, the PAVs would be equipped with AI-powered collision avoidance systems and real-time traffic monitoring.",
