    "Virtual Reality Cinema: With the disappearance of movies and theatres, virtual reality technology could be used to create an immersive cinematic experience. Users could put on a VR headset and be transported to a virtual movie theatre where they can watch movies in a 360-degree environment. This would allow people to experience the movies as if they were actually there, with the added bonus of being able to interact with the environment and characters.",
    "Drive-in Theatres: Another option for creating a cinematic experience without traditional theatres would be to establish drive-in theatres. People could watch movies from the comfort of their own cars, with large screens set up in a parking lot. This would allow for a more relaxed and casual movie-going experience, while still providing the thrill of watching a movie on a big screen.",
    "Pop-up Theatres: Pop-up theatres could be set up in various locations around the city, such as parks or public spaces. These theatres could be made from portable materials, such as tents or trailers, and could be set up for a specific period of time. This would allow people to experience the magic of a movie theatre in a unique and unexpected location.",
    "Outdoor Screenings: Outdoor screenings could be set up in parks or other public spaces, using large screens and projectors. This would allow people to watch movies under the stars, with the added bonus of being able to enjoy the fresh air and beautiful scenery.",
    "Interactive Movies: Interactive movies could be created that allow viewers to make choices that affect the outcome of the story. This would allow for a more personal and engaging movie-going experience, as viewers would feel like they have a direct impact on the story. This could be done through the use of technology, such as smartphones or tablets, that allow viewers to vote on different storylines and see the consequences of their choices in real-time."
