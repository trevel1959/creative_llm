    "**Global Cooperation on a Larger Scale**: With all world leaders being women, the dynamics of international relations would shift significantly. Women are generally more collaborative and communicative, which could lead to a more cooperative and less confrontational approach to global politics. This, in turn, might result in more effective solutions to pressing global issues like climate change, economic inequality, and social injustice. Women leaders would be more likely to prioritize diplomacy and dialogue over aggression and competition, fostering a more peaceful and stable world.",
    "**Increased Focus on Social and Environmental Issues**: Historically, women have been at the forefront of social and environmental movements. If all world leaders were women, they would likely prioritize these issues, leading to more significant progress in areas like women's rights, education, healthcare, and environmental protection. This could result in more comprehensive policies addressing the needs of marginalized communities and the planet as a whole.",
    "**More Emphasis on Emotional Intelligence and Empathy**: Women are often more attuned to the emotional needs of others, which could lead to more empathetic and compassionate decision-making. This might result in policies that prioritize the well-being of citizens, rather than just economic growth or political power. World leaders would be more likely to listen to diverse perspectives, consider the long-term consequences of their actions, and make decisions that benefit the greater good.",
    "**A Shift in Priorities from Military Spending to Human Development**: Women leaders might redirect resources from military spending to areas like education, healthcare, and infrastructure development. This could lead to significant improvements in the quality of life for citizens, particularly in areas with limited resources. By investing in human development, women leaders would be more likely to create a more equitable and prosperous world.",
    "**A More Holistic Approach to Economic Development**: Women often consider the social and environmental implications of economic decisions, which could lead to more sustainable and equitable economic policies. They might prioritize local and community-based development over large-scale industrialization, focusing on creating opportunities for small businesses, cooperatives, and social enterprises. This could result in more resilient and adaptable economies that benefit a wider range of people."
