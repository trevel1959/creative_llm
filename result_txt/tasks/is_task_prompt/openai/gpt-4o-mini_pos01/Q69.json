    "In a quaint village, there lived a boy named Eli who had a peculiar gift: he could taste words. Every time someone spoke, the flavors danced on his tongue. Sweet words like “love” tasted like honey, while harsh words like “hate” were bitter and sour. Eli often shared his experiences with the townsfolk, encouraging them to choose their words wisely. One day, a stranger arrived, spewing venomous insults. Eli tasted the bitterness and, with a brave heart, spoke back with kindness. To his surprise, the stranger's words transformed into a warm chocolate, melting away his anger. From that day on, the village thrived on the sweetness of words. ",
