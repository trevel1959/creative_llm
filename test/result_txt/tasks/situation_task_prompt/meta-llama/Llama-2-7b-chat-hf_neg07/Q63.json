    "Biometric Key Fobs: Develop biometric key fobs that utilize fingerprint or facial recognition technology to unlock doors and devices. These fobs would eliminate the need for physical keys and provide an additional layer of security.",
    "Smart Locks with AI Integration: Install smart locks that can be controlled through an AI-powered app. The app can detect and recognize familiar faces, allowing for secure entry without the need for physical keys. The AI can also learn and adapt to the user's habits and preferences, ensuring a seamless and secure experience.",
    "Personalized Quantum Codes: Generate unique quantum codes for each individual, which would be impossible to replicate or hack. These codes could be used to unlock devices, access secure locations, or even verify identities.",
    "Invisible Ink and Hidden Sensors: Develop invisible ink that can only be detected by specific wavelengths of light, and use it to mark sensitive areas such as documents or valuables. Hidden sensors can also be installed in these areas to detect any unauthorized access or tampering.",
    "DNA-Based Security Systems: Create a security system that uses DNA recognition to verify identities and grant access. This system would be virtually impossible to hack or replicate, providing a highly secure solution for sensitive areas or items."
