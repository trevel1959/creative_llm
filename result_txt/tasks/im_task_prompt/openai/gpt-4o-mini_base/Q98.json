    "**Self-Cleaning Mechanism**: A juicer that features a self-cleaning mode could significantly reduce the hassle of cleanup. After juicing, users can simply press a button, and the juicer will run a series of rinsing cycles using water and a cleaning solution, effectively removing pulp and residue. This would save time and encourage more frequent use of the juicer.",
    "**Modular Design for Customization**: A juicer with a modular design could allow users to swap out different components based on their juicing needs. For instance, users could have attachments for different types of produce (citrus, leafy greens, hard vegetables) or even for making nut milk or smoothies. This versatility would cater to a wider audience and make the juicer a more valuable kitchen tool.",
    "**Eco-Friendly Materials and Energy Efficiency**: Developing a juicer made from sustainable materials, such as bamboo or recycled plastics, would appeal to environmentally conscious consumers. Additionally, incorporating energy-efficient motors and features like an automatic shut-off after use could further enhance its eco-friendliness and reduce energy consumption.",
    "**Built-In Storage for Ingredients**: A juicer that includes a small compartment for storing fruits and vegetables would streamline the juicing process. Users could load their ingredients directly into the juicer, keeping them fresh and ready for use. This would be especially useful for those with limited kitchen space or who want to keep their juicing ingredients organized.",
    "**Personalized Nutritional Feedback**: By integrating a small scale and a simple AI system, the juicer could analyze the ingredients being used and provide personalized nutritional feedback. For example, it could suggest adding more vitamin-rich fruits or vegetables based on the userâ€™s dietary goals. This feature would make the juicer not just a kitchen appliance but a health and wellness assistant."
