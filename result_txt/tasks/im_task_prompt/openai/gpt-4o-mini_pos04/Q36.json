    "**Multi-Functional Blade with Interchangeable Heads**: Instead of a single blade, this knife would come with a base handle that allows users to swap out different blade heads for various functionsâ€”chef's knife, serrated bread knife, paring knife, etc. Each blade could be designed for specific tasks, and a magnetic or locking mechanism would ensure they stay securely in place during use.",
    "**Self-Sharpening Knife Technology**: This knife would incorporate a self-sharpening mechanism that utilizes ceramic or diamond-coated surfaces to keep the blade sharp with each use. The mechanism could be activated with a simple button or even be automatic, ensuring that the knife maintains its edge without the need for manual sharpening, thus enhancing user safety and convenience.",
    "**Ergonomically Designed Handle with Customizable Grip**: The handle of the knife could be designed with a modular grip system that allows users to customize the shape and texture based on their comfort and hand size. This could include adjustable features like removable padding, different grip angles, and even temperature-sensitive materials that provide a better grip when wet or slippery.",
    "**Eco-Friendly, Biodegradable Knife**: To address environmental concerns, this knife could be made from sustainable materials that are both durable and biodegradable. The handle could be crafted from a composite of recycled materials and natural fibers, while the blade could be made from plant-based bioplastics. This would appeal to eco-conscious consumers looking for sustainable kitchen tools.",
    "**Knife with Built-In Safety Features**: This innovative knife could feature a retractable blade that automatically pulls back when not in use, preventing accidental cuts. Additionally, it could have a safety lock mechanism that requires a specific motion or button press to unlock the blade, ensuring that children or inexperienced users cannot access the sharp edge easily."
