    "**Underground Tunnels**: If all roads disappeared, underground tunnels could be constructed to serve as a means of transportation. These tunnels could be designed to accommodate various types of vehicles, from cars to bicycles, and could be equipped with advanced safety features to ensure smooth and secure travel. The tunnels could also be connected to an extensive network of public transportation, such as trains and buses, to provide seamless connectivity throughout the city.",
    "**Skywalks and Pedestrian Bridges**: In the absence of roads, skywalks and pedestrian bridges could be built to span across the town or city. These structures could be made of durable materials, such as steel or concrete, and would allow people to walk from one point to another without the need for vehicles. They could also be designed with various amenities, such as shops and restaurants, to create a vibrant and bustling atmosphere.",
    "**Hovercrafts**: Hovercrafts, which are vehicles that float on a cushion of air, could be used to move around a town or city without roads. These vehicles could be adapted to accommodate passengers or cargo, and could be designed to travel at high speeds, allowing for efficient transportation.",
    "**Rail-based Transportation**: In a world without roads, rail-based transportation systems, such as trams or light rail, could be expanded to cover a larger area of the town or city. These systems could be designed to run on rails embedded in the ground, allowing for smooth and efficient travel. They could also be integrated with other modes of transportation, such as buses or bicycles, to provide a comprehensive network of travel options.",
    "**Aquatic Transportation**: If all roads disappeared, aquatic transportation could be a viable solution. This could include boats or water taxis, which could be used to travel across rivers, lakes, or other bodies of water. These vehicles could be designed to accommodate passengers or cargo, and could be powered by electric motors or other environmentally friendly technologies."
