    "**Skywalk Network**: In a world without roads, I'd propose the creation of a skywalk network – a system of elevated walkways, pedestrian bridges, and ziplines that crisscross the city. This network would allow residents to navigate the urban landscape with ease, using a combination of stairs, elevators, and pulleys to traverse the skywalks. Each skywalk would be designed with safety features, such as railings, nets, and emergency landing platforms, to ensure a secure and enjoyable experience. The skywalk network would also incorporate public art installations, green spaces, and community areas, making it a unique and vibrant part of the city's infrastructure.",
    "**Aerial Taxis**: To facilitate transportation within the city, I'd introduce aerial taxis – small, electric-powered drones that can transport individuals or small groups. These taxis would be equipped with safety features, such as GPS tracking, collision avoidance systems, and emergency parachutes. They would operate on a network of designated air corridors, ensuring efficient and safe travel. Aerial taxis would be an eco-friendly alternative to traditional transportation methods, reducing congestion and pollution in the city.",
    "**Waterways**: In a world without roads, I'd explore the possibility of using waterways as a primary mode of transportation. The city would be designed with a network of canals, rivers, and lakes, allowing residents to travel by boat or kayak. This would not only provide a unique and scenic way to navigate the city but also promote sustainable and eco-friendly transportation. Water taxis and ferries would be introduced to connect different parts of the city, making it easy to get around without the need for roads.",
    "**Personal Mobility Devices**: To address the need for individual transportation, I'd develop a range of personal mobility devices – wearable technology that allows people to move around the city with ease. These devices would be equipped with advanced sensors, AI-powered navigation, and safety features, ensuring a smooth and secure experience. Personal mobility devices would come in various forms, such as exoskeletons, hoverboards, or wearable wings, allowing individuals to choose the mode of transportation that suits their needs and preferences.",
    "**Underground Transportation**: In a world without roads, I'd propose the development of an extensive underground transportation system – a network of tunnels and subterranean routes that crisscross the city. This system would be designed for both pedestrian and vehicular traffic, using advanced technologies such as vacuum tube transportation, hyperloops, or magnetic levitation"
