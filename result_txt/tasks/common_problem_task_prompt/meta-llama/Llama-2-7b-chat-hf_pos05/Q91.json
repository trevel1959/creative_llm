    "Community-Led Rainwater Harvesting Program: Create a program that empowers local communities to collect and store rainwater for drinking, cooking, and hygiene purposes. Train community members in water harvesting techniques, such as constructing rainwater collection systems, and provide them with the necessary materials. This approach not only provides clean water but also promotes sustainability and community ownership.",
    "Mobile Water Filtration Units: Develop portable water filtration units that can be transported to remote areas, providing clean drinking water to communities without access to safe water sources. These units can be powered by solar energy and can filter water using innovative technologies, such as ceramic filters or ultraviolet light disinfection.",
    "Waste-to-Water Treatment Systems: Design and implement waste-to-water treatment systems that convert waste from households, businesses, and industries into clean water. This approach not only provides clean water but also reduces the amount of waste accumulating in landfills and minimizes the environmental impact of waste disposal.",
    "Floating Water Purification Systems: Develop floating water purification systems that can be deployed on water bodies, such as lakes, rivers, or oceans. These systems can use innovative technologies, such as membrane filtration or ultraviolet light disinfection, to purify water, making it safe for drinking and other uses.",
    "Community-Based Aquaponics: Create community-based aquaponics systems that integrate fish farming and hydroponics to produce both food and clean water. These systems can be designed to be sustainable, using recirculating systems and organic fertilizers, and can provide a reliable source of clean water for local communities."
