    "**Smart Trash Can**: Design a smart trash can that uses AI technology to identify recyclable items, sort them, and even separate organic waste for composting. It could be equipped with sensors that detect when the can is full or when certain types of waste are running low, sending notifications to the user's phone or a central system. This idea not only promotes recycling but also reduces landfill waste.",
    "**Trash Can as a Social Media Platform**: Create an interactive trash can that allows people to post their messages on the sides or top. Users can write messages, thoughts, or drawings, which can then be shared through social media platforms. This can create a community where people can express themselves in public spaces without the fear of judgment. The trash can could also track its location using GPS, creating a real-time map of messages being shared across different locations.",
    "**Recycling Art Project**: Develop a large-scale art installation made entirely from recycled materials, with a trash can at the center. People can deposit their recyclables into the can, and as they do so, the can feeds these materials into the installation, which is continuously created and reshaped by a team of artists. This project would visually demonstrate the transformation of waste into art, promoting the concept of upcycling.",
    "**Eco-friendly Trash Can with Biodegradable Liners**: Design a trash can with biodegradable liners made from plant-based materials like cornstarch or potato starch. These liners would degrade much faster than traditional plastic ones, reducing environmental impact. The trash can could be made from recycled materials, and the entire product could be designed with minimal environmental footprint, including the packaging.",
    "**Educational Trash Can**: Build a trash can that incorporates educational elements. It could have QR codes or NFC tags on each section of the can, linking to information about the items being discarded. Users could scan these codes to learn about the impact of their waste, proper recycling methods, or the benefits of reducing waste. This can be particularly effective in schools or community centers to educate people on sustainable waste management practices."
