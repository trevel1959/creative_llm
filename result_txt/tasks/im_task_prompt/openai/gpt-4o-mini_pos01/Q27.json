    "**Smart Shower Head with Water Usage Tracker**: Develop a smart shower head that connects to a mobile app to monitor water usage in real-time. The app can provide insights into water consumption, suggest optimal shower durations, and even gamify water conservation by rewarding users for reduced usage with discounts on water bills or eco-friendly products.",
    "**Aromatherapy Diffuser**: Incorporate a small compartment in the shower head that allows users to insert essential oil capsules. When the shower is turned on, the water will mix with the essential oils, releasing soothing scents like lavender or eucalyptus. This feature can enhance the shower experience, making it not just a cleansing ritual but also a relaxing spa-like experience.",
    "**Adjustable Water Pressure and Pattern Settings**: Design a shower head that allows users to customize water pressure and spray patterns with a simple twist or tap. Users can choose from options like a gentle mist, a powerful massage, or a concentrated jet, depending on their mood or needs at the moment. This could be achieved with a built-in dial or a touch-sensitive interface.",
    "**Eco-Friendly Water Filtration System**: Create a shower head that includes a built-in water filtration system to remove chlorine and other impurities from tap water. This would not only improve skin and hair health but also provide a more pleasant shower experience. The filtration cartridges could be easily replaceable, promoting sustainability.",
    "**Sound Therapy Integration**: Incorporate small speakers into the shower head that can play soothing sounds, music, or nature sounds. Users can connect their devices via Bluetooth to play their favorite playlists or choose from pre-loaded calming soundscapes. This would turn a regular shower into a multi-sensory experience."
