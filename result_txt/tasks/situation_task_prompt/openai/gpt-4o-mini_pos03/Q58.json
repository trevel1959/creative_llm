    "**Smart Insect Deterrents**: Develop a smart pest management system that uses sensors to detect insect presence and automatically releases non-toxic deterrents or repellents, such as essential oils. These systems could be connected to a smartphone app, allowing users to monitor pest activity and adjust settings based on real-time data, reducing the need for harmful chemicals.",
    "**Eco-Friendly Microbial Solutions**: Research and develop microbial solutions that specifically target pest populations without harming beneficial organisms. These could be bacteria or fungi that disrupt the life cycles of pests, effectively controlling their numbers while promoting biodiversity. This approach would be similar to how certain microbes can be used to combat specific agricultural pests.",
    "**Insect-Safe Gardens**: Create urban gardens designed to attract beneficial insects like pollinators and predatory insects that naturally control pest populations. By planting a diverse array of native plants, these gardens would provide habitats and food sources for beneficial insects, which would help maintain a balanced ecosystem in the absence of larger animals.",
    "**Automated Insect Collectors**: Design and deploy robotic insect collectors that can roam residential and agricultural areas. These robots would be equipped with advanced vision systems to identify and capture pests, sorting them into compartments based on species. This approach would minimize the use of pesticides while actively managing pest populations.",
    "**Pest-Repellent Fabrics**: Innovate textiles that incorporate natural insect-repelling properties, such as infused essential oils or plant extracts. These fabrics could be used in clothing, home textiles, and outdoor gear, providing a physical barrier against pests without the need for chemical repellents. This would be especially useful for outdoor activities in pest-prone areas."
