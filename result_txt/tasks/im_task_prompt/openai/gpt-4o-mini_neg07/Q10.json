    "**Modular Design**: Create a laptop with a modular design that allows users to easily upgrade or replace components such as the RAM, battery, storage, and even the display. This would not only extend the lifespan of the device but also reduce electronic waste. Users could customize their laptops according to their specific needs, such as enhancing gaming performance or improving battery life for travel.",
    "**Integrated Health Monitoring**: Equip laptops with sensors that can monitor the user's health metrics such as heart rate, posture, and stress levels. By analyzing this data, the laptop could provide real-time feedback and reminders to take breaks, adjust posture, or practice mindfulness exercises. This feature would promote a healthier work environment, especially for those who spend long hours in front of screens.",
    "**Holographic Display Option**: Develop a laptop with an optional holographic display feature that allows users to project 3D holograms of their work. This would be particularly useful for designers, architects, and engineers who need to visualize complex models. The holographic interface could also facilitate collaborative work, allowing multiple users to interact with the same 3D model from different angles.",
    "**Eco-Friendly Materials**: Innovate laptops made from sustainable materials such as recycled plastics, bamboo, or biodegradable composites. This would not only reduce the environmental impact of laptop production but also appeal to eco-conscious consumers. Additionally, the packaging could be designed to be reusable or compostable, further enhancing the sustainability aspect.",
    "**AI-Powered Personal Assistant**: Integrate a more advanced AI assistant that learns the user's habits and preferences over time. This assistant could proactively manage tasks, schedule meetings, and provide personalized suggestions for productivity based on the user's workflow. For example, it could analyze email patterns and suggest optimal times for responding or remind users of deadlines in a more intuitive manner."
