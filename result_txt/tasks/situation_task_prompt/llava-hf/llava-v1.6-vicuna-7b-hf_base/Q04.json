    "Urban Agriculture: Another solution is to promote urban agriculture. By growing food and other resources in cities, we can reduce our reliance on distant sources of supply. This can be achieved through rooftop gardens, community gardens, and other forms of urban farming.",
    "Biomimicry: Biomimicry is the practice of designing products, processes, and systems that mimic nature. By studying natural systems and processes, we can learn how to create sustainable and efficient solutions to replace lost resources. For example, we can design buildings that mimic the insulating properties of termite mounds or create materials that mimic the strength and lightweight properties of spider silk.",
    "Carbon Capture and Storage: Carbon capture and storage (CCS) is a technology that captures carbon dioxide from power plants and other industrial sources and stores it underground. This can help reduce greenhouse gas emissions and mitigate climate change. By investing in CCS technology, we can reduce our reliance on fossil fuels and replace lost natural resources.",
    "Renewable Energy: Another solution is to invest in renewable energy sources, such as solar, wind, and hydroelectric power. By transitioning to renewable energy, we can reduce our reliance on fossil fuels and mitigate climate change. This can also help reduce the demand for resources such as oil and gas.",
    "Circular Economy: A circular economy is an economic system that is designed to be regenerative and restorative. By designing products and systems that can be reused, repaired, and recycled, we can reduce waste and extend the life of resources. This can help replace lost natural resources by reducing demand for virgin materials."
