    "A Spatula for Artistic Cooking: Create a spatula that doubles as a paintbrush, allowing chefs to add artistic touches to their dishes. The spatula would have a detachable brush head that can be used to apply sauces, glazes, or even paint-like ingredients onto food. This would allow chefs to create visually appealing dishes that are not only delicious but also Instagram-worthy.",
    "A Spatula for the Modern Kitchen: Design a spatula with a built-in scale, allowing users to measure ingredients directly on the spatula. This would eliminate the need for a separate measuring device, making cooking easier and more efficient. The spatula could also have a built-in timer, so users can easily track the cooking time of their dishes.",
    "A Spatula for Food Safety: Create a spatula with a built-in UV light, which would help to kill bacteria and other microorganisms on food surfaces. This would ensure that food is safe to eat and reduce the risk of food poisoning. The UV light could be powered by a small battery or even a solar panel, making it a convenient and eco-friendly option.",
    "A Spatula for Outdoor Cooking: Design a spatula specifically for outdoor cooking, such as camping or grilling. The spatula would have a durable, heat-resistant handle and a non-stick head that can withstand high temperatures. It could also have a built-in bottle opener, making it easy to open beer or other drinks while cooking outdoors.",
    "A Spatula for Special Diets: Create a spatula that caters to specific dietary needs, such as gluten-free, vegan, or vegetarian. The spatula could be made with non-toxic, allergen-free materials and have a detachable head that can be easily cleaned and replaced. This would make it easy for people with dietary restrictions to cook and prepare meals without worrying about cross-contamination or allergic reactions."
