    "Glowing Bioluminescence: The new plant species, named \"Luminaris,\" would have the ability to produce light through bioluminescence, similar to fireflies or glowworms. This would allow it to thrive in low-light environments, providing a unique and striking visual display.",
    "Adaptive Shape-Shifting: The plant, known as \"Flexica,\" would have the ability to change its shape and structure in response to its environment. For example, it could flatten itself to absorb more sunlight or grow longer tendrils to reach water sources. This adaptability would allow it to survive in a wide range of ecosystems.",
    "Air Purification: The new plant species, called \"Aerthrive,\" would have specialized leaves that could absorb and break down harmful pollutants in the air, such as carbon dioxide and volatile organic compounds. This would make it an ideal plant for urban environments, where air quality is often poor.",
    "Underground Water Storage: The plant, named \"Hydroria,\" would have extensive underground root systems that could store water, allowing it to survive in arid environments where other plants might struggle to find moisture. This would also make it an important source of fresh water for other organisms.",
    "Seismic Resilience: The plant, known as \"TerraQuake,\" would have a unique cellular structure that would allow it to withstand even the most intense earthquakes. Its cells would be able to absorb and dissipate seismic energy, protecting the plant from damage. This would make it an ideal plant for areas prone to seismic activity."
