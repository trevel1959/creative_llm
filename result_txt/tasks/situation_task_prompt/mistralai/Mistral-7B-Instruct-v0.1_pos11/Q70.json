    "Use natural light: Without watches and clocks, we would have to rely on natural light to determine the time of day. We could schedule our day based on the position of the sun in the sky, using the rising and setting of the sun as our guide.",
    "Use the moon: We could also use the moon to schedule our day. We could observe the phases of the moon and use them to divide our day into segments. For example, we could use the first quarter of the moon to mark the beginning of the day, the full moon to mark the midpoint, and the third quarter of the moon to mark the end of the day.",
    "Use the stars: We could also use the stars to schedule our day. We could observe the position of certain stars and use them to mark the beginning and end of the day. For example, we could use the star Sirius to mark the beginning of the day and the star Arcturus to mark the end of the day.",
    "Use the wind: We could also use the wind to schedule our day. We could observe the direction and strength of the wind and use it to mark the beginning and end of the day. For example, we could use the rising of the wind to mark the beginning of the day and the falling of the wind to mark the end of the day.",
    "Use the earth's movements: We could also use the earth's movements to schedule our day. We could observe the movements of the earth's tides and use them to mark the beginning and end of the day. For example, we could use the rising of the tide to mark the beginning of the day and the falling of the tide to mark the end of the day."
