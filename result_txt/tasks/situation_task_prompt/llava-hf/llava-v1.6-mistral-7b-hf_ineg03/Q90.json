    "Rainwater Harvesting: In this approach, a building or structure is designed to collect and store rainwater. This can be done by installing gutters and downspouts to direct water into a storage tank or by creating a swale or berm around the property to collect water runoff.",
    "Desalination: Desalination is the process of removing salt and other minerals from seawater to make it drinkable. This can be done using reverse osmosis, which forces water through a semipermeable membrane, or by using a multi-stage flash distillation system. While more complex and expensive than other methods, desalination can provide a reliable source of water in areas with limited freshwater supplies.",
    "Water Boreholes: Water boreholes are deep holes drilled into the ground to access underground water sources. A pump is used to bring the water to the surface, where it can be filtered and treated before consumption. This method is commonly used in rural areas and can be a sustainable way to access water in areas with reliable water tables.",
    "Aquaponics: Aquaponics is a system that combines hydroponics (growing plants in water) with aquaculture (raising fish in water). The water used in the system is continuously circulated and filtered, allowing for the efficient use of water resources. This method can be used to grow both food and water in a closed-loop system.",
    "Greywater Recycling: Greywater recycling involves capturing and treating the wastewater from showers, sinks, and washing machines, and reusing it for irrigation or flushing toilets. This method can significantly reduce the demand for fresh water and is an effective way to conserve resources in areas with limited water supplies."
