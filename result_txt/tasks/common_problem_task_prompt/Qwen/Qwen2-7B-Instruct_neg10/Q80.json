    "**Sustainable Transportation Initiative**: Another innovative solution could be to encourage guests to use public transportation, carpool, or bike to the venue. This not only reduces carbon emissions but also promotes a healthy lifestyle. The couple could offer incentives such as free public transport tickets or bike-sharing services to encourage guests to participate.",
    "**Eco-Friendly Menu Options**: Instead of serving traditional wedding fare, the couple could opt for a menu that includes locally-sourced, seasonal, and plant-based dishes. This approach minimizes environmental impact by reducing the need for long-distance transportation of ingredients and supports local farmers who might use more sustainable farming practices.",
    "**Zero-Waste Ceremony Setup**: Designing the ceremony space to be completely zero-waste is another creative way to tackle the issue of waste production. This could involve using biodegradable decorations, digital invitations, and compostable tableware. Couples could also consider hosting a post-wedding cleanup event where they collect any remaining waste and ensure it's disposed of responsibly.",
    "**Eco-Friendly Wedding Attire**: Encouraging the use of sustainable fabrics like organic cotton, linen, or recycled materials for wedding attire is a great way to minimize the environmental impact. Couples could also consider renting clothes instead of buying new ones, which helps reduce textile waste and the resources required for production.",
    "**Digital Guest Book**: Traditional guest books can take up a lot of space and contribute to paper waste. A digital guest book offers a modern alternative where guests can leave messages online. This not only saves paper but also encourages digital communication, which can help reduce energy consumption associated with printing and mailing."
