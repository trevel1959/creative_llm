    "**Truthful Relationships**: I would apply this ability to improve personal relationships. Imagine a world where couples, friends, and family members could only express their genuine feelings and thoughts. This could eliminate misunderstandings and build stronger bonds. For example, during a couple's therapy session, both partners would be compelled to share their true feelings about each other, leading to deeper insights and resolutions to conflicts that might otherwise fester.",
    "**Uncovering Historical Truths**: I would utilize this power to investigate historical events that remain shrouded in mystery or controversy. By compelling key figures, historians, or witnesses to reveal the truth about events like political assassinations or cover-ups, we could rewrite history with factual accuracy. This could lead to a deeper understanding of our past and potentially heal societal rifts caused by misinformation or historical grievances.",
    "**Truth in Advertising**: In the marketing and advertising industry, I would use this power to ensure that all advertisements are truthful. Companies would be required to disclose the actual effectiveness of their products and any potential side effects or drawbacks. This would not only protect consumers from misleading claims but also encourage companies to innovate genuinely beneficial products rather than relying on exaggeration or deception.",
    "**Justice System Reformation**: I would implement this ability within the justice system to ensure that all testimonies and evidence presented in court are truthful. This could help eliminate wrongful convictions and ensure that justice is served fairly. For example, during trials, witnesses and defendants would be compelled to speak the truth, leading to a more accurate representation of events and potentially saving innocent lives from being imprisoned.",
    "**Political Transparency**: I would apply this power to political campaigns and governance. Politicians would be required to tell the truth about their policies, funding sources, and intentions. This could lead to a more informed electorate and reduce the prevalence of political corruption and manipulation. For instance, during election debates, candidates would have to answer questions honestly, providing voters with a clearer understanding of who they are electing."
