    "Reduced energy consumption: If humans could hibernate, they would not need to consume as much energy to maintain their body temperature and metabolism, as they would be able to slow down their metabolic processes during hibernation. This could lead to a significant reduction in energy consumption and greenhouse gas emissions, which could help combat climate change. Confidence score: 0.8",
    "Increased lifespan: Hibernation can slow down the aging process, as it allows the body to repair and regenerate cells more efficiently. If humans could hibernate, they may be able to increase their lifespan and live healthier, more productive lives. Confidence score: 0.9",
