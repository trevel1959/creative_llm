    "**Zoning and Building Regulations**: Tiny houses often face challenges related to local zoning laws and building codes. Some areas may not allow tiny homes to be placed on certain types of land, or there may be restrictions on size, height, or materials. This can limit design options and necessitate additional research and adjustments to the plans, potentially delaying the project or increasing costs.",
    "**Sustainability Concerns**: While tiny houses are often marketed as eco-friendly living solutions, ensuring that the design is genuinely sustainable can be tricky. Problems can arise when selecting materials that are both stylish and environmentally responsible. For instance, opting for reclaimed wood might offer aesthetic appeal but could also come with hidden costs in terms of labor and potential structural integrity issues.",
    "**Heating and Cooling Efficiency**: Tiny houses often have unique heating and cooling needs due to their small size and design. A common problem is ensuring that the space is comfortable year-round without over-relying on energy-intensive systems. Creative solutions might include integrating passive solar design, strategically placed windows for cross-ventilation, or even installing a green roof to enhance insulation and reduce energy costs.",
    "**Limited Natural Light**: A stylish tiny house design often incorporates large windows or skylights to create an illusion of space and enhance aesthetics. However, the potential problem here is privacy and heat gain. Too many windows can lead to a lack of privacy or overheating in the summer months. Solutions could include using smart glass technology that adjusts transparency or incorporating window treatments that maintain privacy while allowing light in.",
    "**Storage Solutions**: In a tiny house, finding adequate storage can be a significant challenge. A common problem is designing storage that is both accessible and visually appealing. For example, under-bed storage can be effective, but it might require complex mechanisms to access. Creative solutions could involve built-in cabinetry that matches the overall design aesthetic or using vertical space with shelving that adds character to the walls."
