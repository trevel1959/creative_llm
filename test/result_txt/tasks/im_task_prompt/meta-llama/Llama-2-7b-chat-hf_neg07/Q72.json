    "Surfboard for people with disabilities: Create a surfboard designed specifically for individuals with physical disabilities, such as those with spinal cord injuries, muscular dystrophy, or amputations. This surfboard would be adapted to accommodate their needs, providing a sense of independence and freedom in the water. The board could have a special harness system to secure the rider, and a padded area for support and balance.",
    "Solar-powered surfboard: Design a surfboard that harnesses the power of the sun to generate electricity, providing a sustainable and eco-friendly way to enjoy the water. The board could have a built-in solar panel that captures sunlight and converts it into electricity, which could be used to power an electric motor or other devices. This would allow surfers to surf without contributing to the carbon footprint of their activity.",
    "Interactive surfboard: Create a surfboard that responds to the rider's movements and emotions, providing an immersive and interactive experience. The board could have sensors that detect the rider's body language and movements, and adjust the board's shape, speed, and direction accordingly. The board could also have a built-in sound system that responds to the rider's emotions, creating a unique and personalized experience.",
    "Smart surfboard: Develop a surfboard that uses artificial intelligence and machine learning to optimize the surfing experience. The board could have sensors that detect the surfer's skill level, the wave conditions, and other factors, and adjust its performance accordingly. The board could also have a built-in camera that streams live footage to the rider's wristband or other device, providing real-time feedback and analysis of their surfing technique.",
    "Inflatable surfboard: Design a surfboard that is made of a lightweight and durable inflatable material, making it easy to transport and store. The board could be inflated to different pressures depending on the wave conditions, providing a versatile and customizable surfing experience. The inflatable design would also make the board more buoyant and easier to maneuver, allowing surfers to catch waves and perform tricks with greater ease."
