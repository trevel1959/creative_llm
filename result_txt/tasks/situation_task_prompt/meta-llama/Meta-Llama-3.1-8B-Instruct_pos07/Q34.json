    "**Atmospheric Water Harvester**: Develop a device that captures and condenses water vapor from the air, using advanced nanomaterials and temperature control. This system would be powered by renewable energy sources, ensuring a sustainable and eco-friendly solution. The device would be designed to be compact, efficient, and easy to maintain, making it perfect for indoor and outdoor use.",
    "**Smart Irrigation System**: Design a smart irrigation system that utilizes AI-powered sensors to detect soil moisture levels, temperature, and humidity. This system would adjust watering schedules accordingly, ensuring that plants receive the perfect amount of water at the right time. The system would also integrate with weather forecasts, adjusting watering schedules based on predicted weather conditions.",
    "**Rainwater Harvesting System**: Implement a rainwater harvesting system that collects and stores rainwater from rooftops and other surfaces. The system would feature a network of gutters, downspouts, and storage tanks, allowing for efficient collection and distribution of rainwater to plants. This system would be designed to be low-maintenance, durable, and aesthetically pleasing.",
    "**Drip Irrigation System**: Develop a drip irrigation system that delivers water directly to the roots of plants, reducing evaporation and runoff. The system would feature a network of tubes and emitters, allowing for precise control over water distribution. This system would be designed to be energy-efficient, easy to install, and suitable for a variety of plant species.",
    "**Hydroponic System**: Design a hydroponic system that uses nutrient-rich water to feed plants, eliminating the need for soil. The system would feature a network of pipes, pumps, and sensors, allowing for precise control over water temperature, pH, and nutrient levels. This system would be designed to be energy-efficient, space-saving, and suitable for a variety of plant species. [/INST] "
