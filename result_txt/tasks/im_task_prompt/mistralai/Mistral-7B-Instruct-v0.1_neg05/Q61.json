    "Create a customized calendar for the user that includes their most important events, deadlines, and dates. This calendar can be synced with their phone and email, so they always have access to it.",
    "Use machine learning to analyze the user's past behavior and suggest events or activities that they might be interested in. For example, if the user frequently attends concerts, the calendar could suggest upcoming concerts in their area.",
    "Allow the user to set reminders for specific tasks or events, and send notifications to their phone or email when the reminder is due.",
    "Use natural language processing to understand the user's voice commands and allow them to add events to the calendar or set reminders without having to type.",
    "Create a feature that allows the user to collaborate with others on events or tasks. For example, if two people are planning a trip together, they can add events to the calendar and share it with each other to keep track of their plans."
