    "**Integrated Solar Charging System**: Incorporate lightweight solar panels into the design of the sleeping bag. These panels could be used to charge small devices like phones or lanterns while camping. The bag could also feature a built-in battery pack that stores energy for nighttime use, allowing campers to stay connected even in remote areas.",
    "**Modular Design with Zip-On Components**: Create a modular sleeping bag that allows users to add or remove components based on their needs.

    "**Self-Inflating Mattress Integration**: Combine a sleeping bag with a self-inflating mattress that rolls up together. This would eliminate the need for separate sleeping pads and provide extra comfort. The mattress could be designed to fit perfectly within the sleeping bag, ensuring no cold spots and easy setup for campers.",
    "**Built-In Pillow with Adjustable Firmness**: Introduce a sleeping bag with an integrated pillow that features adjustable firmness settings. This could be achieved with air chambers or memory foam that can be inflated or deflated to suit personal preferences. This would enhance comfort and eliminate the need to carry an extra pillow."
