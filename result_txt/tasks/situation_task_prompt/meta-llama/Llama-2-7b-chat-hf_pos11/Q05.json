    "Solar-Powered Lanterns: Create portable, battery-free lanterns that harness the power of the sun to provide light during the day. These lanterns could be made from translucent materials and have a built-in solar panel that captures sunlight during the day, storing it in a battery for later use.",
    "Light-Emitting Plants: Genetically engineer plants to produce light-emitting compounds, such as bioluminescent plants, to provide a natural source of light during the day. These plants could be integrated into various environments, such as gardens, parks, or even indoor spaces, to create a soft, natural glow.",
    "Sun-Powered Windows: Develop windows that can harness and convert sunlight into electricity, providing a sustainable and renewable source of energy. These windows could be equipped with photovoltaic cells that can convert sunlight into electricity, which could then be stored in a battery or used directly to power devices.",
    "Cloud-Based Lighting: Create a network of cloud-based lighting systems that can be accessed remotely through a smartphone app. These systems could use advanced LED technology to provide bright, uniform lighting, and could be powered by renewable energy sources such as wind or solar power.",
    "Mirror-Based Reflectors: Develop mirror-based reflectors that can concentrate sunlight onto a specific area, providing a concentrated source of light. These reflectors could be used in various settings, such as indoor spaces or outdoor areas with limited natural light, to provide additional lighting. They could be made from materials such as mirrored glass or reflective metals, and could be adjusted to focus sunlight onto a specific area as needed."
