    "Solar Still: A solar still is a device that uses the heat of the sun to distill water from saltwater or contaminated water sources. The solar still consists of two basins, one filled with contaminated water and the other filled with clean water. The solar still uses the heat of the sun to evaporate the water in the contaminated basin, and the resulting steam condenses in the clean basin, leaving behind clean drinking water.",
    "Water Purification Tablets: Water purification tablets are small tablets that can be added to contaminated water to kill bacteria and viruses, making the water safe to drink. These tablets are easy to use and can be stored for an extended period, making them a practical solution for obtaining clean drinking water in emergency situations.",
    "Water Filtration Systems: Water filtration systems can be used to remove contaminants from water sources. These systems use a combination of physical, chemical, and biological processes to remove impurities, including sediment, chemicals, and microorganisms. Water filtration systems can be installed in homes or used in portable form for outdoor activities.",
    "Desalination: Desalination is a process that removes salt and other minerals from seawater to produce clean drinking water. This process can be used to convert seawater into fresh water, but it requires a significant amount of energy and is not practical for individual households.",
    "Water Filtration Plants: Large-scale water filtration plants can be built to purify water from rivers, lakes, or other natural sources. These plants use a combination of physical, chemical, and biological processes to remove contaminants and produce clean drinking water."
