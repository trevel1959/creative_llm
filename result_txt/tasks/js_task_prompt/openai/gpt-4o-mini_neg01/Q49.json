Workshops could be held under its shade, teaching about sustainable practices, gardening, and the importance of trees in combating climate change.",

I would imagine vibrant murals painted on its trunk and branches, reflecting the cultural diversity of the community. This would not only beautify the area but also inspire creativity and artistic expression.",
