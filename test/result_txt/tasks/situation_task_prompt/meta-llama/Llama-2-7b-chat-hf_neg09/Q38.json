For example, baking soda and vinegar are effective cleaning agents that can be used to clean surfaces, while lemons and tea tree oil have antibacterial properties that can be used to disinfect surfaces. By utilizing these natural agents, people could maintain hygiene without relying on manufactured products.",
    "Invent new cleaning technologies: With the absence of soap and cleaning products, inventors and scientists could come up with new cleaning technologies that are more effective and sustainable. For example, a new type of water filtration system could be developed that uses UV light to purify water, or a device that uses nanotechnology to clean surfaces without the need for chemicals. By investing in research and development, new cleaning technologies could be created that are more efficient and environmentally friendly.",
    "Emphasize hand-washing and surface cleaning: Hand-washing and surface cleaning are two of the most effective ways to maintain hygiene without soap and cleaning products. By washing hands regularly and thoroughly, and cleaning surfaces with natural agents or new technologies, people could reduce the risk of infection and illness. Public health campaigns could emphasize the importance of these practices, and provide guidance on how to do them effectively.",
