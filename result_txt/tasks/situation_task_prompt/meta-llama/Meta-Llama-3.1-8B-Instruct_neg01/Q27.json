    "**Solar Window Film**: I'd apply a transparent, thermally insulating film on all windows. This film would absorb and reflect heat from the sun, keeping the room cooler during the day. At night, it would allow heat to escape, reducing the need for artificial heating. The film could be adjusted to optimize its thermal properties based on the time of day and season.",
    "**Phase Change Materials (PCMs)**: I'd integrate PCMs into the building's structure, such as in walls, floors, or ceilings. These materials absorb and release heat energy as they change phase from solid to liquid or vice versa. This would help regulate indoor temperatures by storing excess heat during the day and releasing it at night, or vice versa.",
    "**Ventilation Systems with Evaporative Cooling**: I'd install a ventilation system that incorporates evaporative cooling technology. This system would use the evaporation of water to cool the air, reducing the temperature while also humidifying the air. This method is energy-efficient and can be effective in mild climates.",
    "**Thermal Mass**: I'd use thermal mass elements, such as concrete or brick, to absorb and release heat. These materials have high thermal mass, meaning they can absorb and release heat energy slowly. By placing these elements in strategic locations, such as in walls or floors, I could regulate indoor temperatures by harnessing the natural heat exchange between the building and its surroundings.",
    "**Green Roof with Vegetation**: I'd create a green roof with a variety of plants and vegetation. The plants would provide insulation, reduce urban heat island effects, and absorb carbon dioxide. The vegetation would also help to regulate indoor temperatures by releasing moisture into the air, which would then be cooled through evaporation, creating a natural cooling effect."
