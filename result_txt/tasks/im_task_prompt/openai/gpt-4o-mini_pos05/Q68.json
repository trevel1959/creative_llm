It could also offer explanations for concepts, making it an excellent educational tool for students struggling with math.",
    "**Gamified Learning Mode**:    Incorporate a gamified mode that turns calculations into interactive challenges. Users could solve math problems to progress through levels, earn rewards, or compete against friends. This feature could include fun animations and sound effects to keep users engaged, making math practice feel more like a game than a chore.",
    "**Multi-Function Smart Calculator**:    Create a multi-functional calculator that integrates with various educational apps. It could feature a touch screen that allows users to access graphing tools, statistical analysis, and even coding features. By connecting to online resources, users could easily transition from simple calculations to more complex tasks like programming or data analysis, all within one device.",
    "**Solar-Powered Calculator with Eco-Friendly Materials**:    Design a calculator that runs on solar power and is made from biodegradable materials. This would not only reduce the carbon footprint associated with traditional battery-operated calculators but also appeal to environmentally conscious consumers. The design could include a sleek, modern look with a minimalistic interface, emphasizing sustainability.",
    "**Personalized Learning Profiles**:    Implement a feature that allows users to create personalized learning profiles. The calculator could track progress over time, identify areas where users struggle, and offer tailored practice problems.
