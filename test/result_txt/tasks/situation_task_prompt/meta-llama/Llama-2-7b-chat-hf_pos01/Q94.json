    "Virtual Reality Cinemas: With the disappearance of traditional cinemas, one possible solution would be to create immersive virtual reality (VR) cinemas. Viewers could don VR headsets and be transported into a virtual world where they could watch movies in a fully immersive environment. The VR experience could simulate the feeling of being in a real cinema, complete with a virtual screen, seats, and even smells. Confidence Score: 0.8",
    "Mobile Movie Theatres: Another option would be to create mobile movie theatres that could travel to different locations to bring the cinematic experience to people. These theatres could be set up in parks, squares, or other public spaces, providing a communal viewing experience for those who may not have access to VR technology. The mobile theatres could also showcase classic movies, independent films, or even host film festivals. Confidence Score: 0.7",
    "Interactive Movie Games: In a world without traditional cinemas, people could create their own interactive movie games. These games could be played in a virtual reality setting, where players could interact with the movie by making choices that affect the storyline. Players could also collaborate with others to create their own unique movie experiences. Confidence Score: 0.6",
    "Pop-Up Movie Screens: Another idea would be to create pop-up movie screens in unexpected locations. These screens could be set up in abandoned buildings, rooftops, or even in the middle of parks. The movies could be projected onto the screens using cutting-edge technology, providing a unique and memorable viewing experience. Confidence Score: 0.5",
    "Community Movie Projectors: In a world without cinemas, communities could come together to create their own movie projectors. These projectors could be set up in public spaces, such as community centers, libraries, or parks. The projectors could showcase a variety of movies, including independent films, classic movies, and even community-made content. Confidence Score: 0.4"
