    "**Global Economic Collapse**: The sudden loss of oil would disrupt global supply chains, causing widespread economic instability. Trade would come to a grinding halt, and industries that rely heavily on oil, such as transportation and manufacturing, would be severely impacted. This would lead to widespread unemployment, business closures, and a significant decrease in economic output.",
    "**Rise of Alternative Energy**: The scarcity of oil would accelerate the development and adoption of alternative energy sources, such as solar, wind, and hydrogen power. This would lead to a significant reduction in greenhouse gas emissions and a shift towards more sustainable energy production methods. Governments and corporations would invest heavily in renewable energy infrastructure, creating new job opportunities and stimulating economic growth.",
    "**Global Power Shifts**: The loss of oil would give rise to new global powers, as countries with access to alternative energy sources would gain a strategic advantage. This could lead to a shift in the global balance of power, with countries like Norway, Sweden, and Denmark emerging as leaders in the renewable energy sector. This would also lead to a re-evaluation of international relationships and alliances.",
    "**Mass Migration and Social Unrest**: The economic and social impacts of an oil shortage would lead to widespread migration and social unrest. As people struggle to adapt to a new economic reality, social tensions would rise, and governments would face significant challenges in maintaining order. This could lead to the emergence of new social movements and the redefinition of societal norms.",
    "**Technological Innovation**: The pressure to find alternative energy sources would drive innovation and technological advancements. Scientists and engineers would be pushed to develop new, more efficient energy storage solutions, and the oil shortage would accelerate the development of electric vehicles, advanced materials, and other cutting-edge technologies. This would lead to a new era of scientific discovery and technological progress. "
