    "Create a virtual reality shopping experience where customers can try on clothes and accessories virtually in a 3D environment before making a purchase. This would eliminate the need for physical fitting rooms and allow customers to see how items would look on them before buying.",
    "Introduce a loyalty program that rewards customers for using the shopping cart. Customers could earn points for every purchase, which they could then redeem for discounts or free items.",
    "Develop a feature that allows customers to create customized shopping lists and easily add or remove items as needed. This would make it easier for customers to keep track of what they need and reduce the time spent browsing for items.",
    "Create a feature that suggests complementary products based on the customer's purchase history. For example, if a customer frequently buys running shoes, the shopping cart could suggest other running-related items like sports bras, water bottles, and fitness trackers.",
    "Implement a chatbot that can help customers with their shopping cart questions. The chatbot could answer questions about product availability, shipping options, and returns policies, and could also provide personalized recommendations based on the customer's purchase history."
