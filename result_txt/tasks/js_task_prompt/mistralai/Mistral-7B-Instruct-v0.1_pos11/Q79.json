    "SkyCar: A flying car that can take off and land vertically like a helicopter, and travel at high speeds horizontally like a regular car. It would be powered by electric engines and equipped with safety features like automatic landing and collision avoidance systems. SkyCars could revolutionize transportation in urban areas, reducing traffic congestion and travel times.",
    "Maglev Train: A high-speed train that uses magnetic levitation technology to hover above the tracks, reducing friction and allowing for faster speeds. The train would be powered by clean energy sources like solar or wind power, and would have advanced safety features like automatic emergency braking and collision detection systems.",
    "Hydrofoil Boat: A boat that uses hydrofoil technology to ride above the water, reducing drag and allowing for faster speeds. The boat would be powered by electric engines and equipped with safety features like automatic stabilization and collision avoidance systems. Hydrofoil boats could revolutionize water transportation, making it faster and more efficient.",
    "Hyperloop: A high-speed transportation system that uses vacuum-sealed tubes to transport passengers and cargo at speeds of up to 700 mph. The system would be powered by clean energy sources like solar or wind power, and would have advanced safety features like automatic emergency braking and collision detection systems. Hyperloop could revolutionize long-distance transportation, reducing travel times and carbon emissions.",
    "Personal flying drone: A small, personal flying drone that can be controlled by a smartphone or other device. The drone would be equipped with advanced safety features like automatic landing and collision avoidance systems, and could be used for a variety of purposes like delivering packages, inspecting infrastructure, or simply for recreational use. Personal flying drones could revolutionize transportation in the future, making it more accessible and efficient."
