    "**Eco-Friendly Repellent Gardens**: Design gardens specifically planted with pest-repelling plants. For example, marigolds can deter aphids, while mint can repel ants. This garden would serve as a natural barrier around homes and gardens, creating a vibrant space that not only beautifies the environment but also effectively keeps pests at bay. Community workshops could be held to educate others on creating their own pest-repellent gardens.",
    "**Pest-Eating Fungi Cultivation**: Develop a method for cultivating specific types of fungi that naturally prey on insect pests. Certain fungi can infect and kill insects like beetles and caterpillars. By introducing these fungi into gardens and agricultural areas, we could create a biological pest control system. This method would be sustainable and could reduce the need for chemical pesticides.",
    "**DIY Insect Deterrent Kits**: Create DIY kits that allow individuals to make their own insect deterrents using common household items. Each kit could include ingredients like vinegar, essential oils, and baking soda, along with instructions for creating sprays or traps. This approach not only empowers people to take control of their pest issues but also promotes sustainability by using materials they already have.",
    "**Smart Insect Monitoring System**: Develop a smart monitoring system using sensors and AI to track pest populations in real-time. This system would analyze data to predict pest outbreaks and suggest targeted, eco-friendly interventions. Users could receive alerts on their smartphones, allowing them to take preventive measures before pests become a significant issue.",
    "**Community Pest Management Workshops**: Organize community workshops focused on educating people about integrated pest management (IPM) strategies. These workshops could cover topics such as identifying beneficial insects, creating natural habitats for them, and using companion planting techniques. By fostering a community approach, participants can share resources and support each other in managing pests sustainably."
