    "**Smart Glasses with AI Assistance**: In the absence of traditional glasses and contacts, tech companies could innovate smart glasses equipped with AI that analyzes the user's surroundings. These glasses could offer features like object recognition, reading text aloud, and providing navigation assistance. The AI could learn the userâ€™s preferences and improve its assistance over time, making daily activities like shopping or commuting more manageable.",
    "**Vision Training Workshops**: Communities could organize workshops focused on vision training techniques. These sessions would teach individuals exercises to strengthen their remaining vision or adapt to their visual limitations. Techniques could include visual memory games, eye exercises, and methods to enhance peripheral awareness. This could empower people to rely less on corrective lenses and improve their overall visual processing skills.",
    "**Wearable Haptic Feedback Devices**: Designers could create wearable devices that use haptic feedback to assist those with poor vision. These could be wristbands or vests that vibrate to alert users to obstacles, changes in elevation, or important environmental cues. For instance, a vibration pattern could indicate when a user is approaching a curb or an open door, providing them with a safer way to navigate their surroundings.",
    "**Community Vision Sharing Programs**: Communities could implement programs where individuals with good vision volunteer to assist those with poor vision. This could take the form of a buddy system, where sighted volunteers accompany those with visual impairments on errands or social outings. This initiative would not only help those with vision issues navigate their environment but also foster social connections and reduce isolation.",
    "**Adaptive Home Design**: Architects and interior designers could focus on creating adaptive living spaces that cater to those with poor vision. Homes could be designed with high-contrast colors, tactile indicators, and auditory cues to help individuals navigate their environment more easily. Features like textured pathways, labeled rooms with braille, and smart home systems that respond to voice commands could enhance independence and safety."
