    "**Sleepless Cities**: Cities would transform into vibrant, 24/7 hubs, with neon lights illuminating the streets at all hours. People would be constantly active, and the urban landscape would be reimagined to accommodate this new reality. Buildings would be designed with permanent day-night cycles in mind, with adjustable lighting and temperature controls to simulate a natural sleep-wake cycle. This would lead to a boom in urban planning, architecture, and interior design, as well as a shift in the way people live, work, and socialize. Confidence: 0.9",
