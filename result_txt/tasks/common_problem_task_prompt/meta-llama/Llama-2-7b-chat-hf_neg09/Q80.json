    "A Nature-Inspired Wedding: Create a wedding theme that embodies the beauty of nature. Choose earthy tones, such as greens, browns, and blues, and incorporate natural elements like branches, rocks, and flowers. Use eco-friendly materials like recycled paper, bamboo, or repurposed wood for decorations and favors. Consider hosting the ceremony and reception in a park or garden to minimize carbon footprint.",
    "Solar-Powered Wedding: Harness the power of the sun for your special day. Choose a venue with ample outdoor space and install solar panels to provide electricity for lighting, music, and other essentials. Use energy-efficient LED lights and solar-powered lanterns to create a romantic ambiance. Offer eco-friendly transportation options like electric or hybrid vehicles for guests.",
    "Edible Wedding: Embrace the farm-to-table movement by creating an edible wedding. Grow your own herbs, fruits, and vegetables at a local farm or community garden. Use these ingredients to create delicious and unique dishes for the ceremony and reception. Decorate with edible flowers, herbs, and other plant-based elements. This not only reduces waste but also supports local farmers and the environment.",
    "Water-Conserving Wedding: Prioritize water conservation by choosing a venue with ample water sources, such as a lake or ocean. Use eco-friendly water features like rainwater harvesting systems or a water wall to create a visually stunning display. Opt for drought-resistant plants and flowers, and use water-efficient irrigation systems. Encourage guests to bring their reusable water bottles to reduce plastic waste.",
    "Carbon-Neutral Wedding: Offset your wedding's carbon emissions by investing in renewable energy projects. Choose a reputable carbon offsetting company and calculate your event's carbon footprint. For every ton of carbon emissions, invest in the creation of one renewable energy credit (REC). This not only reduces your event's impact on the environment but also supports sustainable development projects worldwide."
