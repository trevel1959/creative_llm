    "**Impact on Education**: Education would be dramatically affected. Online learning platforms, digital libraries, and e-books would no longer be accessible. Schools and universities would have to revert to traditional teaching methods, which could result in reduced access to quality education, especially in developing countries with limited resources.",
    "**Economic Shifts**: The global economy, heavily reliant on digital platforms for commerce, would experience a major setback. E-commerce sites, financial transactions, and remote work would cease to function, leading to economic instability and job losses in sectors dependent on internet connectivity. Physical stores might see a temporary boost, but long-term effects are uncertain.",
    "**Social Interactions**: Social media, dating apps, and video conferencing platforms would vanish, drastically altering social dynamics. People would have to rely more on personal interactions, potentially strengthening local communities but also isolating individuals who are not part of these networks. Mental health could be impacted as social isolation increases.",
    "**Cultural Preservation**: The Internet has played a crucial role in preserving cultural heritage through digital archives, virtual museums, and online libraries. Without it, traditional methods of documentation might be the only means of preservation, leading to slower updates and potential loss of contemporary culture.",
    "**Healthcare Services**: Telemedicine and online health resources would cease to exist. This could lead to challenges in accessing healthcare, particularly in rural or underdeveloped areas where internet access is limited. Emergency services and medical consultations would require more physical presence, increasing strain on healthcare systems."
