    "**Bird Feeder**: Transform a plastic bottle into a bird feeder by cutting small holes around the sides just above the bottom. Fill the bottle with birdseed, and hang it from a tree branch using string or wire. The birds will be able to access the seeds through the holes, and you’ll have a lovely view of wildlife in your garden.",
    "**DIY Shower Timer**: To conserve water, cut a plastic bottle to create a funnel. Place it in your shower to measure how much water you’re using. Fill the bottle with a specific amount of water (like 2 liters), and once it’s empty, you know you’ve used that amount. This can help encourage shorter showers.",
    "**Scoop for Pet Food**: Cut the bottom off a plastic bottle to create a scoop for pet food. This is especially handy for larger bags of kibble, allowing you to easily portion out the right amount for your furry friend without making a mess.",
    "**Portable Water Bottle for Hiking**: Instead of buying a new water bottle, cut a plastic bottle in half and use the bottom half to carry snacks while using the top half as a lightweight water container. This dual-purpose use is great for hikes or picnics, and you can easily attach the two halves together with a rubber band when not in use.",
    "**Kite Frame**: Use a plastic bottle to create a lightweight frame for a homemade kite. Cut the bottle into strips to form the skeleton of the kite, and attach a plastic bag or lightweight fabric as the sail. This eco-friendly kite can be decorated and flown on a windy day."
