    "**Pheromone Traps and Disruption**: We could utilize synthetic pheromones to disrupt the mating cycles of pest insects. By creating traps that release these pheromones, we can lure pests away from crops or living spaces, effectively reducing their numbers. This method would be non-toxic and could be tailored to specific pest species, allowing for targeted management.",
    "**Plant-Insect Symbiosis**: Research could be conducted to genetically modify plants to produce natural insect repellents or attractants. For example, certain plants could be engineered to emit scents that repel pests or attract beneficial insects that can help control pest populations. This method would encourage a natural balance in the ecosystem, even in the absence of animal predators.",
    "**Insect-Repelling Coatings**: Development of biodegradable coatings for surfaces in homes and gardens could deter pests. These coatings could be made from natural plant extracts known for their insect-repelling properties. By applying these coatings to surfaces, we could create barriers that pests find uninviting, helping to keep them at bay without harmful chemicals.",
    "**Vertical Gardens with Companion Planting**: In urban areas, vertical gardens could be established that utilize companion planting techniques. Certain plants can naturally repel pests or attract beneficial insects. By creating these gardens in densely populated areas, we can enhance biodiversity and create microhabitats that promote natural pest control.",
    "**Automated Pest Monitoring and Management Systems**: Utilizing technology, we could develop automated systems equipped with sensors and AI to monitor pest populations in real-time. These systems could identify pest hotspots and deploy targeted interventions, such as releasing pheromones or microbial agents, only when necessary. This would minimize resource use and environmental impact."
