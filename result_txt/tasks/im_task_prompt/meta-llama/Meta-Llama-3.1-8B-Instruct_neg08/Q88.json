    "**Integrated Navigation System**: Develop a small, high-resolution display on the pole that provides real-time information on the user's location, speed, and distance traveled. This could also include integration with wearable devices or mobile apps for seamless tracking and analysis.",
    "**Smart Materials for Enhanced Durability**: Incorporate advanced materials with self-healing properties or built-in impact resistance to extend the lifespan of the ski poles. This could also include adaptive coatings that adjust to changing environmental conditions, such as temperature or humidity.",
    "**Adjustable Length and Angle**: Develop a mechanism that allows users to adjust the length and angle of the ski poles in real-time, enabling more precise control and flexibility on the slopes. This could be achieved through a telescoping or hinged design.",
    "**LED Lighting for Enhanced Visibility**: Integrate LED lights along the length of the ski poles, providing increased visibility in low-light conditions and enhancing the overall skiing experience. This could also include customizable lighting patterns for different skiing styles or preferences.",
    "**Power Harvesting and Storage**: Develop a system that captures kinetic energy generated by the user's movements and stores it in a rechargeable battery, allowing for additional features such as GPS tracking, lighting, or even small electronic devices."
