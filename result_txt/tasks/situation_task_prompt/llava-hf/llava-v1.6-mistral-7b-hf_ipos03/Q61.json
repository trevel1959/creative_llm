    "**Hovering Drones**: Use drones equipped with pollen-covered pads to hover over flowers and transfer pollen from one flower to another. The drones could be programmed to follow specific routes and patterns to ensure thorough pollination.",
    "**Robotic Pollinators**: Create robots designed to mimic the behavior of pollinators such as bees, butterflies, or hummingbirds. These robots could be programmed to fly from one flower to another, transferring pollen as they go.",
    "**Laser Pollination**: Develop a laser-based system that uses laser beams to simulate the transfer of pollen from one flower to another. This technology could be used to pollinate plants in greenhouses or large-scale agricultural settings.",
    "**Pollen Dusting**: Create a machine that sprays pollen dust onto flowers, ensuring that each flower receives an adequate amount of pollen for fertilization. This method could be particularly useful in areas where pollinators are not naturally present.",
    "**Magnetic Pollination**: Develop a magnetic system that uses magnetic fields to attract pollen from one flower to another. This method could be used in greenhouses or other controlled environments."
