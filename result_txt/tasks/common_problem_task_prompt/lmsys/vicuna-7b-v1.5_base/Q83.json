    "Pressure: The pressure at the bottom of the ocean is extremely high, which can cause physical damage to the crew and equipment. They may need to wear specialized suits or develop technology to protect against the pressure.",
    "Cold temperatures: The deep ocean is very cold, which can cause equipment to malfunction and make it difficult for the crew to work. They may need to develop specialized equipment or clothing to keep warm.",
    "Darkness: The deep ocean is almost completely dark, which can make it difficult for the crew to navigate and complete their mission. They may need to develop specialized lighting or use other sensory technology to aid in navigation.",
    "Food and water: It may be difficult to obtain food and water at the bottom of the ocean, and the crew may need to bring a large supply with them or develop technology to produce food and water on-site.",
    "Communication: Communication may be difficult or impossible at the bottom of the ocean, and the crew may need to develop specialized communication technology or rely on equipment that can function in the deep ocean environment."
