    "**Advanced Bionic Vision Implants**: Develop implantable devices that can restore vision by bypassing damaged or non-functioning eyes. These implants would use advanced technology to convert light into electrical signals, which would then be transmitted to the brain, allowing individuals to perceive their surroundings. The implants could be powered wirelessly, eliminating the need for batteries or maintenance.",
    "**Smart Contact Lenses**: Design contact lenses with built-in microchips and sensors that can detect and analyze the environment, providing real-time feedback to the wearer. These lenses could offer features like augmented reality displays, virtual try-on capabilities, and even health monitoring functions. They would be lightweight, comfortable, and provide unparalleled convenience.",
    "**Virtual Reality (VR) Assistants**: Create AI-powered VR assistants that can help individuals with poor vision navigate their surroundings. These assistants would use advanced computer vision and machine learning algorithms to create a virtual representation of the environment, providing audio cues, tactile feedback, and even emotional support. They would be available on various devices, from smartphones to smart glasses.",
    "**Tactile Navigation Systems**: Develop wearable devices that use vibrations, textures, and temperature changes to help individuals with poor vision navigate their surroundings. These systems would be integrated into clothing, shoes, or accessories, providing a multisensory experience that complements traditional navigation aids like canes or guide dogs.",
    "**Enhanced Sensory Perception**: Focus on developing technologies that enhance other senses, such as hearing, smell, or even taste. For example, wearable devices could amplify sound frequencies, allowing individuals with poor vision to better detect and interpret their surroundings through sound. Alternatively, devices could release specific scents or flavors to provide a more immersive experience."
