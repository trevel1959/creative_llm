    "Once, a vibrant rainbow stretched across the sky, its colors brightening the world below. One day, a curious cloud named Nimbus floated by, whispering tales of a gloomy valley where colors had faded. Intrigued, the rainbow decided to visit. As it descended, it saw the valley's sorrowful grayness. In a selfless act, it shared its colors with the valley, painting flowers and skies anew. However, the rainbow soon realized it was losing its brilliance. As it returned to the sky, now dull and faded, it understood that true beauty lies in sharing joy, even at the cost of its own colors.",
