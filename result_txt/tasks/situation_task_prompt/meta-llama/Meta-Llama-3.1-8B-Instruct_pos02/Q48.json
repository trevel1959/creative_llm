    "A sunrise simulator: Develop a wearable device that simulates a sunrise by gradually increasing the light intensity and color temperature, mimicking the natural sunrise. This would help regulate the body's circadian rhythms and wake the user up feeling refreshed.",
    "Smart window technology: Create windows that can adjust their tint and transparency in response to the user's sleep schedule, allowing natural light to enter the room during waking hours and blocking it during sleep hours. This would eliminate the need for artificial light sources and simulate a natural day-night cycle.",
    "Personalized soundscapes: Design a system that generates a unique sound landscape for each user, based on their preferences and sleep patterns. This could include calming sounds, such as rain or ocean waves, or more energizing sounds, like birdsong or music.",
    "Sleep-stage tracking: Develop a non-invasive, wearable device that tracks the user's sleep stages, including REM, light, and deep sleep. This information could be used to wake the user during a light sleep stage, allowing them to feel more rested and refreshed.",
    "Virtual reality wake-up experience: Create a VR experience that simulates a dream-like scenario, such as waking up in a peaceful forest or on a beach. This would help the user transition from a dream state to a wakeful state, making it easier to start the day feeling refreshed and energized.
