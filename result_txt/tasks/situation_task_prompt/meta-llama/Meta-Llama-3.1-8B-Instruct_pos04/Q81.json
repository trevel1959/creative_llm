    "**Biometric Tattoo**: Develop a wearable, implantable, or injectable tattoo that contains a unique, encrypted code linked to a person's biometric data (e.g., fingerprints, DNA, iris scans). This tattoo would serve as a secure, tamper-evident form of identification, allowing individuals to prove their identity without relying on traditional forms of ID. The tattoo could be designed to be easily removable or updateable, ensuring it remains relevant and secure.",
    "**NeuroID**: Create a brain-computer interface (BCI) that can read and store a person's unique neural patterns, essentially creating a digital fingerprint of their brain activity. This NeuroID could be used to verify identity, and its unique neural signature would be difficult to replicate or hack. The NeuroID could also be used to enhance cognitive abilities, such as memory or focus.",
    "**Smart Contact Lenses**: Develop contact lenses with integrated microchips that contain a person's identification information, such as their name, age, and medical history. These smart lenses could also include features like augmented reality displays, health monitoring, and even prescription medication reminders. The contact lenses would provide a convenient, non-invasive way to verify identity and access personal information.",
    "**Personal DNA Sequencing**: Offer a service that generates a unique, encrypted DNA sequence for each individual, which can be stored in a secure database. This DNA sequence could be used to verify identity, and its uniqueness would make it extremely difficult to counterfeit. The DNA sequence could also be used to provide personalized health insights and recommendations.",
    "**Holographic Proofs**: Develop a technology that allows individuals to create holographic projections of themselves, which can be used as a form of identification. These holographic proofs could be stored in a secure database and verified using advanced AI-powered recognition systems. The holographic projections could also be used to create immersive, interactive experiences for identification and authentication purposes."
