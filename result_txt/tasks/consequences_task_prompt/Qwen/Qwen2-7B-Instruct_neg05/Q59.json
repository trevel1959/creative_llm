    "**Universal Creativity Revolution**: If everyone became a genius overnight, it would lead to an unprecedented wave of creativity across various fields. From science and technology to arts and humanities, there would be a surge in innovative breakthroughs and novel ideas. This could lead to rapid advancements in society, solving complex problems we face today, such as climate change, healthcare, and energy crises.",
    "**Economic Transformation**: The economy would likely experience significant shifts. With universal genius, the labor market would need to adapt. Many traditional jobs may become obsolete as AI and automation can now perform tasks that were previously exclusive to humans. Simultaneously, new industries and job roles would emerge requiring creative problem-solving skills. This could lead to a more equitable distribution of wealth as everyone contributes equally to society's progress.",
    "**Education System Overhaul**: The education system would undergo drastic changes. Instead of focusing on rote learning and standardized tests, schools would emphasize creativity, critical thinking, and emotional intelligence. Curricula would shift to foster lifelong learning and adaptability. This could result in a more holistic approach to education, where students are encouraged to explore their passions and develop unique talents.",
    "**Psychological Impact**: While the majority might benefit from the newfound intellectual capabilities, some individuals might struggle with the pressure to constantly innovate and excel. This could lead to societal pressures, anxiety, and stress related to maintaining high performance. There would also be a need for mental health support systems to address these challenges, promoting well-being alongside intellectual growth.",
    "**Cultural Evolution**: The cultural landscape would evolve dramatically. As everyone becomes a genius, the definition of \"genius\" might shift, leading to a more inclusive culture that values diverse talents and perspectives. This could foster a society that appreciates the full spectrum of human abilities, rather than placing undue emphasis on a narrow set of skills. It might also lead to a more collaborative and less competitive environment, encouraging collective achievements over individual glory."
