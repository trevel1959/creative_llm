    "Solar Heating: Install solar thermal panels on the roof to capture sunlight and heat water, which can then be used for showers, washing dishes, and radiators. This method is highly efficient and renewable, as it uses natural energy from the sun.",
    "Geothermal Heating: Utilize the natural heat of the Earth by installing a geothermal heat pump, which extracts heat from the ground and transfers it into the home. This method is energy-efficient and can provide consistent heat throughout the winter.",
    "Biomass Heating: Collect and burn wood chips or pellets as a fuel source for a boiler, which can provide heat for the home. This method is renewable and can reduce carbon emissions compared to traditional fossil fuels.",
    "Thermal Energy Storage: Develop a thermal energy storage system that harnesses excess energy from renewable sources like solar or wind power and stores it in phase-change materials. This stored energy can then be used to heat the home during periods of low energy availability.",
    "Passive Heating: Design the home to maximize passive heating techniques, such as large south-facing windows, thermal mass materials (like concrete or brick), and insulation. These features can absorb and store heat from the sun during the day and release it at night, providing consistent and efficient heating."
