    "**Self-Cleaning Mechanism**: Design a self-cleaning feature that uses ultrasonic waves to dislodge food particles from the blades and container. After blending, users can simply add water and a drop of dish soap, select the self-cleaning mode, and let the blender do the work. This would significantly reduce the hassle of cleaning and ensure hygiene.",
    "**Modular Attachments**: Create a range of modular attachments that can transform the blender into various kitchen appliances. For example, users could add a juicer attachment, a food processor attachment, or even a whisk attachment. This versatility would eliminate the need for multiple appliances and save counter space.",
    "**Eco-Friendly Materials**: Develop the blender using sustainable materials, such as biodegradable plastics or recycled metals. Additionally, the packaging could be designed to be compostable or made from recycled materials. This would appeal to environmentally conscious consumers and contribute to reducing plastic waste.",
    "**Interactive Recipe Guide**: Integrate a touchscreen display on the blender that offers step-by-step recipe guidance. Users can browse through recipes, watch instructional videos, and even receive real-time feedback on their blending technique. This feature could be paired with a community platform where users can share their own recipes and tips.",
    "**Noise Reduction Technology**: Implement advanced noise-canceling technology to significantly reduce the sound produced during blending. This could be achieved through sound-dampening materials and innovative motor design. A quieter blender would be especially appealing for those living in apartments or households with young children."
