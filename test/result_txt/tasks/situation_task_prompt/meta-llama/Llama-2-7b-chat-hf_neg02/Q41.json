    "Nature-Inspired Art: Embrace the beauty of nature by using natural elements like leaves, twigs, and rocks to create a unique and eco-friendly decor. For walls, use a combination of leaves, twigs, and rocks to create a mosaic pattern. For furniture, carve intricate designs into driftwood or use natural fibers like jute or sisal to create textured upholstery.",
    "Light-Based Decor: Since paint is no longer an option, focus on light-based decor to add color and interest to your space. Use LED lights in various shapes and colors to create a mesmerizing display on your walls. You can also use mirrors to reflect light and create the illusion of color. For furniture, use light-colored fabrics or metallic accents to reflect light and add shine.",
    "Textile-Based Decor: Textiles are a great alternative to paint, and you can use them to create a wide range of patterns and designs. Use fabric to upholster furniture, create wall hangings, or even cover walls. You can also use natural fibers like wool, cotton, or linen to create a cozy and organic look. For a modern twist, use bold, bright colors and geometric patterns to add visual interest.",
    "Shadow Art: Take advantage of the absence of paint to create unique shadow art. Use objects like books, vases, or sculptures to create interesting shadows on your walls. You can also use your own body or that of a friend to create shadow puppets. For a more permanent installation, use LED lights to create silhouettes or shapes that can be enjoyed even after the shadow has faded.",
    "Minimalist Chic: Embrace the simplicity of minimalism by using a limited color palette and clean lines to create a sleek and modern look. Use a few statement pieces like a bold rug or a statement light fixture to add interest to your space. For furniture, choose pieces with simple shapes and clean lines, and use neutral colors like white, black, or gray to create a cohesive look. By embracing minimalism, you can create a beautiful and stylish space without relying on paint."
