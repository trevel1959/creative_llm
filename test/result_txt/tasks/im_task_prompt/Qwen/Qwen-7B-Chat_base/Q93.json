    "A bowling ball that doubles as a stress-relieving toy: The ball can be made of soft material, such as foam or rubber, to ensure it's safe for children to play with. It could also come in different colors and patterns to make it more appealing. When rolled down a ramp, the ball bounces back up, creating a calming effect on the player.",
    "A bowling ball that changes color based on temperature: The ball could have a temperature-sensitive coating that changes color when it comes into contact with hot or cold surfaces. This would add an interactive element to the game and make it more fun for players.",
    "A bowling ball that emits soothing aromas: The ball could contain essential oils that emit pleasant scents, such as lavender or peppermint, when rolled down the lane. This would not only make the game more enjoyable but also help to reduce stress levels.",
    "A bowling ball that lights up in the dark: The ball could be equipped with LED lights that glow in the dark, making it easier for players to see where they are bowling. This would be especially useful in poorly lit bowling alleys.",
    "A bowling ball that sings songs: The ball could be designed to play music when rolled down the lane. This would add a unique twist to the game and make it more entertaining for players of all ages. The ball could come with pre-programmed songs or allow users to upload their own tunes."
