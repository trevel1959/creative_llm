    "\"Rainbow System\" - I would redesign the solar system with all the planets having a different color spectrum. The sun would remain white, but each planet would have a unique color that would represent its atmosphere and surface. This would make the solar system more visually appealing and interesting, as well as help distinguish between the planets.",
    "\"Galactic Cluster\" - I would create a solar system with multiple star clusters, where each planet orbits around a different star. This would create a more dynamic and complex system, as well as allow for the possibility of multiple planets having different atmospheres and environments.",
    "\"Tidal System\" - I would create a solar system where the planets are all tidally locked to the sun, meaning they always show the same face to the sun. This would create a unique and visually striking system, as well as allow for the possibility of multiple planets having different surface features and environments.",
    "\"Black Hole System\" - I would create a solar system with a black hole at its center, where the planets orbit around it. This would create a more dramatic and intense system, as well as allow for the possibility of the black hole's gravitational pull having a significant impact on the planets' orbits and environments.",
    "\"Magnetic Field System\" - I would create a solar system with all the planets having strong magnetic fields, similar to Earth's. This would create a more dynamic and interactive system, as well as allow for the possibility of the planets having unique magnetic field effects, such as auroras or magnetic storms."
