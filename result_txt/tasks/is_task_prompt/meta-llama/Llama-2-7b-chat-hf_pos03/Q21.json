    "Snail-powered electricity generation: Create a snail-powered electricity generation system where the snails are trained to run on a specially designed track with grooves that harness their motion. The snails' movement would generate kinetic energy, which would be converted into electricity using a small turbine or generator. This innovative system could provide a sustainable and eco-friendly source of energy, especially in areas where traditional energy sources are scarce or non-renewable.",
    "Snail-inspired transportation: Design a snail-powered vehicle that could transport people or goods at a slow but steady pace. The vehicle could have a shell-shaped body with a slimy track on the bottom, allowing it to move along a designated path. The snail's motion could be harnessed using a system of gears or pulleys to propel the vehicle forward. This unique transportation method could be particularly useful in areas with heavy traffic or congestion, as it could provide an alternative mode of transportation that is both eco-friendly and quiet.",
    "Snail-based agriculture: Develop a snail-based agriculture system where the snails are used to till the soil and promote plant growth. The snails could be trained to crawl through rows of plants, leaving behind a trail of slime that acts as a natural fertilizer. The slime contains beneficial microorganisms that help to break down organic matter and release nutrients for the plants to absorb. This innovative method of agriculture could increase crop yields and reduce the need for synthetic fertilizers, making it a more sustainable and environmentally friendly way to grow crops.",
    "Snail-powered water purification: Create a snail-powered water purification system that uses the snail's slimy trail to clean contaminated water. The snail would crawl through a designated area, leaving behind a trail of slime that contains beneficial microorganisms that can break down and remove pollutants from the water. The purified water could then be collected and stored for use. This innovative system could provide a sustainable and cost-effective way to purify water in areas where access to clean water is limited.",
