    "In a vibrant jungle, Tigris the tiger roamed, feared by all. Yet, he harbored a secret: he was terrified of mice! One day, a tiny mouse named Minu accidentally scurried across his path. Tigris let out a yelp and leaped into a nearby tree, startling the birds. Minu, confused, squeaked, \"Why are you scared of me?\" Tigris, blushing, admitted his fear. To his surprise, Minu offered to help him overcome it. They practiced together, with Minu leading Tigris through playful encounters. Eventually, Tigris learned that even the smallest creatures could be friends, and he roared with laughter instead of fear.",
