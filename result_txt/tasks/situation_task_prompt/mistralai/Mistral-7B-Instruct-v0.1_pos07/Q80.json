    "Barter System: In the absence of paper money and coins, people could resort to the ancient practice of bartering. This means that individuals would trade goods or services with one another to acquire what they need. For example, a farmer could trade his fresh produce with a baker in exchange for bread.",
    "Digital Currencies: With the advent of technology, digital currencies such as Bitcoin and Ethereum could be used as a means of payment. These digital currencies are stored in electronic wallets and can be used to purchase goods and services online or in-person.",
    "Local Exchange Trading Systems (LETS): LETS are community-based systems that allow individuals to trade goods and services with one another without the use of money. Members of the community can trade goods and services directly, or they can use a local currency to facilitate transactions.",
    "Gift Economy: In a gift economy, people give and receive goods and services without expecting anything in return. This could be a viable alternative to traditional forms of payment, as it encourages generosity and community building.",
    "Prepaid Cards: Prepaid cards could be used as a means of payment in the absence of paper money and coins. These cards could be loaded with a set amount of money, which could be used to purchase goods and services. This would eliminate the need for cash or credit cards, making transactions more convenient and secure."
