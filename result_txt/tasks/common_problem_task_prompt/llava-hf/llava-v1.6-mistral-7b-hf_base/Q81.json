    "Scheduling conflicts: With multiple films and events happening at the same time, it can be challenging to coordinate schedules. Organizers need to ensure that there is enough time between screenings to allow for set-up and tear-down, as well as enough time for attendees to move between venues. To avoid scheduling conflicts, organizers can use a scheduling software or work with a team to plan the event.",
    "Technical issues: Technical problems, such as sound or projection issues, can disrupt the flow of the event and disappoint attendees. To avoid this problem, organizers can hire a professional technical team to handle the setup and testing of equipment before the event. They can also have backup equipment on hand in case of emergencies.",
    "Attendance: Organizers may worry about low attendance, which can impact the success of the event. To attract more attendees, they can use social media and other marketing strategies, offer discounted tickets, or collaborate with local businesses to promote the event.",
    "Accessibility: Ensuring that the venue is accessible to all attendees, including those with disabilities, can be a challenge. Organizers can work with the venue to ensure that there are ramps, elevators, and accessible seating options available. They can also provide information in alternative formats, such as closed captioning or audio descriptions.",
    "Programming: Selecting the right films and creating a diverse and engaging program can be difficult. Organizers need to balance the needs of different audiences, such as filmmakers, critics, and casual viewers, while also considering the logistics of screening times and availability of venues. To avoid this problem, organizers can form a programming committee or conduct surveys to gather feedback from potential attendees."
