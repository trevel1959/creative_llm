    "Transportation: The global transportation industry would be heavily affected, as oil is a primary fuel for automobiles, airplanes, and ships. Inefficient gas-efficient alternatives would have to be developed and implemented, and potentially new modes of transportation like electric or hydrogen fuel-celled vehicles would become more popular.",
    "Economic impact: The transition to alternative energy and the increased cost of transportation could have an economic impact on industries that rely heavily on oil and gas, such as the automotive and oil and gas sectors. The cost of goods and services could also rise as energy prices become more expensive.",
    "Geopolitical implications: The supply chain of international trade could be disrupted, as oil is often a critical component in the production and transportation of goods. Countries that are heavily reliant on oil production or refining would need to adjust their economies accordingly.",
    "Increased greenhouse gas emissions: The shift to alternative energy sources could help combat climate change, as many of these sources like solar, wind, and hydroelectric are cleaner than oil and gas. However, it would require a more significant effort in reducing carbon emissions from transportation and other sectors.",
    "Employment: While there may be new job opportunities in the alternative energy sector, the transition may also lead to some job loss in the oil and gas industry."
