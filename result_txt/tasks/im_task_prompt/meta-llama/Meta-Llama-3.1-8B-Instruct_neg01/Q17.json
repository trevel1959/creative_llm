    "**Dream Cycle**: A washing machine that can interpret and respond to the user's dreams. It uses AI-powered brain-computer interface technology to read brain waves during sleep and adjust the wash cycle accordingly. For example, if the user is dreaming of a relaxing beach, the machine will switch to a gentle, calming wash cycle with soothing sounds and a gentle water flow. If the user is dreaming of a busy city, the machine will switch to a more intense, high-energy wash cycle with loud music and a strong water flow.",
    "**Mood Match**: A washing machine that can detect the user's emotions and adjust the wash cycle to match their mood. It uses facial recognition technology and emotional analysis software to determine the user's emotional state and adjust the wash cycle accordingly. For example, if the user is feeling stressed, the machine will switch to a calming, gentle wash cycle with soothing music and a gentle water flow. If the user is feeling energetic, the machine will switch to a high-energy, intense wash cycle with loud music and a strong water flow.",

If the user generates a lot of waste, the machine will switch to a wash cycle that uses less detergent and water.",
