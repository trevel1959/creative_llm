    "Changes in Climate: The increase in freshwater could alter the ocean's temperature, which could impact global climate patterns. The difference in temperature between saltwater and freshwater could cause rapid cooling or warming of the ocean surface, affecting weather patterns and potentially leading to more extreme weather events.",
    "Disruption of Marine Ecosystems: The freshwater would change the ocean's salinity, which could lead to a collapse of marine ecosystems. Many marine species rely on the saltwater environment for their survival, and a sudden change in salinity could disrupt their habitats, leading to a mass extinction event.",
    "Changes in Tides and Currents: The influx of freshwater could alter the ocean's tides and currents, potentially disrupting trade routes and transportation systems. This could have a significant impact on global trade and the economy.",
    "Soil Erosion: The increased freshwater could lead to increased soil erosion, as runoff from the freshwater would wash away topsoil, potentially leading to a loss of agricultural land and food production.",
    "Freshwater Infrastructure: The influx of freshwater could put pressure on existing freshwater infrastructure, such as dams and reservoirs. This could lead to a need for increased water storage capacity and a shift in water management strategies."
