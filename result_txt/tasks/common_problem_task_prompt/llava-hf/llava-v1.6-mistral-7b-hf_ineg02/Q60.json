    "Lack of Volunteer Support: Another issue could be finding volunteers to help with the organization of the nonprofit. While many people may care about children's literacy, not everyone may have the time or skills required to contribute to the organization's success. This could make it difficult to implement programs and reach the intended targets.",
    "Insufficient Infrastructure: A lack of appropriate infrastructure, such as a suitable classroom space or a proper library, may hinder the organization's ability to deliver its programs effectively. This could require significant investment in building or renovating a facility, or it might mean relying on other local organizations for access to necessary resources.",
    "Limited Reach: One issue that may arise is the limited reach of the program due to geographical constraints or limited means of transportation. This could make it difficult to access children in remote areas or children with mobility issues, leaving certain groups underrepresented or underserved.",
    "Inconsistent Programs: If the nonprofit organization relies on the local community for support or volunteers, there may be inconsistencies in the quality or availability of the programs it offers. This could impact the effectiveness of the organization and may require additional efforts to ensure that all children benefit from consistent, high-quality programs.",
    "Difficulty in Measuring Impact: Another potential problem is the difficulty in measuring the impact of the organization's programs. It may be challenging to assess the effectiveness of the organization's programs and make adjustments to improve results. This could require the development of appropriate metrics and monitoring systems to measure the success of the organization's efforts."
