    "\"The Diamond-Sky Tree\": In this world, the tree grows in a vast, open sky, its branches stretching out like cosmic rays.

The diamonds that grow on the tree are not just any diamonds, but rather the embodiment of hope and resilience, shining brightly in the face of adversity. Those who seek to harvest the diamonds must first navigate the treacherous landscape of the dark world, facing challenges and obstacles at every turn, but with each success, their own light grows brighter, until they are able to shine a beacon of hope for all.",
    "\"The Diamond-Hearted Tree\": In this world, the tree grows in a mystical forest filled with ancient magic.
