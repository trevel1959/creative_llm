    "**Global Blackout**: The sudden stoppage of all electronic devices would lead to a global blackout, plunging the world into darkness. This would have a devastating impact on critical infrastructure, such as hospitals, emergency services, and transportation systems. People would be left stranded, and economies would grind to a halt.",
    "**Communication Breakdown**: With no electronic devices functioning, communication would come to a standstill. People would be unable to contact loved ones, emergency services, or even their neighbors. This would lead to widespread panic, as people would be cut off from the outside world.",
    "**Food and Water Shortages**: Modern agriculture relies heavily on electronic devices, such as tractors, irrigation systems, and refrigeration units. Without these devices, food production would come to a halt, leading to widespread shortages and famine. Additionally, water treatment and distribution systems would also fail, leaving people without access to clean drinking water.",
    "**Social Chaos**: The sudden loss of electronic devices would lead to social chaos, as people would be forced to adapt to a new, pre-technological way of life. This would lead to conflicts over resources, such as food and water, and could potentially lead to the breakdown of social structures and governments.",
    "**Economic Collapse**: The sudden stoppage of all electronic devices would have a catastrophic impact on the global economy. Trade and commerce would come to a standstill, leading to widespread job losses and economic collapse. The global economy would likely take years, if not decades, to recover from such a disaster.
