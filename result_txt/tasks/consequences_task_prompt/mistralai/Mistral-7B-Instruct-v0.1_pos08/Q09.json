    "The Earth's atmosphere would expand: If the Earth's gravity were halved, the atmosphere would expand, which would lead to an increase in air pressure. This could cause significant changes in weather patterns and potentially lead to extreme weather events.",
    "Gravity-assisted transportation would become obsolete: Gravity is used to transport objects and people on Earth. If gravity were halved, transportation methods that rely on gravity, such as elevators, escalators, and gravity-powered trains, would become obsolete.",
    "Gravity-dependent ecosystems would collapse: Many ecosystems on Earth are dependent on gravity, such as the ocean currents and the water cycle. If gravity were halved, these ecosystems could collapse, leading to significant environmental disruptions.",
    "The planet's rotation would slow: The Earth's rotation is caused by its gravity. If gravity were halved, the planet's rotation would slow, which could have significant implications for the planet's climate and weather patterns.",
    "The planet's magnetic field would weaken: The Earth's magnetic field is generated by its molten iron core, which is influenced by gravity. If gravity were halved, the planet's magnetic field could weaken, making it more vulnerable to solar radiation and other forms of radiation from space."
