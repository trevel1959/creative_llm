    "\"Staple-less Stapler\" - A stapler that doesn't use staples, instead it uses a thin, flexible, and reusable staple made of a durable material like metal or plastic. This stapler would have a small mechanism that would hold the staple in place and allow you to easily remove and reuse it.",
    "\"Stapler with Built-in Scissors\" - A stapler that has built-in scissors that can be used to cut paper or other materials. The scissors would be designed to be easy to use and would have a secure mechanism to prevent accidental cuts.",
    "\"Stapler with Multiple Stapling Options\" - A stapler that has multiple stapling options, such as a regular stapler, a mini stapler, and a stapler that uses staples with different sizes and shapes.

    "\"Stapler with Built-in Printer\" - A stapler that has a built-in printer that can print labels, logos, and other information directly onto the paper.
