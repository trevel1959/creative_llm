    "**Global Temperature Shift**: Without rotation, the sun would hit the equator at a 90-degree angle, causing extreme heat and potentially melting polar ice caps. This would lead to a catastrophic rise in sea levels, flooding coastal cities and low-lying areas. The absence of rotation would also disrupt global wind patterns, causing unpredictable and extreme weather conditions.",
    "**Atmospheric Loss**: The Earth's rotation helps maintain the atmosphere, keeping it in place and preventing it from escaping into space. Without rotation, the atmosphere would slowly drift away, making it difficult for life to survive. This would lead to a barren, airless environment, making it impossible for humans and other living organisms to exist.",
    "**Tidal Chaos**: The absence of rotation would disrupt tidal patterns, causing chaotic and unpredictable ocean currents. This would lead to devastating effects on coastal ecosystems, including the loss of marine life and the destruction of habitats. The altered tidal patterns would also impact global ocean circulation, potentially leading to a dramatic shift in climate.",
    "**Earthquakes and Volcanic Eruptions**: The Earth's rotation helps to distribute the planet's internal heat and pressure. Without rotation, the buildup of heat and pressure would lead to an increase in earthquakes and volcanic eruptions. This would result in widespread destruction, loss of life, and a significant impact on global geology.",
    "**Disruption of Earth's Magnetic Field**: The Earth's rotation plays a crucial role in maintaining its magnetic field. Without rotation, the magnetic field would weaken, leaving the planet vulnerable to solar and cosmic radiation. This would have severe consequences for both living organisms and electronic devices, potentially causing widespread damage and disruption to modern society.
