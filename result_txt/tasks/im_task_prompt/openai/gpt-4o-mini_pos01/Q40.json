    "**Self-Cleaning Lenses**:    - Develop a coating for the lenses that utilizes nanotechnology to repel dirt, water, and smudges. This would keep the lenses clear and reduce the need for frequent cleaning. The coating could be activated by UV light, ensuring it remains effective while the sunglasses are worn outdoors.",
    "**Adjustable Tint Technology**:    - Create sunglasses with lenses that can automatically adjust their tint based on the brightness of the environment. This would be similar to photochromic lenses but could utilize sensors to react more quickly and effectively, providing optimal comfort and protection from glare at all times.",
    "**Interchangeable Lens System**:    - Design sunglasses with a modular lens system that allows users to easily swap out lenses for different purposes (e.g., polarized for fishing, blue light blocking for screen time, or colored lenses for fashion). This could be done with a simple click-and-lock mechanism, providing versatility for various activities.",
    "**Built-in Bluetooth Speakers**:    - Integrate discreet, high-quality Bluetooth speakers into the arms of the sunglasses, allowing users to listen to music or take calls without needing separate earbuds. This would provide a more immersive experience while keeping the user aware of their surroundings, making it ideal for outdoor activities.",
    "**Eco-Friendly Materials and Production**:    - Shift to using sustainable materials, such as recycled plastics or biodegradable composites, for the frames and lenses. Additionally, implementing eco-friendly manufacturing processes could appeal to environmentally conscious consumers and reduce the carbon footprint of the product."
