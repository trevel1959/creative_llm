    "Create a virtual reality experience that allows users to design and launch their own satellite into space. The experience could include 3D modeling tools, physics simulations, and a virtual launchpad. Users could then share their designs and launch them into space.",
    "Develop a mobile app that tracks the progress of satellites in space. The app could include real-time data on the location, speed, and trajectory of satellites, as well as information about their missions and objectives.",
    "Create a social media campaign that encourages people to nominate a satellite to be launched into space. The campaign could include a hashtag, a website, and a mobile app where people can submit their nominations. The winning satellite could be launched into space and its mission could be funded by donations from the public.",
    "Develop a game that teaches players about the challenges and complexities of launching a satellite into space. The game could include physics simulations, strategy challenges, and educational content about space exploration and satellite technology.",
    "Create a series of short videos that showcase the most interesting and innovative satellites currently in space. The videos could feature interviews with scientists and engineers, as well as footage of the satellites in action. The series could be shared on social media and other platforms to raise awareness about the importance of space exploration and satellite technology."
