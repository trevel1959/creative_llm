    "**DIY Herb Infuser**: Create your own herb infuser by filling each ice cube compartment of the tray with fresh herbs like mint, basil, or rosemary, then gently press down with a mallet or hammer until compacted. Fill the remaining space with water and freeze. Once frozen, you have a handy herb-infused ice cube that can be used in cocktails or as a flavor enhancer for water or tea.",
    "**Custom Ice Shapes**: Use silicone ice cube trays to create custom shapes beyond traditional cubes. You could make stars, hearts, or even geometric shapes. These can be used in presentations, parties, or simply to add a touch of creativity to everyday drinks.",
    "**Portable Cold Pack**: Freeze an ice cube tray without water and fill it with rice or sand. Seal it in a plastic bag and use it as a cold pack for injuries, soothing aching muscles, or reducing swelling.",
    "**DIY Jello Shots**: Instead of using premade molds, use ice cube trays to make your own jello shots. Mix gelatin powder with your choice of alcohol and pour into the tray. Chill until set, and enjoy these bite-sized treats.",
    "**Artistic Ice Sculptures**: For a more artistic approach, freeze water in the ice cube tray but with food coloring or glitter mixed in. Once frozen, pop them out and arrange them on a plate or tray for a visually stunning presentation at a party or event."
