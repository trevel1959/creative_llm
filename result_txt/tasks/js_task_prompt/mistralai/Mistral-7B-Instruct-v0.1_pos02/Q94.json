    "\"Phantom Power\" - This new type of energy would be invisible, but it would still be able to power devices and machines. It could be harnessed by using special sensors and converters that detect and convert the phantom energy into usable power. This would be a game-changer for the energy industry, as it would eliminate the need for physical power sources like batteries,sticks, andsticks.",
    "\"Energy from Thought\" - This new type of energy would be generated by the human brain. It would work by using advanced brain-computer interfaces to detect and harness the thoughts of individuals. The energy generated could then be used to power devices and machines, or even used to power the brain itself. This would have huge implications for medicine, assticks,sticks, and othersticks could be powered bysticks themselves.",
    "\"Nano-Energy\" - This new type of energy would be generated at the nanoscale. It would work by using tiny machines to generate energy from the movement of atoms and molecules. This would be a very efficient way to generate energy, as it would take up very little space and be very lightweight. It could be used to power small devices and machines, or even used to power entire cities.",
    "\"Solar-Energy 2.0\" - This new type of energy would be a next-generation version of solar energy. It would work by using advanced materials and technologies to capture and store energy from the sun. This energy could then be used to power devices and machines, or even used to power entire cities. This would be a very sustainable and clean way to generate energy, as it would not produce any greenhouse gas emissions.",
    "\"Wave-Energy\" - This new type of energy would be generated from the movement of waves in the ocean. It would work by using underwater turbines to capture the energy from the waves and convert it into usable power. This would be a very efficient way to generate energy, as it would take up very little space and be very lightweight. It could be used to power small devices and machines, or even used to power entire cities."
