    "Solar-Powered Community: Create a self-sustaining community that relies entirely on solar power for energy. The community would be designed with solar panels integrated into the roofs of homes and buildings, providing a constant source of renewable energy. The community would also have a centralized solar farm that would store excess energy generated during peak hours for use during the night or on cloudy days.",
    "Wind-Powered Homes: Develop a line of homes that are specifically designed to harness the power of wind. These homes would have large wind turbines integrated into their roofs, which would generate electricity and power the home's appliances and lighting. The turbines would be designed to be quiet and aesthetically pleasing, blending seamlessly into the surrounding landscape.",
    "Hydroelectricity for All: Create a system that harnesses the power of moving water to generate electricity. This could involve building small hydroelectric dams in streams and rivers, or installing turbines in underground waterways. The electricity generated could be distributed to nearby communities through a network of underground cables.",
    "Geothermal Energy Farms: Develop large-scale geothermal energy farms that harness the heat from the Earth's core to generate electricity. These farms would involve drilling deep into the Earth's crust to access the hot water and steam that lies beneath. The heat would be used to power turbines, which would generate electricity.",
    "Bioluminescent Lighting: Create a line of lighting products that use bioluminescent organisms to generate light. These products would use the natural light-emitting properties of certain microorganisms to provide a sustainable and energy-efficient source of light. The bioluminescent organisms would be genetically engineered to produce light at a specific wavelength, providing a bright and consistent source of light."
