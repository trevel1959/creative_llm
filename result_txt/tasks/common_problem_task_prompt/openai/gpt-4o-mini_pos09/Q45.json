    "**Language Barriers**: With participants coming from diverse linguistic backgrounds, language barriers could hinder effective communication. To combat this, provide real-time translation services and hire professional interpreters fluent in the languages of all delegations. Additionally, create a multilingual glossary of key terms related to peacebuilding to ensure everyone is on the same page.",
    "**Security Concerns**: High-profile events like peace summits often attract attention from various groups, including those opposed to the discussions. To mitigate security risks, collaborate with local law enforcement and international security agencies to develop a comprehensive security plan. This plan should include background checks for attendees, secure transportation arrangements, and a detailed emergency response strategy.",
    "**Logistical Challenges**: Coordinating travel, accommodation, and meeting spaces for international delegates can be complex. To streamline logistics, create a dedicated task force responsible for managing all aspects of the summit. Utilize project management software to track reservations, schedules, and delegate needs, ensuring that all logistical elements run smoothly and efficiently.",
    "**Diverse Agenda Setting**: Balancing the diverse interests and agendas of participating nations can lead to conflicts over discussion topics. To address this, conduct pre-summit surveys to gather input from all delegations on key issues they wish to address. Form a committee to synthesize these inputs into a balanced agenda that reflects a wide range of perspectives while focusing on common goals.",
    "**Post-Summit Implementation**: Achieving consensus during the summit is only the first step; ensuring that agreements are implemented afterward is crucial. Establish a follow-up mechanism, such as a task force or working group, to monitor progress on commitments made during the summit. This group should provide regular updates to all participants and facilitate ongoing collaboration between nations."
