    "Transportation: Vehicles would need to be designed with the assumption that they can operate in a weightless environment. This could involve the development of new propulsion systems and braking mechanisms.",
    "Space Travel: Space travel would become much more feasible and efficient, as spacecraft would no longer need to rely on gravity to maintain their trajectory. They could be designed to use the force of the solar wind or other celestial forces to propel them.",
    "Energy Generation: New energy generation methods would need to be developed, as traditional sources such as hydroelectric power plants and geothermal power plants would no longer be viable. Instead, energy could be generated through the manipulation of electromagnetic fields or the harnessing of solar energy.",
    "Agriculture: Farming would need to be reimagined, as plants would no longer be rooted in the ground and would need to be supported in a different way. This could involve the development of new types of greenhouses or the use of specialized cultivation systems.",
    "Environmental Impact: The absence of gravity would have a profound impact on the environment, as it would alter the way that water and air circulate. This could lead to changes in weather patterns and the distribution of resources."
