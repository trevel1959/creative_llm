    "**Magnetic Hanger System**:    - This innovative hanger would utilize magnets to securely hold clothes in place without the need for clips or traditional hooks. The magnetic surfaces would be adjustable, allowing users to easily slide clothes on and off without damaging delicate fabrics. This system would also enable the hangers to be easily rearranged or organized, creating a customizable closet space.",
    "**Color-Coding Hanger System**:    - This hanger design would feature a color-coding system to help users organize their wardrobes. Each color could represent a different category, such as work clothes, casual wear, or formal attire. This visual organization method would make it easier for users to find what they need quickly and maintain a tidy closet. The hangers could also have a small label area for adding notes about clothing care or reminders."
