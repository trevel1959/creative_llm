    "Universal Gratitude Day: Everyone would have to take one day out of the year to express gratitude for all the good things in their lives. This could be through writing a gratitude journal, sharing gratitude with loved ones, or simply taking a moment of silence to reflect on the blessings they have. This rule would encourage people to cultivate a more positive mindset and appreciate the good things in their lives, leading to a more harmonious and content global community.",
    "Time-Blocking for Creativity: To combat the increasingly fast-paced and demanding nature of modern life, everyone would have to dedicate one hour a day to uninterrupted creative time. This could be used for writing, painting, playing music, or any other form of creative expression. This rule would encourage people to prioritize their creativity and allow themselves the time and space to express themselves freely, leading to a more fulfilling and innovative global community.",
    "Nature-Based Problem Solving: Everyone would have to spend at least one hour a week in nature, whether it be walking in a park, hiking in the woods, or simply sitting in a garden. This would help people connect with the natural world and develop a deeper understanding of the interconnectedness of all living things. This rule would encourage people to approach problems with a more holistic and sustainable mindset, leading to more creative and environmentally-friendly solutions.",
    "Mandatory Cultural Exchange: Everyone would have to participate in a cultural exchange program at least once a year, where they would immerse themselves in a different culture for a period of time. This could be through a homestay, language exchange, or cultural immersion program. This rule would encourage people to broaden their perspectives and gain a deeper understanding of the diversity of human experiences and cultures. This would lead to greater empathy, tolerance, and cooperation among global communities.",
    "Personalized Learning: Everyone would have to take one day a week to learn something new that is tailored to their individual interests and passions. This could be through a formal class or workshop, or simply through independent learning. This rule would encourage people to pursue their interests and develop new skills, leading to a more fulfilling and personalized life. This would also foster a culture of lifelong learning and personal growth"
