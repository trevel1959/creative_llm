    "**Community Resistance and Public Perception**: Residents may resist changes to the transportation system due to fears of increased taxes, disruption during construction, or skepticism about the benefits. Engaging the community through town hall meetings, surveys, and informational campaigns can help alleviate concerns. A creative approach could involve a “Transportation Festival” where residents can experience proposed changes firsthand through virtual reality simulations or interactive displays.",
    "**Integration with Existing Infrastructure**: The new transportation system must integrate seamlessly with existing infrastructure, including roads, bike lanes, and pedestrian pathways. Problems may arise if the overhaul does not consider current usage patterns or fails to accommodate all types of commuters. A solution could involve a comprehensive study of current traffic flows and user demographics, followed by the design of a flexible system that can adapt over time.",
    "**Environmental Impact**: While the goal may be to create a more sustainable transportation system, the construction and implementation phases can have significant environmental impacts, such as habitat disruption or increased pollution. To address this, the city could adopt a \"green construction\" policy that mandates eco-friendly materials and methods. Additionally, implementing a reforestation plan to offset any environmental damage could serve as a proactive measure.",
    "**Technological Challenges**: Implementing new technology, such as real-time tracking systems or electric buses, can present significant challenges, including system integration issues, staff training, and cybersecurity risks. To mitigate these problems, the city could partner with tech companies to pilot the technology in phases, allowing for troubleshooting and adjustments based on real-world data before a full rollout.",
    "**Accessibility for All Users**: A major issue in public transportation overhauls is ensuring that the system is accessible to everyone, including those with disabilities, the elderly, and low-income populations. To address this, the city could involve advocacy groups in the planning process and design features like low-floor buses, audio announcements, and affordable fare structures. Additionally, creating a “mobility ambassador” program where trained volunteers assist individuals in navigating the new system can foster inclusivity."
