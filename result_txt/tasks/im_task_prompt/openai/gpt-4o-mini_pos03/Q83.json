    "**Modular Design with Adjustable Compartments**: Create a shopping cart with a modular design that allows users to adjust the size and shape of compartments based on their shopping needs. For example, the cart could have removable dividers that can be rearranged to create larger sections for bulk items or smaller sections for delicate products. This flexibility would cater to a variety of shopping experiences, from grocery runs to clothing purchases.",
    "**Eco-Friendly Materials and Solar Charging**: Design a shopping cart made from sustainable, biodegradable materials. Additionally, incorporate solar panels on the cart's handle that can charge small devices like smartphones or provide power for built-in LED lights for visibility in dimly lit areas. This eco-conscious approach would appeal to environmentally aware consumers and enhance functionality.",
    "**Integrated Shopping List and Navigation System**: Equip the shopping cart with a digital interface that allows shoppers to input their shopping list. The cart could then provide a guided route through the store, highlighting the locations of items and suggesting alternatives based on availability or sales. This system could be connected to store inventory, providing real-time updates on stock levels and helping customers save time.",
    "**Personalized Shopping Experience with AI Assistance**: Develop a shopping cart with an AI assistant that learns a shopper's preferences over time. This AI could suggest items based on previous purchases, dietary restrictions, or current promotions. It could also recommend recipes based on the items in the cart, making grocery shopping more interactive and tailored to individual needs.",
    "**Health and Safety Features**: Integrate health monitoring technology into the shopping cart, such as a UV light sanitization system that disinfects items as they are placed in the cart. Additionally, add a touchless interface for operating the cart's features, minimizing contact with surfaces. These enhancements would provide peace of mind to health-conscious consumers, especially in the wake of increased awareness around hygiene."
