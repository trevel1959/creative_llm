    "**DIY Air Freshener**: Create a natural air freshener by filling a coffee filter with dried herbs, spices, or essential oils. Tie it up with a string or rubber band, and hang it in closets, cars, or other spaces that need a fresh scent. The filter allows the fragrance to permeate while keeping the contents contained.",
    "**Screen for Small Parts**: Use coffee filters as a makeshift screen when working with small parts, such as beads or screws. Place the filter in a bowl or container to catch any small items that might roll away. The fine mesh of the filter prevents tiny pieces from escaping while allowing for easy visibility.",
    "**Dusting Cloth**: Coffee filters are perfect for dusting surfaces. Their lint-free quality makes them ideal for cleaning glass, furniture, and electronics without leaving behind any residue or fibers. Just use them dry or slightly dampened with a cleaning solution for an effective clean.",
    "**Cooking Food Packets**: When cooking delicate items like fish or vegetables, use coffee filters to create cooking packets. Place the food and seasonings in the center of the filter, fold it over, and secure it with kitchen twine. This method allows for steaming without direct contact with the pan, preserving moisture and flavor.",
    "**Emergency First Aid**: In a pinch, coffee filters can serve as a sterile dressing for minor cuts and scrapes. Their absorbent material can help stop bleeding and protect the wound until proper medical attention can be sought. Always ensure the filter is clean and free from any contaminants before use."
