    "Guitar Pedalboard: Design a pedalboard that can be mounted on the guitar's body or neck. This would allow the player to easily switch between effects without having to bend down and use a separate pedalboard. The pedalboard could also include LED lights to indicate the current effect settings.",
    "Guitar Pick Sampler: Create a guitar pick sampler that allows the player to quickly switch between different pick sizes and materials. This would be especially useful for guitarists who play in multiple styles or have different preferences for certain songs.",
    "Guitar Strap Buddy: Develop a guitar strap buddy that attaches to the guitar's body and strap, providing extra support and preventing the strap from swinging around during performance. The strap buddy could also include a built-in clip for attaching additional accessories, such as a microphone or guitar pick.",
    "Guitar Tuner Clip: Design a guitar tuner clip that can be attached to the guitar's body or neck. This would allow the player to quickly check the tuning without having to look down at the strings. The clip could also include LED lights to indicate the current pitch.",
    "Guitar Stand Upgrade: Upgrade the traditional guitar stand by adding a built-in music stand and a small speaker. This would allow the player to easily read sheet music and listen to backing tracks while playing. The stand could also include a small USB port for charging devices."
