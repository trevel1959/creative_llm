    "**Inverted Human-Powered Wheelchair**: This idea involves creating a specialized wheelchair that moves in reverse. The user would sit facing backward while controlling the direction of movement through foot pedals. The design would include an inverted seat and steering mechanism to allow for comfortable and intuitive control. The confidence score for this idea is 0.9.",
    "**Reverse-Wheel Bicycle**: Instead of pedaling forward, this bicycle would have the rider facing backward and the wheels turning in reverse to propel the bike forward. It would require new design considerations for stability and balance. The confidence score for this idea is 0.85.",
    "**Reverse-Moving Treadmill**: A treadmill that runs backward could allow users to run or walk in reverse, potentially offering unique physical challenges and benefits. The treadmill would need modifications to ensure safety and proper foot placement. The confidence score for this idea is 0.9.",
    "**Reverse-Powered Skates**: Skates with reverse-propulsion technology, like jet skis but on wheels, could enable movement in reverse by shooting water or air backward. This concept would involve advanced engineering and could be particularly useful in aquatic environments or for urban exploration. The confidence score for this idea is 0.8.",
    "**Reversed-Direction Parachute**: A parachute designed specifically for descending backward would allow individuals to glide upwards or sideways instead of falling straight down. This would require a different shape, orientation, and possibly additional stabilizing features. The confidence score for this idea is 0.75."
