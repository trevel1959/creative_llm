    "**Modular Storage Solutions**: Design a bicycle with a modular storage system that allows users to easily attach and detach various compartments. These could include a weatherproof backpack, a cooler for food and drinks, or a secure compartment for tools and repair kits. The compartments would have quick-release mechanisms for convenience and could be customized based on the user's needs for commuting, touring, or recreational rides.",
    "**Adaptive Suspension System**: Create a bicycle with an adaptive suspension system that automatically adjusts based on terrain and rider weight. This would involve sensors that detect bumps and uneven surfaces, allowing the bike to provide a smoother ride on rough trails while remaining efficient on flat roads. Riders could also manually adjust settings for a personalized experience.",
    "**Eco-Friendly Materials**: Innovate a bicycle made from sustainable and biodegradable materials, such as bamboo or recycled plastics. This would not only reduce the carbon footprint associated with traditional bike manufacturing but also promote eco-consciousness among riders. The bike could also feature a paint finish made from natural dyes to further enhance its environmental appeal.",
    "**Integrated Safety Features**: Develop a bicycle with integrated safety features such as automatic lights that activate when it gets dark, reflective materials on the frame and tires, and a built-in alarm system that alerts the owner via smartphone if the bike is tampered with. Additionally, a rearview camera could provide live footage to help riders stay aware of their surroundings.",
    "**Customizable Frame Geometry**: Introduce a bicycle with a customizable frame geometry that allows riders to adjust the size and shape of the bike according to their preferences or riding style. This could be achieved through a series of adjustable joints and components, making it suitable for various body types and purposes, whether itâ€™s for racing, commuting, or leisure."
