    "**Smart Gesture Recognition**: Incorporate advanced gesture recognition technology into the mouse, allowing users to perform specific actions by moving their hands in the air near the mouse or by using specific finger gestures on the mouse surface. This would enable functionalities like scrolling, zooming, or switching applications without clicking, making multitasking smoother and more intuitive.",
    "**Integrated Wireless Charging Pad**: Create a mouse that features an integrated wireless charging pad on its base. This would allow users to simply place the mouse on the pad when not in use to keep it charged without the hassle of cords. The charging pad could also be designed to charge other devices, like smartphones or tablets, when the mouse is not on it.",
    "**Adaptive Sensitivity and DPI Adjustment**: Introduce a mouse that can automatically adjust its sensitivity and DPI (dots per inch) based on the task being performed. For instance, it could switch to a higher DPI for precise graphic design work and lower it for general browsing. Users could also manually set profiles for different applications that the mouse would recognize and switch to automatically.",
    "**Built-in Voice Assistant Integration**: Equip the mouse with a built-in voice assistant feature that allows users to control their computer using voice commands. This could be particularly useful for accessibility purposes, allowing users to perform tasks like opening applications, searching the web, or even dictating text without needing to click or type.",
    "**Modular Functionality**: Design a modular mouse that allows users to add or remove components based on their needs. For example, users could attach additional buttons for gaming or graphic design, or even swap in a mini touchscreen for quick access to shortcuts and settings. This adaptability would make the mouse suitable for various tasks and preferences."
