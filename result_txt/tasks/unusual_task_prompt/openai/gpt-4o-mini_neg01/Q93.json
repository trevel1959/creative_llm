    "**Candle Holder**: Use a vase as an unconventional candle holder. Place a pillar candle inside a wider vase or fill a narrow vase with sand or pebbles to stabilize a tapered candle. This can create a beautiful, ambient lighting effect and can be easily customized by changing the vase or the type of candle used.",
    "**Kitchen Utensil Organizer**: Transform a vase into a stylish kitchen utensil holder. Instead of cluttering your countertop with various utensils, use a vase to neatly organize spatulas, wooden spoons, and whisks. This adds a decorative touch to your kitchen while keeping your tools easily accessible.",
    "**Gift Wrap Alternative**: Instead of traditional gift wrapping, use a vase as a unique gift container. Fill the vase with small gifts, candies, or flowers, and then wrap it in clear cellophane or a decorative cloth. This not only serves as the gift itself but also provides the recipient with a beautiful vase they can use afterward.",
    "**Bird Feeder**: Turn a sturdy vase into a bird feeder by inverting it and attaching it to a platform or tree branch. Fill the vase with birdseed, allowing birds to perch on the edge while they feed. This can attract local wildlife to your garden and provide an enjoyable view from your window.",
    "**Flower Press**: Use a vase to create a makeshift flower press. Place flowers between two pieces of cardboard and sandwich them inside the vase, then weigh it down with heavy books. This method allows you to preserve the beauty of flowers for use in crafts, scrapbooking, or home decor."
