    "Smart Coat Rack: Create a coat rack with a built-in charging station for your devices. Incorporate USB ports and wireless charging pads into the design, allowing you to charge your phone, tablet, or watch while hanging your coat. The charging stations could be hidden behind sliding doors or panels for a sleek, modern look.",
    "Shape-Shifting Coat Rack: Design a coat rack that can change its shape to accommodate different types of coats and accessories. For example, a hinged design could allow the rack to expand or contract to accommodate long or short coats, while a magnetic base could hold different types of accessories like hats, scarves, or bags.",
    "Interactive Coat Rack: Create a coat rack with sensors and actuators that allow it to interact with you and your belongings. For example, the rack could light up when you approach, or it could automatically hang up your coat when you enter the room. You could also program the rack to recognize specific items and provide personalized recommendations, such as suggesting a hat to match your outfit or reminding you to grab your umbrella before leaving the house.",
    "Multifunctional Coat Rack: Design a coat rack that serves multiple purposes. For example, it could double as a shoe rack, a storage container for bags or briefcases, or even a small table or bench. The rack could have adjustable shelves or compartments to accommodate different sizes and shapes of items, and it could be made from durable materials like wood or metal to ensure longevity.",
    "Transformative Coat Rack: Create a coat rack that can transform into different shapes or functions. For example, it could start as a traditional coat rack but then transform into a coat tree, a coat hanger with built-in hooks, or even a coat-themed sculpture. The transformation could be achieved through a combination of materials, such as interchangeable components or a modular design, allowing you to customize the rack to suit your needs and preferences."
