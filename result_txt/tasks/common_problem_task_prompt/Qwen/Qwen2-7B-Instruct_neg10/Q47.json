    "**Incompatible Components**: Another issue might be compatibility between different parts. For instance, certain motherboards may not support specific CPU models or graphics cards. Careful research and checking compatibility charts on manufacturers' websites can prevent this headache. Ensuring all components have compatible power connectors and slot types (like PCIe for GPUs) is essential too.",
    "**Cost Overruns**: Budgeting for building a computer can quickly spiral out of control. It's easy to underestimate costs, especially when considering the price of high-end components. Creating a detailed list of all required parts and their estimated costs upfront can help manage expectations and finances. Prioritizing essential components while being flexible with others can keep the build affordable without compromising too much on performance.",
    "**Assembly Skills**: For someone new to building computers, the assembly process can be daunting and error-prone. Incorrect installation of components like the motherboard, RAM, or hard drive can cause issues such as boot failures or system instability. Taking time to read manuals, watching tutorial videos, and possibly seeking guidance from experienced builders can significantly reduce the likelihood of mistakes.",
    "**Power Supply Issues**: A weak or poorly connected power supply can lead to inconsistent performance, hardware damage, or system instability. It's crucial to choose a reliable power supply with enough wattage to accommodate all components, and ensure it's properly connected to the motherboard and other peripherals. Using a surge protector or uninterruptible power supply (UPS) can also provide an extra layer of protection against unexpected power fluctuations.",
    "**Software Compatibility and Installation**: After assembling the hardware, installing operating systems and software can present challenges, particularly with older or less common components. Compatibility issues with drivers, BIOS updates, or specific software requirements might need troubleshooting. Regularly checking for the latest updates and support resources from component manufacturers can mitigate these problems."
