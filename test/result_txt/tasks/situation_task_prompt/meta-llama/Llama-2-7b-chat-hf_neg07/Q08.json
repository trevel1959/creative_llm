    "Create a Water Filtration System Using Nanotechnology: Develop a water filtration system that utilizes nanotechnology to remove pollutants and contaminants from water. This system would use tiny nanoparticles to capture and remove impurities, resulting in clean and safe drinking water. The nanoparticles could be made from materials such as activated carbon or silver, which are effective at removing harmful substances from water.",
    "Use Solar-Powered Water Distillation: Design a water distillation system that uses solar energy to purify water. The system would use the heat from the sun to evaporate water, and then condense the water vapor back into a clean and pure liquid. This method would be effective in areas with access to sunlight, making it a sustainable and reliable way to obtain clean drinking water.",
    "Create a Water-Scarce Ecosystem: Develop a self-sustaining ecosystem that can produce clean drinking water in areas with limited access to water sources. This ecosystem would utilize a combination of natural processes, such as evaporation, condensation, and filtration, to purify water. The ecosystem could be powered by renewable energy sources, such as wind or solar power, and could be maintained through a series of interconnected systems that promote water conservation and recycling.",
    "Develop a Water-Harvesting System: Design a system that collects and stores rainwater for use as clean drinking water. This system would involve the construction of large, underground storage tanks that can collect and store rainwater during periods of heavy rainfall. The water could then be filtered and purified for use as drinking water. This system would be particularly effective in areas with high levels of rainfall, but limited access to other sources of water.",
    "Create a Bio-Based Water Purification System: Develop a water purification system that uses living organisms to clean water. This system would involve the use of microorganisms that can break down and remove impurities from water, resulting in clean and safe drinking water. The microorganisms could be genetically engineered to target specific contaminants, making the system highly effective and efficient. This system would be a sustainable and environmentally friendly way to purify water"
