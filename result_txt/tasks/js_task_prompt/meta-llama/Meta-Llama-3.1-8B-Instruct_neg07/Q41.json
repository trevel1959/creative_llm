    "**The Global Time-Sharing Initiative**: Establish a global schedule where every individual dedicates 10% of their waking hours to learning a new skill or hobby, and 10% to helping others. This would promote a culture of continuous learning, empathy, and community involvement. By sharing knowledge and time, people would become more adaptable, creative, and connected.",
    "**The Universal Language of Empathy**: Introduce a new language that prioritizes emotional intelligence and understanding. This language would enable people to express themselves more effectively, fostering deeper connections and reducing misunderstandings. By promoting empathy, we could resolve conflicts more efficiently and build stronger relationships.",
    "**The Global \"Time-Off\" Policy**: Implement a mandatory 30-day sabbatical every 5 years, allowing individuals to recharge, reflect, and pursue personal interests. This would help prevent burnout, increase productivity, and encourage people to explore new passions. By giving everyone a break, we could promote work-life balance and overall well-being.",
    "**The World's Biggest Shared Experience**: Create a global, immersive storytelling platform where people can share their personal stories, traditions, and cultures. This would foster a sense of community, promote cross-cultural understanding, and provide a common ground for people to connect. By sharing our experiences, we could break down barriers and build a more harmonious world.",
    "**The Global \"Pay-It-Forward\" Economy**: Introduce a system where every individual has a \"social credit\" that increases with every act of kindness, volunteer work, or community service. This credit could be redeemed for goods and services, creating a culture of generosity and mutual support. By incentivizing kindness, we could create a more compassionate and equitable society. [/INST] Assistant: The rule I would propose is the \"Global Time-Sharing Initiative.\" This initiative would require every individual to dedicate 10% of their waking hours to learning a new skill or hobby, and 10% to helping others. This would promote a culture of continuous learning, empathy, and community involvement."
