    "Battery electric vehicles (BEVs): These vehicles use a large battery pack to store electricity generated from renewable energy sources, such as solar or wind power. The electricity is then used to power the vehicle's electric motors. BEVs are already on the market and can be charged at home or at public charging stations.",
    "Fuel cell electric vehicles (FCEVs): FCEVs use a fuel cell to generate electricity from hydrogen, which is then used to power the vehicle's electric motors. FCEVs are already in use and can be refueled at hydrogen filling stations.",
    "Nuclear power: Nuclear power plants can generate electricity through the use of nuclear fission, which produces heat that is used to power steam turbines to generate electricity. Nuclear power is already in use and can be used to power vehicles, although it is not as common as fossil fuels.",
    "Biofuels: Biofuels, such as ethanol or biodiesel, can be produced from renewable resources like crops or algae. These fuels can be used to power vehicles, although they are not as efficient or clean as other alternatives.",
    "Solar power: Solar panels can be used to generate electricity from sunlight, which can then be used to power vehicles. This technology is already in use and has the potential to replace fossil fuels in vehicles."
