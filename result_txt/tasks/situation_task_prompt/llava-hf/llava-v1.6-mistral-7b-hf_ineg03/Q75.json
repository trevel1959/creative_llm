    "Electric vehicles: Electric vehicles would become more prevalent as the demand for oil decreases. Governments and private companies would invest in expanding the charging infrastructure and developing more efficient and affordable electric vehicles. This would require a significant increase in the production of renewable energy sources such as wind, hydro, and geothermal to power the electric grid.",
    "Hydrogen fuel cells: Hydrogen fuel cells could be used to power vehicles, as they produce only water as a byproduct. Hydrogen can be produced from water through a process called electrolysis, which requires electricity. This would require a significant increase in renewable energy production to meet the demand for hydrogen fuel cells.",
    "Biofuels: Biofuels, such as ethanol and biodiesel, could become more widely used as a replacement for oil. These fuels are derived from plant materials, such as corn and soybeans, and can be produced sustainably. However, this would require significant land use changes and the development of more efficient and cost-effective production methods.",
    "Nuclear power: Nuclear power plants could be used to generate electricity to power vehicles. This would require significant investments in nuclear infrastructure and safety measures, as well as the development of more efficient and safer nuclear reactors.",
    "Magnetic levitation: Magnetic levitation, or maglev, technology could be used to power vehicles by using magnetic forces to levitate and propel them. This would require significant investments in infrastructure, such as maglev tracks, and the development of more efficient and affordable maglev vehicles."
