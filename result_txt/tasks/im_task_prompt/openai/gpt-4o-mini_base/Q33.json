    "**Self-Cleaning Mechanism**: Design a blender with a built-in self-cleaning feature that uses high-pressure water jets and specialized cleaning solutions. After use, users could simply add water and the cleaning solution, press a button, and the blender would clean itself, ensuring hygiene and saving time on manual cleaning.",
    "**Interchangeable Blades and Jars**: Introduce a modular design where users can easily swap out blades and jars based on their needs. For instance, a blade specifically designed for smoothies, another for chopping nuts, and a jar thatâ€™s insulated for hot soups. This customization would enhance versatility and improve blending efficiency for various recipes.",
    "**Soundproofing Technology**: Develop a blender with advanced soundproofing materials and design to minimize noise during operation. This would be especially beneficial for early morning or late-night blending, allowing users to enjoy their smoothies or soups without disturbing others in the household.",
    "**Eco-Friendly Materials and Energy Efficiency**: Create a blender made from sustainable, biodegradable materials and incorporate energy-efficient motors. This design would appeal to environmentally conscious consumers and reduce the overall carbon footprint of the product. Additionally, it could feature a power-saving mode that automatically turns off after a set time of inactivity.",
    "**Augmented Reality (AR) Guidance**: Implement an AR feature that uses a companion app to guide users through blending techniques and recipes. Users could point their smartphone or AR glasses at the blender, and the app would overlay instructions, ingredient quantities, and tips directly onto their view, making the blending process interactive and educational."
