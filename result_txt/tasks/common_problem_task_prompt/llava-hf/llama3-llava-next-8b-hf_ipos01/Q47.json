    "Overheating: Another issue that can arise when building a computer from scratch is overheating. Overheating can be caused by inadequate cooling systems, such as insufficient air vents, blocked air vents, or malfunctioning fans. Overheating can lead to reduced performance, crashes, and even hardware failure.",
    "Poor cable management: Proper cable management is essential for a clean and organized build. However, if cables are not managed well, it can lead to tangled wires, reduced airflow, and an overall cluttered appearance. This can also be a potential fire hazard.",
    "Power supply issues: A computer's power supply is crucial to its operation. If the power supply is not strong enough or if the components are not connected properly, it can lead to power surges, crashes, or hardware failure.",
    "Inadequate cooling for high-performance components: High-performance components, such as graphics cards and processors, generate a lot of heat. If the cooling system is not adequate, it can lead to overheating and reduced performance.",
    "Incorrect installation of components: When building a computer from scratch, it's essential to follow the instructions for each component. If a component is not installed correctly, it can lead to hardware issues, such as the fan not spinning or the hard drive not functioning."
