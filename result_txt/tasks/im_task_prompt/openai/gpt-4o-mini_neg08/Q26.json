    "**Odor Neutralizing System**: Develop a trash can with an integrated odor neutralizing system. This could involve a combination of activated charcoal filters and a small fan that circulates air, reducing unpleasant smells. Additionally, a small compartment could hold natural deodorizers like essential oils or citrus peels, releasing pleasant scents when the lid is opened, making the trash can more appealing for indoor use.",
    "**Compacting Trash Can**: Create a trash can that features a built-in compactor. With a simple press of a button, the compactor would compress the waste, allowing for more efficient use of space. This would reduce the frequency of emptying the can and help users feel accomplished as they see their trash reduced significantly. An LED indicator could signal when the can is full and needs to be emptied.",
    "**Interactive Trash Can for Kids**: Design a fun, interactive trash can aimed at children, encouraging them to dispose of waste properly. This could include a digital screen that rewards kids with points or virtual stickers for recycling or throwing away trash correctly. The trash can could also feature fun sounds or animations that play when they use it correctly, making the process engaging and educational.",
    "**Solar-Powered Trash Can with Charging Station**: Create a trash can that is solar-powered and features a built-in charging station for small devices. The top of the trash can could have a solar panel that powers USB ports, allowing users to charge their phones or other devices while on the go. This would be particularly useful in public spaces like parks, where people often need to dispose of trash and charge their devices simultaneously.",
    "**Personalized Trash Can with Mood Lighting**: Design a trash can that incorporates customizable LED mood lighting. Users could choose the color and intensity of the light based on their mood or the time of day. For instance, a calming blue light could indicate it's time for recycling, while a bright red light could signal that the trash needs to be taken out. This feature would add a decorative element to the trash can while providing functional cues."
