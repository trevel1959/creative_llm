    "**Solar-Powered Indoor Parks**: Design large indoor parks equipped with advanced solar panels that collect and store sunlight during rare sunny moments. These parks would feature artificial skylights that can simulate sunlight using a combination of LED technology and light filters that replicate the spectrum of natural sunlight. People could escape the dreary weather and enjoy activities like picnics, yoga, or simply lounging under “sun” rays, enhancing mental well-being.",
    "**Cloud-Catching Drones**: Develop a fleet of drones designed to capture and convert moisture from the clouds into energy. These drones could be equipped with solar panels and condensation systems that harvest water vapor and convert it into hydrogen fuel. The energy generated could then be used to power indoor lighting systems that mimic the warmth and brightness of sunlight, ensuring homes and businesses remain well-lit and cheerful.",
    "**Mood-Enhancing Light Therapy Pods**: Create portable light therapy pods that individuals can use at home or in public spaces. These pods would be equipped with customizable LED lights that simulate the full spectrum of sunlight, allowing users to adjust the intensity and color temperature based on their preferences. Incorporating aromatherapy and soundscapes, these pods would provide a holistic approach to combating the effects of a cloudy sky, promoting relaxation and mental clarity.",
    "**Sky Mirrors**: Construct large, movable sky mirrors that can be strategically placed to reflect and concentrate any available sunlight into designated areas. These mirrors would be made from lightweight, reflective materials and could be adjusted throughout the day to maximize sunlight capture. They could be used in parks, rooftops, or community spaces, creating bright spots where people can gather, socialize, and engage in outdoor activities.",
    "**Indoor Sunlight Simulation Hubs**: Establish community hubs that offer immersive sunlight simulation experiences. These hubs would feature advanced technology, such as full-spectrum light therapy systems, virtual reality environments with sunlit landscapes, and interactive displays about the benefits of sunlight. These spaces would serve as social gathering points where people can come together to enjoy simulated sunlight, engage in wellness activities, and foster community connections."
