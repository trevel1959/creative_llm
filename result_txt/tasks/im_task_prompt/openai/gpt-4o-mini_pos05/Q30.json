    "**Air Quality Monitoring and Purification**: Equip the air conditioner with advanced sensors that not only measure temperature and humidity but also monitor air quality, including pollutants and allergens. When poor air quality is detected, the system can activate an integrated air purification mode, utilizing HEPA filters and UV-C light technology to cleanse the air before circulating it.",
    "**Eco-Friendly Refrigerant Alternatives**: Research and develop air conditioners that utilize natural refrigerants, such as hydrocarbons or CO2, which have a lower global warming potential than traditional refrigerants. This change would not only make air conditioners more environmentally friendly but could also enhance their efficiency and performance.",
    "**Personalized Cooling Zones**: Design air conditioning units that allow for individualized temperature settings in different rooms or zones of a house. This could be achieved through the use of smart vents that can be controlled via a mobile app, allowing occupants to customize their comfort levels without affecting the entire homeâ€™s climate.",
    "**Solar-Powered AC Units**: Create air conditioning systems that are powered by solar energy, either through integrated solar panels or compatibility with existing solar setups. This would reduce electricity costs and dependence on fossil fuels, making cooling more sustainable. Additionally, the system could store excess energy for use during peak hours.",
    "**Sound Dampening Technology**: Develop air conditioning units with enhanced soundproofing features to minimize noise pollution. This could include acoustic insulation materials and advanced fan designs that reduce operational noise, making it ideal for bedrooms or quiet spaces where silence is valued."
