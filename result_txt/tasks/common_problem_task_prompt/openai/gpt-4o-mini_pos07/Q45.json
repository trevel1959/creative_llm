    "**Logistical Challenges**: Coordinating travel, accommodation, and venue arrangements for a large number of international delegates can be overwhelming. To address this, a dedicated logistics team should be established, utilizing project management software to track arrangements and deadlines. Additionally, having a contingency plan for unexpected issues like flight delays or venue changes would ensure smooth operations.",
    "**Security Concerns**: High-profile events attract attention, which can lead to security threats. The organizing committee should collaborate with local law enforcement and security experts to conduct risk assessments. Implementing stringent security measures, including access control, surveillance, and emergency protocols, would help ensure the safety of all participants.",
    "**Diverse Political Agendas**: Different countries may have conflicting political interests, which can hinder constructive dialogue. To navigate this, the summit could include pre-summit consultations with representatives to identify common ground and set a collaborative agenda. Facilitators trained in conflict resolution could guide discussions, ensuring that all voices are heard while steering the conversation towards shared goals.",
    "**Language Barriers**: Language differences can create communication challenges, potentially leading to misinterpretations. To overcome this, the summit could provide professional interpreters and multilingual materials. Additionally, incorporating technology such as real-time translation apps could enhance understanding and participation among delegates.",
    "**Engagement of Youth and Grassroots Voices**: International summits often prioritize governmental representatives, sidelining the perspectives of youth and grassroots organizations. To ensure inclusivity, the organizing committee could host parallel events or workshops for these groups, encouraging their participation in the main summit through presentations or panels. This would enrich discussions and provide a broader range of insights."
