    "**Sustainable Energy Infrastructure**: The city would be powered by a combination of renewable energy sources, including solar, wind, and hydroelectric power. Energy-efficient buildings and green spaces would be integrated into the city's design, reducing energy consumption and carbon emissions. A smart grid system would manage energy distribution, ensuring that energy is used efficiently and minimizing waste.",
    "**Autonomous Transportation System**: The city would feature an autonomous transportation system, with self-driving cars, buses, and hyperloops connecting different parts of the city. This would reduce traffic congestion, decrease emissions, and increase mobility for citizens, especially the elderly and those with disabilities.",
    "**Advanced Water Management**: The city would implement a cutting-edge water management system, harvesting and recycling rainwater, greywater, and blackwater to minimize wastewater and reduce the strain on municipal water supplies. This would also reduce the city's reliance on external water sources, ensuring a sustainable water supply for its citizens.",
    "**Innovative Waste Management**: The city would adopt a zero-waste policy, with a comprehensive waste management system that includes recycling, composting, and waste-to-energy conversion. This would minimize landfill waste, reduce greenhouse gas emissions, and create a cleaner, healthier environment for citizens.",
    "**Inclusive and Accessible Public Spaces**: The city would prioritize inclusive and accessible public spaces, with wheelchair-accessible buildings, pedestrian-friendly streets, and public transportation that accommodates all abilities. This would ensure that all citizens, regardless of age or ability, can participate fully in city life and enjoy its amenities."
