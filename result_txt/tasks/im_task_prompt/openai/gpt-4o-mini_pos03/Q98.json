    "**Self-Cleaning Mechanism**: Incorporate a self-cleaning feature into the juicer that uses high-pressure steam or a rotating brush system. After juicing, the user can simply add water and press a button, activating the cleaning cycle. This would eliminate the hassle of disassembling and scrubbing, making the juicing process more convenient and encouraging more frequent use.",
    "**Modular Design with Attachments**: Create a juicer with a modular design that allows users to swap out different attachments for various functions, such as a smoothie blender, nut milk maker, or even a food processor. This versatility would make the juicer a multi-functional kitchen appliance, catering to a wider range of culinary needs and reducing the need for multiple gadgets.",
    "**Eco-Friendly Materials and Zero Waste**: Design the juicer using sustainable materials, such as bamboo or recycled plastics, and implement a zero-waste philosophy. The juicer could include a built-in compartment for collecting pulp, which can be used for composting or as an ingredient in other recipes, promoting sustainability and reducing kitchen waste.",
    "**Integrated Cold Press Technology**: Innovate a juicer that combines traditional centrifugal juicing with cold press technology. This hybrid approach would allow users to choose between quick juicing or a more nutrient-preserving method, depending on their time constraints and health priorities. An intuitive switch could let users toggle between the two methods easily.",
    "**Personalized Juice Nutrient Analyzer**: Introduce a feature that analyzes the nutritional content of the juice being produced in real-time. Using sensors, the juicer could provide feedback on vitamin levels, sugar content, and overall health benefits, helping users make informed decisions about their juice consumption and encouraging healthier choices."
