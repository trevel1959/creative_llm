    "The ecosystem would collapse: Insects play a crucial role in pollination, decomposition, and nutrient cycling. Without them, plants would struggle to reproduce, and the food chain would be severely disrupted.",
    "Ecosystems would shift: The loss of insects would lead to a shift in the dominance of plant species, as those that rely on insects for pollination or seed dispersal would struggle to survive. This could result in a loss of biodiversity and the takeover of invasive species.",
    "The food chain would be impacted: Insects are an essential food source for many animals, from birds and bats to reptiles and amphibians. Without them, these animals would need to find alternative sources of food, leading to a ripple effect throughout the food chain.",
    "Soil health would decline: Insects help break down organic matter and recycle nutrients in the soil. Without them, soil health would decline, leading to a decrease in plant growth and fertility.",
    "The global economy would be affected: Insects play a significant role in agriculture, pollinating crops and pest control. Without them, food production would decline, leading to economic losses and food shortages."
