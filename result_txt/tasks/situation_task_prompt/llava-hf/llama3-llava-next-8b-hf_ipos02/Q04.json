    "**Bioengineering**: Develop genetically engineered trees that grow faster and more efficiently, requiring fewer resources to produce the same amount of wood and biomass. This would help to maintain a balance between resource production and sustainability.",
    "**Agroforestry**: Promote agroforestry practices, where trees are integrated into agricultural systems. This would maximize land use efficiency, provide shade and erosion control, and improve soil health.",
    "**Carbon Capture and Utilization**: Develop technologies that capture carbon dioxide from the atmosphere and convert it into usable resources such as chemicals, fuels, or building materials. This would help to mitigate the effects of climate change while providing new sources of raw materials.",
    "**Circular Economy**: Implement a circular economy approach to resource management, where materials are continuously cycled and reused. This would reduce the demand for new resources and minimize waste.",
    "**Biorefineries**: Establish biorefineries that convert biomass into various products, such as paper, textiles, and chemicals. This would allow for the continued production of goods while reducing the reliance on fossil fuels."
