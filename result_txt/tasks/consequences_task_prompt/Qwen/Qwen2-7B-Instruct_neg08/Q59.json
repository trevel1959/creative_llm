    "**Universal Creativity Boost**: If everyone suddenly became geniuses, society would experience an unprecedented surge in creativity across all fields - from art to science, engineering to literature. People would be able to develop groundbreaking technologies, solve complex problems in seconds, and create works of art that could rival the most famous masterpieces. This could lead to rapid advancements in human civilization, potentially surpassing what we've seen over centuries.",
    "**Education System Overhaul**: With everyone being equally gifted, traditional educational systems might become obsolete. Schools could transform into more communal learning spaces where people can collaborate on projects and learn from each other directly. Specialized areas of study would emerge based on personal interests, leading to a highly specialized yet interconnected society. ",
    "**Psychological Impact**: The sudden influx of genius might lead to societal pressure to constantly innovate and achieve at the highest level. Individuals may struggle with maintaining productivity without experiencing feelings of inadequacy or envy when compared to peers. This could lead to mental health challenges such as anxiety and depression, necessitating widespread support systems to address these issues.",
    "**Economic Shifts**: The economy would need to adapt to the new reality of a workforce composed entirely of highly skilled individuals. Jobs might shift towards more creative and less routine tasks, requiring higher education and training for many positions. This could lead to a reevaluation of job roles and societal value placed on different skills, potentially leading to a more equitable distribution of wealth and resources.",
    "**Ethical Dilemmas**: With everyone being equally intelligent, questions about fairness and meritocracy might arise. For instance, who decides what constitutes genius, and how is it distributed? Would there be a push for a universal intelligence test or criteria to ensure equal opportunities for all? These discussions could lead to ethical debates about the nature of intelligence, creativity, and the value of human potential."
