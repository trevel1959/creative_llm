    "**Modular Bread Box with Adjustable Compartments**: Design a bread box with removable and adjustable compartments that can accommodate different types of bread and baked goods. Users can customize the size of each compartment based on their needs, whether it’s for baguettes, loaves, or rolls. This would maximize space efficiency and prevent squishing or stale bread.",
    "**Integrated Slicing Station**: Create a bread box that features a built-in slicing mechanism. Users can simply slide the loaf into the box, and with the press of a button, a sharp, retractable blade slices the bread evenly. This would ensure perfect slices every time, reducing mess and providing convenience for sandwiches or toast.",
    "**Eco-Friendly Bread Box with Biodegradable Materials**: Develop a bread box made from sustainable, biodegradable materials that not only looks stylish but also reduces environmental impact. The box could be designed to be compostable after its life cycle, and it could feature a design that encourages users to store their bread in a way that minimizes waste, such as a built-in bag for crusts.",
    "**Interactive Recipe Companion**: Incorporate a touchscreen interface on the bread box that suggests recipes based on the type of bread stored inside. For example, if you have sourdough, the box could suggest recipes for sourdough croutons, bread pudding, or sandwiches. Users could also input their preferences to receive personalized recipe suggestions.",
    "**Dual-Purpose Bread Box with Warmer Functionality**: Create a bread box that can double as a bread warmer. With a built-in heating element, users can choose to keep their bread warm while it’s stored. This feature would be especially useful for serving fresh bread at family dinners or gatherings, ensuring the bread is always at the perfect temperature."
