    "**Ecosystem Shift**: The sudden change would lead to an explosion of aquatic life, as species adapted to freshwater environments would thrive. New species, such as giant freshwater fish and aquatic mammals, would emerge. However, this would also lead to the extinction of marine species that are adapted to saltwater environments. The coastal ecosystems, like mangroves and coral reefs, would be severely impacted, and their biodiversity would be lost.",
    "**Agricultural Boom**: Freshwater oceans would provide an abundance of water for irrigation, leading to a significant increase in crop yields and food production. This, in turn, would lead to a global population boom, as food would no longer be a scarce resource. However, this would also lead to overpopulation, resource depletion, and increased competition for land and resources.",
    "**Economic Revolution**: The transformation of the oceans would lead to a massive shift in the global economy. The fishing industry would collapse, but new industries would emerge, such as freshwater aquaculture and tourism. The increased availability of freshwater would also lead to the development of new technologies, such as advanced desalination and water treatment systems.",
    "**Climate Change Mitigation**: Freshwater oceans would have a lower surface temperature than saltwater oceans, which would lead to a decrease in global temperatures. This, in turn, would slow down the rate of climate change, allowing for a longer period of time to adapt and mitigate its effects. However, this would also lead to changes in global weather patterns, potentially leading to more frequent and severe storms.",
    "**Geological Consequences**: The transformation of the oceans would lead to a massive redistribution of minerals and nutrients, potentially causing earthquakes and volcanic eruptions as the Earth's crust adjusts to the new conditions. This would also lead to changes in the Earth's magnetic field, potentially affecting global navigation and communication systems. The increased availability of freshwater would also lead to the formation of new landmasses, as the ocean floor would be uplifted, creating new coastlines and altering global geography.
