    "Enhance Human Strength: I would redesign the human body to increase strength by enhancing muscle fibers and bone density. This could be achieved through genetic engineering or bio-mechanical augmentation.",
    "Improve Memory Retention: To enhance memory retention, I would redesign the brain to allow for better neural connections and more efficient information processing. This could involve adding new neurons or increasing the size of existing ones.",
    "Increase Lifespan: I would redesign the human body to increase lifespan by slowing down the aging process. This could be achieved through gene therapy or by creating new cells that can replace damaged ones.",
    "Enhance Vision: I would redesign the eyes to improve vision by allowing humans to see in different wavelengths of light and even into the infrared spectrum. This could be achieved through advanced optics or by creating new types of photoreceptors.",
    "Increase Intelligence: I would redesign the human body to increase intelligence by improving cognitive function and increasing the speed of information processing. This could be achieved through neuroplasticity or by creating new neural pathways in the brain."
