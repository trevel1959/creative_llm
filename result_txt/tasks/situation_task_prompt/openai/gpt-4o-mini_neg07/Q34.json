    "**Subsurface Irrigation with Condensation**: Create a subsurface irrigation system using buried, porous pipes that capture condensation from the soil. As the temperature fluctuates between day and night, moisture in the air condenses on the cooler surfaces of the pipes. This water can be slowly released into the soil, ensuring that plant roots have access to moisture even when rain is absent.",
    "**Aquaponics and Hydroponics Systems**: Set up an aquaponics or hydroponics system that recycles water. In aquaponics, fish waste provides nutrients for plants, while the plants filter and clean the water, which is then returned to the fish tank. Hydroponics uses nutrient-rich water directly for plant growth. Both systems require minimal water and can be managed indoors or in greenhouses, allowing for efficient plant watering without reliance on rain.",
    "**Water-Absorbing Gel Crystals**: Use water-absorbing polymer crystals that can be mixed into the soil. These crystals can absorb and retain moisture from the air or any available water source, releasing it slowly to the plants over time. This method reduces the need for frequent watering and can be especially useful in dry conditions, providing a reservoir of moisture directly in the root zone.",
    "**Dew Collection Systems**: Design a dew collection system using sloped surfaces that funnel morning dew into a storage container. These surfaces can be made from materials like metal or plastic that cool quickly overnight, promoting condensation. By strategically placing these surfaces in your garden, you can collect enough dew to water your plants regularly, taking advantage of natural atmospheric moisture.",
    "**Greywater Recycling**: Implement a greywater recycling system that collects water from sinks, showers, or washing machines. This water can be filtered and treated for use in watering plants. By using greywater, you reduce waste and provide a sustainable water source for your garden, ensuring that your plants remain hydrated even in the absence of rain."
