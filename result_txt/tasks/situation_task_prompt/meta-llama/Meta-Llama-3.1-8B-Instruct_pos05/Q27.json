    "**Smart Window Technology**: Develop a smart window system that can adjust its tint and transparency in response to the outdoor temperature. During hot summer days, the window would darken and reflect sunlight, keeping the interior cool. Conversely, during cold winter days, the window would become clear and allow more sunlight to enter, warming the space. This technology would be integrated with sensors to monitor the temperature and adjust the window's properties accordingly.",
    "**Personalized Climate Control**: Implement a personalized climate control system that uses AI to learn each individual's temperature preferences. This system would be integrated with wearable devices or smart home assistants to track the user's temperature comfort levels. Based on this data, the system would adjust the indoor temperature to create a comfortable environment for each person, taking into account their unique preferences.",
    "**Indoor Greenhouse**: Design an indoor greenhouse that uses natural ventilation and insulation to regulate the temperature. This structure would be equipped with plants that help purify the air and maintain a stable temperature. During hot days, the greenhouse would be shaded by a retractable awning or solar panels, while during cold nights, it would be heated by a radiant floor or ceiling.",
    "**Phase Change Materials**: Develop a building material that incorporates phase change materials (PCMs) to regulate the indoor temperature. PCMs would absorb and release heat energy as they change phase, maintaining a stable temperature within the building. This material would be integrated into walls, floors, and ceilings to create a temperature-stable environment.",
    "**Aquaponics and Evaporative Cooling**: Combine aquaponics (a system that raises fish and plants together in a symbiotic relationship) with evaporative cooling to create a self-sustaining temperature regulation system. The aquaponics system would provide a natural cooling effect, while the evaporative cooling system would use water to cool the air, reducing the need for traditional heating and cooling systems. This system would be integrated with a smart home system to monitor and adjust the temperature as needed. [/INST] [/INST] "
