    "**Innovative Clothing Display Stand**: Create a clothes hanger that doubles as a display stand for showcasing accessories or small clothing items like belts, scarves, or jewelry. This could be achieved by designing the hanger to have multiple hooks or arms that can hold various items. The design could be modular, allowing for the addition of different components to suit various accessory types. This not only provides a unique storage solution but also enhances the visual appeal of the space.",
    "**Sustainable Hanger Recycling Project**: Develop a hanger made from sustainable materials such as bamboo, reclaimed wood, or recycled plastic. This product would be environmentally friendly and appeal to consumers who are conscious about their environmental impact. The design could be sleek and modern, making it suitable for both casual and formal wear. Additionally, the project could include a recycling program where customers can send in old hangers to be repurposed into new ones, promoting a circular economy.",
    "**Adjustable Height Hanger**: Design a clothes hanger that can be adjusted to different heights. This would be particularly useful in multi-level closets or in spaces where vertical storage is limited. The hanger could feature telescoping rods or expandable clips that allow users to easily change its height without needing additional hardware. This versatile design can accommodate a wide range of clothing items, including children's clothing, adult clothing, and even bulky items like coats.",
    "**Smart Hanger with Integrated Technology**: Create a clothes hanger that integrates technology, such as built-in LED lights or temperature sensors. The LED lights could help illuminate dark corners of a closet, while the temperature sensor could monitor the humidity level around clothes to prevent damage from moisture. The hanger could connect to a smartphone app, allowing users to remotely control the lights and check the status of their clothes. This innovative hanger would provide convenience and peace of mind for fashion-conscious individuals.",
    "**Interactive Hanger with RFID Technology**: Develop a clothes hanger equipped with Radio Frequency Identification (RFID) technology. Each item of clothing would have an RFID tag attached to it, which would track inventory, prevent theft, and assist in managing the lifecycle of garments. The hanger could communicate with a centralized system, updating the inventory automatically when items are removed or added. This technology would benefit retailers, helping them optimize stock management and provide customers with personalized shopping experiences based on their past purchases and preferences."
