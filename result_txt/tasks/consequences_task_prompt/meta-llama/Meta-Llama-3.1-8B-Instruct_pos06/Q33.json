    "**Ecosystem Overhaul**: If animals grew to twice their size, it would drastically alter the balance of ecosystems worldwide. Large herbivores would consume more resources, leading to a decrease in plant diversity and potentially causing widespread deforestation. This, in turn, would affect the populations of smaller herbivores and carnivores that rely on these plants for food and shelter. The increased competition for resources would lead to a reduction in biodiversity, potentially even causing some species to become extinct. (Confidence score: 0.8)",
    "**Structural Collapse**: Buildings, bridges, and other infrastructure would need to be redesigned or reinforced to accommodate the increased weight and size of animals. This could lead to a significant economic burden on cities and governments, as they would need to invest in infrastructure upgrades. Additionally, the increased weight would put additional stress on the existing infrastructure, potentially leading to structural collapses and accidents. (Confidence score: 0.7)",
    "**Human-Animal Conflict**: With larger animals roaming the streets and countryside, there would be an increased risk of human-animal conflicts. Larger animals would be more aggressive and unpredictable, leading to more frequent attacks on humans. This would require a significant shift in how we interact with and manage wildlife, potentially leading to the development of new technologies and strategies for animal control. (Confidence score: 0.9)",
    "**Evolutionary Adaptations**: As animals grew to twice their size, they would need to adapt to their new environment. This could lead to the evolution of new traits, such as stronger limbs, more efficient respiratory systems, and altered brain structures. This, in turn, could lead to the development of new species that are better suited to their larger size. (Confidence score: 0.6)",
    "**Economic Impact**: The growth of animals to twice their size would have a significant impact on various industries, such as agriculture, forestry, and transportation. The increased size of animals would lead to increased food costs, as farmers would need to produce more food to sustain the larger populations. Additionally, the increased weight and size of animals would lead to increased fuel costs for transportation, as vehicles would need to be redesigned or reinforced to accommodate the heavier loads. (Confidence score: 0.8)"
