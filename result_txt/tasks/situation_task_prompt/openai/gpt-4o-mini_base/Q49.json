    "**DIY Fire Barriers**: Construct simple fire barriers using non-combustible materials. For instance, build a low wall or fence using concrete blocks or bricks around the perimeter of your property. This barrier can help slow down or redirect flames and embers away from your home, providing an extra layer of protection during a fire.",
    "**Water Sprinkler System**: Set up a homemade sprinkler system on your roof and around your property. Using a series of hoses connected to a water source, you can create a misting system that dampens your roof and surrounding areas. This can help prevent embers from igniting flammable materials and keep the immediate vicinity of your home cooler during a fire.",
    "**Fire-Resistant Window Treatments**: Install fire-resistant window films or shades that can reflect heat and prevent flames from entering your home. These materials can be applied to existing windows to enhance their fire resistance, reducing the likelihood of breakage and subsequent fire spread inside.",
    "**Create a Fire Shelter**: Designate a room in your home as a fire shelter, equipped with fire-retardant materials. Use fire-resistant curtains, furniture, and insulation to create a safe space. Stock this room with essential supplies like water, blankets, and a first aid kit, ensuring itâ€™s accessible in case of an emergency.",
    "**Community Fire Watch Program**: Organize a neighborhood watch program focused on fire prevention. Collaborate with neighbors to monitor each other's properties for potential fire hazards. Share knowledge about fire-resistant practices and establish a communication system for alerting each other in case of nearby fires, creating a united front against fire threats."
