    "Smart Lawn Mower: Create a lawn mower that can detect and adapt to the type of grass it is cutting, adjusting its cutting height and speed accordingly. This would result in a more efficient and precise cutting experience, saving time and effort.",
    "Autonomous Lawn Mower: Develop a self-driving lawn mower that can navigate through a property without any human intervention. This would be especially useful for large properties or for people with mobility issues, allowing them to enjoy a well-manicured lawn without the hassle of pushing a mower.",
    "Vertical Lawn Mower: Design a lawn mower that can cut grass on vertical surfaces, such as walls or fences. This would be perfect for people who want to create a lush green wall or to add some greenery to their outdoor space without taking up valuable ground space.",
    "Solar-Powered Lawn Mower: Create a lawn mower that runs on solar power, eliminating the need for gasoline or electricity. This would be a more environmentally friendly option, as well as a cost-effective one, as the sun is free and abundant.",
    "Personalized Lawn Mower: Develop a lawn mower that can adjust its cutting pattern and speed based on the user's preferences. For example, it could be programmed to cut in a spiral pattern for a more even cut, or to adjust its speed based on the user's age or mobility. This would result in a more enjoyable and efficient mowing experience."
