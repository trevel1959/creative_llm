    "**Visual Storytelling**: I would use a combination of gestures, facial expressions, and body language to convey messages. I'd write notes or draw pictures to illustrate my thoughts and emotions. For example, if I wanted to tell someone that I'm excited about a upcoming event, I'd draw a big smiley face and add some colorful doodles around it.",
    "**Tactile Sign Language**: I'd use touch to communicate, relying on physical contact to convey emotions and ideas. I'd use gentle taps on the arm or shoulder to signal attention, and more intense pressure to convey urgency or importance. I'd also use different textures and temperatures to add depth to my messages.",
    "**Light-based Communication**: I'd use light to convey information, relying on flashlights, lanterns, or even glowsticks to create a visual language. I could use different colors, patterns, and intensities to represent various emotions and ideas. For instance, a bright red light could signal excitement or urgency, while a soft blue light could convey calmness or tranquility.",
    "**Rhythm and Music**: I'd use music and rhythm to communicate, relying on melodies, harmonies, and beats to convey emotions and ideas. I could use a combination of instruments or even vocalizations to create a unique language. For example, a fast-paced rhythm could signal excitement or energy, while a slow and soothing melody could convey calmness or relaxation.",
    "**Environmental Storytelling**: I'd use the environment to tell stories and convey messages. I'd use natural objects like leaves, rocks, or flowers to create visual narratives. I could also use the layout of the space to create a physical representation of my ideas. For instance, I might arrange stones in a pattern to represent a specific memory or experience. [/INST] "
