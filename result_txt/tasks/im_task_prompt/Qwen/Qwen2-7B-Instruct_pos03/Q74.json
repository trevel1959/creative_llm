    "**Rainwater Harvesting System**: Design a watering can that collects rainwater for gardening purposes. This can be equipped with a simple funnel or gutter system to collect water from rooftops or any available surface. The collected water can be filtered for purity and stored in the can for use. This idea is eco-friendly as it reduces the need for tap water and conserves water resources.",
    "**Automated Watering Can with Soil Moisture Sensor**: Create a smart watering can that uses soil moisture sensors to determine when plants need water. When the sensor detects that the soil has dried beyond a certain level, the can automatically dispenses water. This ensures that plants receive the precise amount of water they need, reducing overwatering and saving water.",
    "**Compostable Watering Can**: Develop a watering can made from biodegradable materials like bamboo or recycled plastic. These cans could decompose naturally after use, reducing environmental impact. Additionally, the can might have compartments for different types of fertilizers, making it an all-in-one tool for gardeners.",
    "**LED Lighting Watering Can**: Integrate LED lights into the handle or base of the watering can to provide illumination during night-time watering. This helps prevent accidents and makes it easier to see where you're watering, especially in poorly lit gardens. The lights could also double as a decorative element, adding a modern touch to traditional gardening tools.",
    "**Interactive Watering Can with Augmented Reality (AR) Guide**: Design a watering can that comes with a smartphone app. When the user points their phone at the plant, the app provides real-time information about watering needs, sun exposure, pest control, and more. The can itself might have a built-in sensor that communicates directly with the app, adjusting the water output based on the plant's specific requirements. This innovative approach enhances the user experience and provides valuable educational content."
