    "**Pest Infestation**: Gardens are often susceptible to pests like aphids, slugs, and beetles that can damage plants. To combat this, gardeners can implement integrated pest management (IPM) strategies, such as introducing beneficial insects (like ladybugs), using organic pesticides, or creating physical barriers (like row covers) to protect plants from infestations.",
    "**Watering Challenges**: Inconsistent watering can lead to plant stress, either from drought or overwatering. A solution is to install a drip irrigation system that delivers water directly to the roots, ensuring consistent moisture. Additionally, using mulch can help retain soil moisture and reduce evaporation.",
    "**Sunlight Exposure**: Not all areas of a backyard receive equal sunlight, which can affect plant growth. Gardeners should observe their yard throughout the day to identify sunny and shady spots. They can then choose plants suited for their specific light conditions or consider pruning nearby trees or shrubs to enhance sunlight exposure.",
    "**Competing Weeds**: Weeds can quickly overtake a garden, competing with plants for nutrients and water. To prevent this, gardeners can use landscape fabric or mulch to suppress weed growth, regularly check for weeds, and employ manual weeding techniques or organic herbicides to keep them at bay.",
    "**Seasonal Changes**: Weather fluctuations, such as unexpected frost or extreme heat, can damage young plants. Gardeners can mitigate this risk by monitoring weather forecasts and using protective measures, such as frost cloths for cold snaps or shade cloths during heatwaves, to shield plants from adverse conditions."
