    "**Aeroponic Gardening System**: Develop an aeroponic system that suspends plant roots in the air and sprays a nutrient-rich mist onto them. This method eliminates the need for soil and can be more water-efficient. The system could be designed with a series of tubes and nozzles that provide the necessary nutrients and water to the plants.",
    "**Hydroponic Greenhouse**: Create a hydroponic greenhouse that uses a nutrient-rich solution rather than soil to grow plants. The greenhouse could be designed with a network of pipes and pumps that circulate the solution and provide the necessary oxygen and light to the plants.",
    "**Vertical Farming**: Build a vertical farm that uses a series of stacked layers to grow plants. Each layer could be designed to optimize growing conditions, with different plants grown in different layers to maximize space and efficiency.",
    "**Aquaponic System**: Develop an aquaponic system that combines fish farming with plant growth. The waste produced by the fish would be used as fertilizer for the plants, creating a closed-loop system that is both sustainable and efficient.",
    "**Edible Landscape**: Design an edible landscape that incorporates plants into the design of the garden itself. For example, a series of raised beds could be designed to resemble a natural landscape, with plants growing out of the \"hills\" and \"valleys\" to create a visually appealing and functional garden.
