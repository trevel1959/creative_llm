    "**Hydrogen Fuel Cell Networks**: In the absence of oil, hydrogen fuel cells could become a dominant power source for vehicles. Hydrogen can be produced through electrolysis of water using renewable energy sources like wind and solar. Establishing a comprehensive network of hydrogen production facilities and refueling stations would allow vehicles to run on hydrogen, emitting only water vapor as a byproduct. This shift would also encourage advancements in hydrogen storage technology, making it a practical and clean alternative to fossil fuels.",
    "**Magnetic Levitation (Maglev) Transport Systems**: Instead of relying on traditional vehicles, cities could invest in maglev transport systems that use magnetic forces to levitate and propel trains and pods at high speeds. These systems could be integrated into urban environments, providing rapid, efficient public transportation options that eliminate the need for personal vehicles. The energy for these systems could come from renewable sources, making them both eco-friendly and highly efficient.",
    "**Biofuel Innovations**: As oil disappears, the focus would shift to creating advanced biofuels from organic materials, such as algae, agricultural waste, and even food scraps. Researchers could develop genetically modified organisms that produce high-yield biofuels, which could be used in modified internal combustion engines. This would allow existing vehicles to be repurposed while promoting a circular economy where waste is converted into energy.",
    "**Kinetic Energy Harvesting**: Vehicles could be designed to harness kinetic energy from motion. For instance, energy-absorbing systems could be installed in the suspension of cars to capture energy from bumps and turns, converting it into electricity. This energy could then be used to power the vehicleâ€™s electrical systems or recharge batteries. Additionally, roads could be equipped with similar technology to capture energy from passing vehicles, further contributing to a sustainable energy supply.",
    "**Pneumatic Transport Systems**: Cities could develop a network of pneumatic tubes for transporting goods and even people. This system would utilize compressed air to move vehicles through underground or elevated tubes, significantly reducing surface traffic and pollution. The energy to compress the air could be generated through renewable sources, creating a clean and efficient alternative to conventional vehicles."
