    "Smart Laundry System with AI-Powered Sorting: Develop a smart laundry system that uses AI-powered sorting to categorize clothes based on fabric type, color, and soil level. This system would use computer vision and machine learning algorithms to identify the type of fabric, color, and soil level of each item. The system would then sort the clothes into different bins, ensuring that delicate items are washed separately from heavily soiled clothes. This system would reduce the risk of damage to clothes and make laundry day more efficient.",
    "Eco-Friendly Laundry Detergent: Create an eco-friendly laundry detergent that is biodegradable, non-toxic, and free from harsh chemicals. This detergent would use natural ingredients such as plant-based surfactants, essential oils, and natural enzymes to clean clothes effectively. The packaging would be made from recyclable materials, and the detergent would be sold in refillable containers to reduce waste.",
    "Laundry-Folding Robot: Design a laundry-folding robot that can fold clothes with precision and speed. The robot would use computer vision and machine learning algorithms to identify the type of fabric and fold it accordingly. The robot would be able to fold clothes such as t-shirts, pants, and towels with ease, saving time and effort for the user.",
    "Virtual Try-On for Clothes: Develop a virtual try-on feature for clothes that allows users to try on clothes virtually before purchasing them. This feature would use augmented reality (AR) technology to superimpose a virtual version of the clothes on the user's body. The user would be able to see how the clothes fit, look, and move, reducing the need for returns and exchanges.",
    "Laundry-Friendly Clothing Design: Collaborate with clothing designers to create clothes that are laundry-friendly, meaning they are designed to be easy to wash, dry, and fold. This would involve using fabrics that are resistant to wrinkles, shrinkage, and color bleeding. The clothes would also be designed with features such as easy-to-use zippers, snap buttons, and adjustable cuffs to make laundry day easier. The goal is to reduce the time and effort spent on laundry and make it more enjoyable."
