    "Renewable Energy Revolution: If the world were to run out of oil, there would be a sudden and urgent need to transition to alternative sources of energy. This could lead to a renewable energy revolution, where solar, wind, hydro, and geothermal power become the primary sources of energy. This would not only reduce our reliance on oil but also help combat climate change by reducing greenhouse gas emissions.",
    "Transportation Evolution: The shortage of oil would force a shift away from fossil fuels and towards electric or hydrogen-powered vehicles. This would lead to a significant reduction in air pollution and greenhouse gas emissions, making cities cleaner and healthier to live in. Additionally, the development of new transportation technologies, such as advanced battery technology and magnetic levitation trains, could make transportation faster, more efficient, and more environmentally friendly.",
    "Circular Economy: As oil becomes scarce, the world would need to adopt a circular economy model, where resources are used more efficiently and waste is minimized. This would involve designing products and processes that are restorative and regenerative by nature, reducing the amount of waste generated and the amount of energy needed to produce new products. This would lead to a more sustainable and resilient economy.",
    "Increased Investment in Space Exploration: As oil becomes scarce, countries may turn to space exploration as a new source of energy. This could involve establishing colonies on the moon or other planets, where resources such as helium-3 (a rare isotope that could be used as a fuel source) are abundant. This would provide a new source of energy and help reduce our reliance on Earth's finite resources.",
    "Urban Farming and Vertical Agriculture: With the scarcity of oil, cities may need to become more self-sufficient in terms of food production. This could involve the development of urban farming and vertical agriculture, where crops are grown in vertically stacked layers in indoor environments. This would reduce the need for long-distance transportation and help ensure a stable food supply, even in the face of an oil shortage."
