    "**Integrated Smart Technology**: Incorporate smart technology into the coat rack, such as built-in sensors that can detect when someone enters the room. It could trigger a soft LED light to illuminate the area, making it easier to find and hang coats in dimly lit spaces. Additionally, it could be connected to a smartphone app to send reminders to take your coat or umbrella if rain is forecasted.",
    "**Sustainable Materials and Design**: Design a coat rack using sustainable materials like bamboo or recycled plastics. The aesthetic could be enhanced with a minimalist design that emphasizes natural textures and colors. This would appeal to eco-conscious consumers while promoting sustainability in home decor.",
    "**Multi-Functional Base with Storage**: Transform the base of the coat rack into a functional storage unit. This could include drawers or compartments for shoes, gloves, and other accessories, keeping the entryway tidy. The top could also serve as a small shelf for decorative items or everyday essentials like keys and wallets.",
    "**Wall-Mounted Foldable Hooks**: Design a wall-mounted coat rack with foldable hooks that can be tucked away when not in use. This would be particularly useful for small spaces, allowing the rack to maintain a sleek appearance while providing the functionality of a coat rack when needed. Users could choose how many hooks to deploy based on their current needs.",
    "**Artistic Sculptural Rack**: Create a coat rack that doubles as a piece of art. This could involve designing the rack in the shape of a tree, abstract sculpture, or other artistic forms that blend functionality with aesthetics. This approach would make the coat rack a conversation piece and enhance the overall decor of the space."
