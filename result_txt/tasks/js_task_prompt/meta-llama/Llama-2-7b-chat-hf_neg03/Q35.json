    "Woolly Mammoth - I would choose to bring back the Woolly Mammoth because they were incredibly intelligent and social creatures. They were known to have lived in herds and had a complex communication system, which would be fascinating to study. Additionally, they were herbivores, which means they would not pose a threat to human populations for food or resources.",
    "Quagga - I would choose to bring back the Quagga, a subspecies of zebra that was once found in large numbers in South Africa. The Quagga was unique in that it had a distinctive striping pattern, with only the front half of its body having stripes. By bringing back the Quagga, we could learn more about the evolution of striped patterns in animals and how they help them blend in with their surroundings.",
    "Passenger Pigeon - The Passenger Pigeon was once one of the most abundant bird species in North America, with an estimated population of 3 billion to 5 billion individuals. However, due to overhunting and habitat loss, the species went extinct in 1914. By bringing back the Passenger Pigeon, we could learn more about the impact of human activities on ecosystems and the importance of conservation efforts.",
    "Thylacine - The Thylacine, also known as the Tasmanian Tiger, was a carnivorous marsupial that was native to Australia and Tasmania. It is believed that the Thylacine went extinct around 1936 due to hunting and disease. By bringing back the Thylacine, we could learn more about the evolution of mammalian carnivores and how they adapted to different environments.",
    "Moa - The Moa was a large, flightless bird that was native to New Zealand. There were several species of Moa, ranging in size from 2 to 4 meters tall. By bringing back the Moa, we could learn more about the evolution of flightless birds and how they adapted to their environments. Additionally, the Moa would provide a unique opportunity for scientists to study the effects of island gigantism, where large animals evolve to take advantage of the limited resources available on islands."
