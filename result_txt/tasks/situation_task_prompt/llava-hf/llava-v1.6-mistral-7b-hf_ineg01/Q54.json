    "Hydrofoil Ferries: Develop hydrofoil ferries that use underwater hydrofoils to lift the vessel out of the water and travel at high speeds. This would allow for faster travel across large bodies of water, reducing travel time.",
    "Submarine Tugboats: Use submarine-like tugboats to tow larger vessels or barges across the water. These could be powered by nuclear or electric engines and could travel at high speeds while towing larger vessels.",
    "Floating Solar Platforms: Build floating solar platforms that use solar panels to generate electricity for propulsion. These platforms could also be equipped with living quarters, making them self-sustaining and capable of long-distance travel.",
    "Water-based Trains: Develop water-based trains that use underwater tracks and propulsion systems to travel across large bodies of water. These trains could be powered by electric engines and could carry a large number of passengers or cargo.",
    "Maglev Trains: Use magnetic levitation technology to create trains that travel on a magnetic track above the water's surface. This would allow for high-speed travel across large bodies of water, with minimal friction and energy loss."
