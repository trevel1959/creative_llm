    "**Eco-Friendly Material and Design**:    Redesign the hair dryer using sustainable materials, such as biodegradable plastics or recycled aluminum. Incorporate energy-efficient technology that reduces power consumption without sacrificing performance. Additionally, create a modular design that allows users to replace specific parts (like the motor or heating element) instead of discarding the entire unit, promoting longevity and reducing waste.",
    "**Self-Cleaning Mechanism**:    Implement a self-cleaning feature that uses a combination of heat and airflow to eliminate dust and hair build-up in the dryerâ€™s internal components. This would not only enhance performance but also prolong the lifespan of the device. Users could activate the cleaning cycle with the press of a button after every few uses, ensuring their hair dryer remains hygienic and efficient.",
    "**Multi-Functional Attachment System**:    Develop a range of interchangeable attachments that serve multiple functions beyond drying hair. For example, a diffuser attachment that also acts as a styling tool, a volumizing comb, or a curling wand. This would allow users to achieve various hairstyles with one device, minimizing the need for multiple styling tools and saving space.",
    "**Noise Reduction Technology**:    Incorporate advanced sound-dampening technology to significantly reduce the noise produced by the hair dryer. This could be achieved through specialized materials in the casing and improved motor design. The result would be a quieter drying experience, making it more enjoyable for users, especially in shared living spaces or during early mornings.",
    "**Portable and Foldable Design**:    Create a compact, foldable hair dryer that is lightweight and travel-friendly. It could feature a retractable cord and a built-in power bank to charge devices on the go. This design would appeal to frequent travelers who need a reliable styling tool without taking up too much luggage space, ensuring they can maintain their hair routine wherever they are."
