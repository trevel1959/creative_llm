    "Extreme life extension: With the ability to change their biological age, humans would be able to live much longer and healthier lives than ever before. This would allow individuals to pursue their passions and achieve lifelong goals, and also provide an opportunity to help solve global challenges like poverty and climate change.",
    "Utopian society: If humans could change their biological age, it could lead to the creation of a utopian society where no one dies prematurely from age-related illnesses. This would bring the world closer to achieving peace and harmony.",
    "Population explosion: This ability would lead to a population explosion, resulting in overpopulation and the exhaustion of resources. Societies would need to develop strict governance to prevent abuse of this power and ensure sustainable living.",
    "Social and economic disruptions: The ability to change biological age would disrupt existing social and economic structures, as the traditional retirement age would become irrelevant, and jobs would need to be redefined to accommodate older workers.",
    "Ethical concerns: The ability to change biological age raises important ethical questions. Would individuals have the right to modify their genes or could this lead to unfair advantages in society? Would society be able to support the increased demand for resources as the population ages?"
