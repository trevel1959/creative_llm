    "Ink-redible Time Management: Design a pen that can change colors based on the task you're working on. For example, you can have a blue pen for creative tasks, a red pen for urgent ones, and a green pen for tasks that are long overdue. This will help you stay organized and focused.",
    "Write Your Way to Success: Create a pen that can write in different fonts and styles, depending on the mood you're in.

    "The Pen-itive: Create a pen that can detect when you're feeling guilty or regretful about not starting a task earlier. When you start writing, the pen will vibrate or make a noise to remind you to get back on track. This will help you stay motivated and avoid procrastination."
