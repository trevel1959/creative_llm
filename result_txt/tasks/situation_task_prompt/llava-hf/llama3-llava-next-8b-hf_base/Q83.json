    "**Alternative sleep time** : Since sleep cannot be completely ruled out, we might transition to new sleep times. People might start sleeping during their natural circadian peak, which typically occurs in the early dawn. This would shift our routine, but it could also provide a unique energy boost during the day as we feel the natural energy rush of the sun.",
    "**Alternative dark environments** : In the absence of night, we would need an alternative form of darkness or artificial environments that can provide a suitable sleep area. This could include specially designed darkened tents, domed shelters, or even specially made sleep pods with adjustable lighting.",
    "**Temperature Regulation**: During the day, temperatures would likely rise, reaching heat waves. To counter this, people might use specialized sleep pods with built-in cooling systems, air conditioning, and ventilation for comfortable sleep. On the flip side, during colder months, people might use heated sleep areas, blankets, or bed covers to stay warm.",
    "**Sleeping in layers**: In the absence of night, we would need new ways to signal to our bodies when it's time to sleep. People could use different environmental cues, such as scented pads under the mattress, temperature changes, or even vibration feedback.",
    "**Natural light sleepers**: Some individuals may develop the ability to sleep in extremely bright conditions. Sleeping in brightly lit environments could be their preferred choice, as their circadian rhythms would be better aligned with the constant exposure to sunlight."
