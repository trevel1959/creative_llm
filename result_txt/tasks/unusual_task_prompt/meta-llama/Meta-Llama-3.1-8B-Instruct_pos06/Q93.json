    "**Ephemeral Vase**: Design a vase that is made from a living, breathing organism, such as a fungus or a plant. The vase would grow and change shape over time, creating a unique and dynamic piece of art. The idea is to challenge traditional notions of what a vase should be and to create a piece that is both beautiful and ephemeral.",
    "**Memory Keeper Vase**: Create a vase that is embedded with a small, intricate mechanism that allows it to store and release scents. The vase would be designed to hold a specific memory or emotion, and when someone approaches it, the scent would be released, transporting them back to a particular moment in time. This vase would be a poignant reminder of the power of scent to evoke emotions and memories.",
    "**Gravity-Defying Vase**: Design a vase that appears to defy gravity, floating in mid-air or seemingly suspended from a thin thread. The vase would be made from a lightweight, transparent material and would be equipped with a hidden mechanism that creates the illusion of weightlessness. This vase would be a thought-provoking commentary on the nature of reality and perception.",
    "**Vase as a Time Capsule**: Create a vase that doubles as a time capsule, allowing users to store small mementos and messages for future generations. The vase would be designed with a hidden compartment that can be sealed and dated, creating a unique and intimate connection between past and present.",
    "**Interactive Vase**: Design a vase that responds to sound, light, or movement, creating a dynamic and immersive experience for the user. The vase could change color, shape, or pattern in response to external stimuli, making it a interactive and engaging piece of art."
