    "**Eco-Friendly Biodegradable Toothbrush**: Develop a toothbrush made entirely from biodegradable materials, such as bamboo and plant-based plastics. This toothbrush could decompose within a year after disposal, reducing plastic waste. Additionally, it could come with a seed embedded in the handle, allowing users to plant it after use, growing a tree or plant as a sustainable alternative.",
    "**Toothbrush with UV Sanitization**: Incorporate a UV-C light into the toothbrush design that activates automatically when the toothbrush is placed back in its holder. This feature would help kill bacteria and viruses that accumulate on the bristles between uses, ensuring a cleaner brushing experience and promoting better oral health.",
    "**Multi-Functional Toothbrush**: Design a toothbrush that features interchangeable heads for various functions. For instance, one head could be for standard brushing, another for gum massaging, and a third for tongue scraping. This versatility would encourage users to maintain a comprehensive oral hygiene routine with one device.",
    "**Color-Changing Bristles**: Create a toothbrush with bristles that change color based on the pH level of the user's mouth. This would serve as a visual indicator of oral health; for example, if the bristles turn a certain color, it could suggest that it's time to see a dentist or that the user should focus on certain areas during brushing.",
    "**Interactive Brushing Timer**: Develop a toothbrush that includes a built-in timer with a fun, interactive display. The timer could feature engaging animations or sounds that guide users through the recommended two-minute brushing session, making the process enjoyable for children and adults alike, and encouraging them to brush for the full duration."
