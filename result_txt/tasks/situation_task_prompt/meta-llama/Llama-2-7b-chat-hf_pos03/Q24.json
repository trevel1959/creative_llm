    "Artificial Corneas: One creative solution to help people with poor vision cope without glasses or contact lenses would be the development of artificial corneas. These corneas would be made of a biocompatible material, such as a synthetic polymer, and would be designed to mimic the structure and function of a natural cornea. They would be inserted into the eye through a minimally invasive surgical procedure and would provide a clear, distortion-free vision.",
    "Bionic Eye Implants: Another option would be the development of bionic eye implants. These implants would be equipped with a camera and a microchip that would convert light into electrical signals, which would then be transmitted to the brain through electrodes. This would allow people with poor vision to \"see\" in a way, as the brain would interpret the signals as visual information.",
    "Brain-Computer Interfaces: Brain-computer interfaces (BCIs) are a promising technology that could help people with poor vision communicate and interact with their environment. BCIs work by detecting brain signals and translating them into commands that can control electronic devices. For people with poor vision, BCIs could be used to control a computer or smartphone, allowing them to access information and communicate with others in a more independent manner.",
    "Smart Contact Lenses: Smart contact lenses are a creative solution that could help people with poor vision navigate their environment. These lenses would be equipped with a small display screen and a tiny camera, allowing the wearer to see virtual information, such as street names, directions, and messages, superimposed onto their real-world view.",
    "Virtual Reality Glasses: Virtual reality (VR) glasses could also be used to help people with poor vision \"see\" more clearly. VR glasses would provide a fully immersive visual experience, allowing the wearer to see a virtual world that is tailored to their specific needs. For example, the virtual world could be adjusted to enhance contrast, brightness, or color perception, depending on the individual's specific vision challenges."
