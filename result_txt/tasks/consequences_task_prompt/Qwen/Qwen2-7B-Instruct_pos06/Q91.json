    "**Artistic Gravity Sculptures**: In an inverted world, artists could create stunning gravity-defying sculptures. The sculptures would hang upside down, defying the usual laws of physics. For example, a pendulum sculpture would look like it's floating upwards instead of swinging downwards. Confidence Score: 0.9",
    "**Inverted Sports Games**: Sports like basketball, soccer, and tennis would need complete reimagining. Instead of aiming for a hoop or net below, athletes would have to aim upwards. Players would need to develop new skills, such as high jumping or long throwing, to reach the inverted targets. Confidence Score: 0.85",
    "**Reversed Gravity Transportation**: In a reversed gravity scenario, vehicles and transportation systems would have to be designed differently. Cars and buses could drive upwards on roads that are inverted. Lifts would operate by pulling people upwards rather than pushing them downwards. Confidence Score: 0.9",
    "**New Architecture Designs**: Architects would have to rethink the way buildings are constructed and designed. Tall structures would have their foundations at the top, and floors would be laid upwards. Skyscrapers could feature open-air parks and gardens on the 'top floor' where people can enjoy the view from above. Confidence Score: 0.9",
    "**Gravity-based Entertainment**: Entertainment industries could see a surge in new attractions based on the theme of inverted gravity. Amusement parks could feature rides where you fall upwards, roller coasters that climb mountains instead of descending them, and perhaps even a new form of zero-gravity sports like inverted bungee jumping or skydiving. Confidence Score: 0.88"
