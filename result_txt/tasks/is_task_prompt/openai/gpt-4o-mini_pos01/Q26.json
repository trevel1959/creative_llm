Every evening, as the sun dipped below the horizon, it would whisper tales of lost love and forgotten dreams to anyone who would listen. Young Elara, a curious girl, often sat by the ancient oak tree, straining to catch the wind's soft murmurs. One night, it spoke of a hidden treasure buried beneath the roots of the tree.
