    "Use the moon and stars as natural light sources: If all lamps and lighting fixtures were to disappear, one creative solution would be to utilize the natural light sources available in the environment. By positioning windows strategically in a room, you could harness the soft, gentle glow of the moon and stars to illuminate the space.
