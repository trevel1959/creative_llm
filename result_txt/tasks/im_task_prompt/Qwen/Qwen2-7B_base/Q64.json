    "Voice-Activated Alarm System: This innovative idea allows the user to control their alarm system using voice commands instead of traditional buttons. For instance, users can simply say, \"Hey, wake up,\" and the alarm will go off. In addition, the system can also serve as a voice assistant, helping the user set alarms and manage their daily routine.",
    "Personalized Alarm Tone Generator: This feature would allow users to create custom alarm melodies by selecting their favorite songs or specific sounds. By incorporating this feature, the alarm system can generate unique, personalized music tones to wake the user up gradually, enhancing their overall experience.",
    "Emergency Alert Integration: Consider integrating an emergency alert feature into the alarm system, which can send notifications to both the homeowner and the authorities (e.g., police, fire department) in case of an emergency, including break-ins, fires, carbon monoxide leaks, or other safety threats.",
    "Smart Bed Frame Compatibility: The alarm system can be compatible with adjustable or smart bed frames, allowing the bed to rise smoothly and gently with the alarm. This would be an excellent way to help those who prefer a more gentle awaking and avoid the shock of jumping out of bed.",
    "Energy Efficiency Feature: Implement energy-saving measures by designing the alarm system to detect occupancy in a room. The alarm is set to conserve energy by turning off the devices that are not being used when someone is no longer present in the room."
