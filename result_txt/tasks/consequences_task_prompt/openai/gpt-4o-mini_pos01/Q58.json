    "**Solar Desalination Plants**: With abundant solar energy, we could develop large-scale desalination plants that use solar power to convert seawater into fresh drinking water. This technology would help combat water scarcity in arid regions, providing clean water for drinking, agriculture, and sanitation. The integration of solar energy would make these plants sustainable and reduce their environmental impact, leading to a new era of water security. Confidence score: 0.80",
    "**Global Solar Grid**: A worldwide network of solar farms connected by a global grid could allow countries to share solar energy. Countries in sunny regions could produce excess energy during peak sunlight hours and transmit it to regions with less sunlight. This interconnected grid would enhance energy security and stability, reduce dependence on fossil fuels, and foster international cooperation in energy management. Confidence score: 0.75",
    "**Solar-Powered Space Exploration**: Harnessing the full power of the sun could revolutionize space exploration. Solar sails, utilizing solar radiation pressure, could propel spacecraft beyond our solar system, allowing for faster travel to distant planets and even other star systems. This technology would enable more ambitious missions, such as sending probes to explore the outer reaches of our solar system or even human missions to Mars powered by solar energy. Confidence score: 0.70",
    "**Solar-Powered Agriculture**: Utilizing solar energy to power agricultural operations could lead to the development of solar farms integrated with vertical farming systems. These farms would use advanced hydroponics and aeroponics, powered entirely by solar energy, to produce food in urban areas. This approach would reduce transportation emissions, increase food security, and create jobs in sustainable agriculture. Confidence score: 0.80",
    "**Solar Energy Storage Revolution**: The full harnessing of solar energy would drive innovation in energy storage technologies. New breakthroughs in battery technology, such as solid-state batteries or advanced supercapacitors, could store vast amounts of solar energy for use during nighttime or cloudy days. This would ensure a constant and reliable energy supply, making solar energy a primary energy source across the globe. Confidence score: 0.75"
