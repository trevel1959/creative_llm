    "**Digital Luggage Tag with QR Code**: Replace the standard paper tags with a digital display that shows a QR code. When scanned, the QR code would provide all necessary travel information, such as the owner's contact details, flight information, and destination. This could help airline staff and other travelers identify lost luggage quickly.",
    "**Interactive Luggage Tag with NFC Technology**: Incorporate NFC (Near Field Communication) technology into the luggage tag. This would allow travelers to tap their smartphones on the tag to receive important information, such as flight updates, gate changes, or even local tips about their destination, enhancing the travel experience.",
    "**Personalized Luggage Tag with Custom Designs**: Create a platform where travelers can design their own luggage tags using photos, colors, and text. This personalization not only helps in easy identification of luggage but also adds a fun and creative element to travel. Users could even choose materials that reflect their style, such as leather, fabric, or eco-friendly options.",
    "**Luggage Tag with Built-in Weight Sensor**: Develop a luggage tag that includes a weight sensor, allowing travelers to weigh their luggage by simply lifting it. The tag could sync with a smartphone app to alert users if their bag exceeds airline weight limits, helping avoid extra fees and making packing more efficient.",
    "**Luggage Tag with Emergency Contact Features**: Design a tag that includes a dedicated button or feature for emergencies. If the traveler gets into a situation where they need assistance, they could press the button, which would then send a pre-set message with their location to a designated emergency contact. This would provide an added layer of safety while traveling."
