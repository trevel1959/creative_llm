    "Sunlight Alarm: Another idea is to use sunlight as a natural alarm clock. By placing a small sensor on the bedroom window, the device could track the amount of sunlight entering the room and automatically turn on a light at a predetermined time, simulating the sunrise and gradually increasing in brightness.",
    "Movement-Based Alarm: A person could use a smartwatch or a fitness tracker to monitor their sleep patterns and track their movement during the night. The device could then set an alarm based on the person's typical sleep duration and the time they usually wake up. When the person reaches a certain level of movement, the alarm would activate, signaling it's time to wake up.",
    "Plant-Based Alarm: Incorporating plants in the bedroom can be another way to create a natural alarm clock. Some plants, like the African Violet, bloom at specific times and release a fragrance. By placing a plant in the bedroom, the person could set the plant to bloom at their desired wake-up time, and the fragrance would serve as a gentle reminder to wake up.",
    "Melodic Alarm: A person could use a musical instrument, such as a guitar or a piano, to create a melody that they enjoy waking up to. By setting a timer on the instrument, the person could have the melody play at their desired wake-up time, providing a pleasant and soothing way to start the day.",
    "Aroma Alarm: An essential oil diffuser could be set to release a specific scent at a set time. By choosing a scent that is energizing and uplifting, like citrus or peppermint, the person could have a pleasant aroma fill the room, serving as a natural alarm clock that wakes them up without the need for sound."
