    "Once upon a time, in a shimmering pond, lived a small frog named Ferdinand. He gazed at the grand castle across the water, dreaming of being a prince. One evening, a kind-hearted fairy appeared and granted him a wish. With a flash of magic, Ferdinand transformed into a handsome prince. Excited, he rushed to the castle, but soon realized he missed his carefree life in the pond. The luxury felt hollow without his froggy friends. One day, he returned to the pond, wishing to be a frog again. The fairy smiled, granting his wish, and Ferdinand croaked happily among his friends once more.",
