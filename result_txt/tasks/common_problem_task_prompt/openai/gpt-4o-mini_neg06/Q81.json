    "**Film Selection Challenges**: Curating a diverse and engaging lineup of films can be daunting. There may be disagreements among the selection committee about which films to include, and some films may not meet the festival's thematic goals. To mitigate this, organizers could host a public voting process where community members can suggest and vote on films they would like to see. This approach not only increases audience engagement but also helps ensure that the lineup reflects the interests of the local community.",
    "**Logistical Issues with Venues**: Finding and securing the right venues for screenings can be complicated. Issues such as capacity, accessibility, technical requirements, and scheduling conflicts may arise. To overcome this, organizers should create a comprehensive venue database that includes detailed information about each location's capabilities. Additionally, having backup venues in mind can provide flexibility in case of unforeseen issues with the primary venue.",
    "**Marketing and Audience Engagement**: Attracting attendees to the festival can be challenging, especially if it's a new event. Organizers may struggle with effectively marketing the festival to the right audience. To tackle this, they could utilize social media campaigns, influencer partnerships, and local community outreach programs to generate buzz. Collaborating with local schools, universities, and film clubs can also help target specific demographics and encourage participation.",
    "**Technical Failures**: During screenings, technical issues such as projector malfunctions, sound problems, or software glitches can occur, leading to a poor audience experience. To prevent this, organizers should conduct thorough technical rehearsals before the festival and have a dedicated technical team on standby during screenings. Investing in reliable equipment and having backup solutions in place (like alternative screening methods) can also minimize disruptions.",
    "**Networking and Collaboration Opportunities**: Festivals often aim to foster connections among filmmakers, industry professionals, and audiences. However, creating effective networking opportunities can be difficult. To enhance networking, organizers could incorporate structured networking events, such as speed-dating style meet-and-greets, panel discussions, and workshops. This would encourage meaningful interactions and collaborations, making the festival more valuable for attendees."
