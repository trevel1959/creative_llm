    "**Navigation and Orientation**: Without a map or compass, it can be challenging to navigate the island, especially if it’s dense with foliage. Getting lost can lead to wasting energy and time, making survival more difficult. Creating a simple map based on visible landmarks, or using the sun and stars for navigation, can help maintain a sense of direction. Additionally, marking trails can prevent getting lost during foraging or exploring.",
    "**Health Risks from Wildlife**: A deserted island may be home to various wildlife, some of which could pose health risks. This includes poisonous plants, venomous snakes, or aggressive animals. Understanding basic survival knowledge about local fauna is crucial. Developing skills to identify dangerous species and learning to avoid them, as well as building a shelter that can protect against wildlife threats, are important steps to ensure safety.",
    "**Mental Health Challenges**: The psychological impact of isolation can lead to feelings of despair, anxiety, or depression. The stress of survival combined with loneliness can severely affect mental health. To combat this, establishing a daily routine can provide structure. Engaging in activities such as journaling, crafting, or meditation can also help maintain a positive mindset and emotional well-being.",
    "**Exposure to the Elements**: Weather conditions on a deserted island can be unpredictable, with potential exposure to extreme heat, cold, rain, or storms. This can lead to hypothermia or heat exhaustion. Building a sturdy shelter that provides protection from the elements is essential. Additionally, creating insulation with natural materials like leaves or using rocks to shield against wind can help maintain a stable temperature.",
    "**Lack of Communication**: Being cut off from the outside world can lead to feelings of helplessness. Without means to communicate, there’s no way to call for help or signal for rescue. Creating large SOS signals using rocks or logs on the beach can attract the attention of passing ships or aircraft. Additionally, if there are any flares or signal mirrors available, they should be utilized to increase visibility."
