    "**Eco-Friendly Wedding Venue**: Choose a venue that aligns with sustainable practices. For example, a botanical garden or a farm where the couple can marry amidst nature. The venue should ideally use renewable energy sources like solar panels for lighting and power. They could also implement recycling programs, composting for food waste, and use biodegradable or reusable items for decorations.",
    "**Sustainable Invitations and Wedding Favors**: Use digital invitations instead of paper ones to save trees. Opt for invitations made from recycled paper or plantable paper, which can be planted after use to grow wildflowers. For favors, consider small potted plants, homemade jams, or locally sourced honey in reusable glass jars, which can be enjoyed by guests and repurposed later.",
    "**Seasonal and Local Food Menu**: Serve a menu featuring local and seasonal produce, reducing the carbon footprint associated with transporting food. Partner with local farmers and caterers who can provide organic, sustainably grown ingredients. Include vegetarian or vegan options as they often require less water and resources to produce than meat.",
    "**Eco-Friendly Transportation**: Encourage guests to use public transportation, carpool, or cycle to the venue. Arrange for bike racks and electric vehicle charging stations if possible. Provide shuttle services using hybrid or electric vehicles to transport guests between locations if needed.",
    "**Zero-Waste Wedding**: Implement a comprehensive plan to minimize waste on the day. Use biodegradable tableware, serve dishes family-style to reduce packaging, and ensure there are plenty of recycling bins. At the end of the event, donate any leftover food to local shelters or charities. Encourage guests to take home floral arrangements or small decor items instead of disposable favors."
