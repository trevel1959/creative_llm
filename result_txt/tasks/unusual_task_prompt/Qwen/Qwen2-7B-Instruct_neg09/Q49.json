    "**Eco-Friendly Frame Making Workshop**: Create a workshop where participants can learn to make their own picture frames using sustainable materials like reclaimed wood, bamboo, or even recycled paper. This not only encourages creativity but also promotes environmental consciousness. The workshop could include instructions on how to properly source these materials, how to cut and shape them, and how to apply natural finishes like linseed oil or beeswax. Participants could take home their custom-made frames, ready to be used for personal photos or as gifts.",
    "**Time Capsule Frames**: Design picture frames that can double as time capsules. These frames would have a slot in the back where a small note or photo can be placed. Encourage people to write down their thoughts, dreams, or memories alongside their pictures. This idea is perfect for birthdays, weddings, or any significant event. Over the years, opening these frames can serve as a nostalgic journey through time, providing a unique way to preserve memories.",
    "**Interactive Storytelling Frames**: Create digital picture frames that allow users to embed interactive elements into their photos. For example, by scanning a QR code next to each picture, viewers can access additional information, videos, or sound clips related to the photo. This technology could be integrated into a website or app, allowing anyone with a smartphone to engage with the content. Itâ€™s a modern twist on traditional photo displays, enhancing storytelling and making memories more immersive.",
    "**DIY Paint-Your-Own Frames**: Offer customizable picture frames that customers can paint themselves at home. Provide a variety of colors and styles to choose from, along with brushes and paints. Include a guide on how to properly prepare the frame before painting, ensuring the best results. This activity not only allows for artistic expression but also adds a personal touch to the finished product. Customers can then seal their creations with a clear coat to protect the paint and maintain its vibrancy.",
    "**Vintage Revival Frames**: Design a series of picture frames inspired by different eras, such as Victorian, Art Deco, or Retro styles. Each frame should come with a brief history of the design era, explaining its significance and key characteristics. This educational aspect makes it an engaging project for both adults and children. People can then choose a frame that matches their personal style or the theme of their photos, transforming ordinary pictures into works of art with a touch of history."
