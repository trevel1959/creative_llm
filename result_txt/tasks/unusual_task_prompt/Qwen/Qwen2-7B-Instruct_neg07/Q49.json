    "**Interactive Time Capsule**: Create a picture frame that doubles as a time capsule. The idea is to encourage people to place photographs, personal letters, or messages inside the frame. Over the years, they can open it on a specific date (like their birthday or a significant anniversary) to relive memories and reflect on their journey. This frame can be designed with a mechanism to lock securely until the designated date.",
    "**Customizable Picture Frame with Light Effects**: Develop a picture frame that changes its color or brightness based on the time of day or the user's mood. This frame could be programmed to adapt to different lighting conditions or use sensors to detect the user's emotional state. For example, during sunset, it might turn warm and golden, creating a calming effect.",
    "**Eco-Friendly Picture Frame with Solar Power**: Design a picture frame powered by solar energy. The frame itself could be made from eco-friendly materials like bamboo or reclaimed wood. It would have solar panels on the back that charge an internal battery, which powers the display. This not only reduces the environmental impact but also makes the frame sustainable and low-maintenance.",
    "**3D Printing for Custom Art Pieces**: Offer a service where customers can upload digital designs or 3D models, and you print them onto custom picture frames. This allows for the creation of unique, personalized art pieces that can be displayed in homes or offices. Users can choose from various frame styles, colors, and even materials to match their decor.",
    "**Interactive Digital Picture Frame**: Create a digital picture frame that allows users to interact with their photos through touch or voice commands. This could include features like playing slideshow transitions, zooming into specific parts of the photo, or adding captions or comments directly on the frame. It could also sync with social media accounts, allowing friends and family to remotely add or comment on shared photos."
