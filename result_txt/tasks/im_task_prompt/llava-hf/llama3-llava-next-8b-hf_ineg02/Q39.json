    "Self-Draining Garden Hose: Add a built-in drainage system to the hose that allows water to drain back into the source when not in use, preventing water from pooling around the hose.",
    "Multi-Function Garden Hose: Develop a hose with interchangeable attachments for various gardening tasks, such as watering, pruning, and soil testing. This would reduce the need for multiple hoses and attachments.",
    "Extendable Garden Hose: Create a hose with a retractable or extendable feature, allowing users to adjust the length of the hose based on the distance they need to cover. This would save storage space and make it easier to transport the hose.",
    "Pressure Regulating Garden Hose: Design a hose with a built-in pressure regulator that adjusts water pressure to prevent damage to delicate plants and reduces water spray from being too forceful.",
    "Solar-Powered Garden Hose: Develop a hose that harnesses solar energy to power a pump, eliminating the need for electric connections and reducing energy consumption."
