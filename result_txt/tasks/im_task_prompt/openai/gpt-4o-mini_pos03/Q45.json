    "**Color-Changing LED Light Strips**: Enhance the aesthetic appeal of ceiling fans by incorporating color-changing LED light strips around the fan blades or base. Users could customize the lighting to match their mood or decor using a remote control or a smartphone app. This feature could include preset themes for parties, relaxation, or even seasonal changes, making the fan a versatile lighting source as well.",
    "**Self-Cleaning Fan Blades**: Develop a ceiling fan with a self-cleaning mechanism for its blades. Using a combination of ultrasonic technology and special coatings, the fan could vibrate at specific frequencies to dislodge dust and debris. This would not only reduce the need for manual cleaning but also improve air quality by preventing dust from being circulated back into the room.",
    "**Adjustable Blade Pitch for Seasonal Use**: Design a ceiling fan with adjustable blade pitch that can be easily modified for different seasons. In the summer, blades can be set to a steeper angle to create a cooling breeze, while in the winter, they can be adjusted to a flatter angle to circulate warm air that collects near the ceiling. This feature could be automated based on the thermostat settings or controlled via an app.",
    "**Integrated Aromatherapy Diffuser**: Transform the ceiling fan into a multi-functional device by adding an integrated aromatherapy diffuser. Users could add essential oils to a reservoir, and as the fan operates, it would gently disperse the scents throughout the room. This feature would promote relaxation and well-being, making the fan not just a cooling device but also a source of soothing fragrances.",
    "**Eco-Friendly Energy Generation**: Innovate a ceiling fan that incorporates small solar panels on its blades or housing. These panels could harness sunlight during the day to power the fan, significantly reducing electricity usage. Additionally, the fan could store excess energy in a battery system to operate at night or during cloudy days, making it a sustainable option for eco-conscious consumers."
