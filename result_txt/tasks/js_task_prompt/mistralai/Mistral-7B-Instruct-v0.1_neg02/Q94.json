    "The new energy source would be called \"Euphoric Energy\" and it would be generated through a combination of positive emotions and thoughts. The process would involve harnessing the power of positive energy and channeling it into a usable form. It would require a device that can detect and measure positive energy levels in a person or a group of people. Once the energy is detected, it can be transformed into electricity and used to power devices and machines.",
    "The new energy source would be called \"Solar Energy 2.0\" and it would be generated through a new type of solar panel that can capture energy from the sun's ultraviolet rays. This new technology would allow for the generation of energy even on cloudy days or during the winter months. The panels would be made of a new type of material that can absorb and store energy more efficiently than traditional solar panels.",
    "The new energy source would be called \"Bioluminescent Energy\" and it would be generated through the use of living organisms. These organisms would be genetically modified to produce a brighter and more efficient light. The energy would be captured and converted into electricity through the use of specialized equipment. This new technology would provide a sustainable and renewable source of energy that could be used for lighting and other applications.",
    "The new energy source would be called \"Kinetic Energy\" and it would be generated through the movement of people or objects. This technology would involve the installation of sensors and cameras in public spaces that can detect the movement of people and objects. The energy generated would be captured and converted into electricity, which could be used to power streetlights, traffic signals, and other public infrastructure.",
    "The new energy source would be called \"Magnetic Energy\" and it would be generated through the use of magnetic fields. This technology would involve the installation of magnetic coils in public spaces that can capture and store energy from the movement of vehicles and other magnetic objects. The energy generated would be captured and converted into electricity, which could be used to power streetlights, traffic signals, and other public infrastructure."
