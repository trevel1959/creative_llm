    "**Eco-Friendly Skin**: The skin would be composed of a unique, self-healing material that can absorb and convert pollutants into harmless substances, protecting the body from environmental toxins. This would be achieved through a network of microorganisms that break down pollutants, producing oxygen and nutrients as byproducts. This eco-friendly skin would also have enhanced water-repellent properties, reducing the need for artificial moisturizers.",
    "**Adaptive Limbs**: The limbs would be designed with interchangeable, modular components, allowing for effortless adaptation to different environments and activities. For example, the hands could transform into paddles for swimming or into grasping claws for climbing. This modularity would also enable the limbs to be easily repaired or replaced, reducing the risk of injury or disability.",
    "**Efficient Respiratory System**: The lungs would be redesigned to be more efficient, with the ability to extract oxygen from both air and water. This would allow humans to thrive in a variety of aquatic environments, from shallow pools to deep-sea ecosystems. The lungs would also be equipped with a sophisticated filtration system, capable of removing pollutants and toxins from the air.",
    "**Advanced Sensory Organs**: The sensory organs would be upgraded to include a range of enhanced senses, such as:    - **Electroreception**: The ability to perceive electromagnetic fields, allowing for navigation and communication in environments with limited visibility.",
    "**Regenerative Organs**: The organs would be designed to regenerate and repair themselves at an accelerated rate, reducing the risk of disease and injury. This would be achieved through the integration of advanced stem cells, capable of differentiating into any cell type, and a network of microorganisms that aid in the healing process. The organs would also be equipped with a sophisticated immune system, capable of detecting and eliminating cancer cells and other pathogens."
