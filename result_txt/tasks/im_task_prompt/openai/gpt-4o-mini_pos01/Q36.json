    "**Self-Sharpening Blade Mechanism**: Create a knife with a built-in self-sharpening mechanism. The blade could be designed with a special material or technology that maintains its sharpness through friction or a sliding mechanism. This would reduce the need for regular sharpening, ensuring that the knife is always ready for use without the hassle of maintenance.",
    "**Interchangeable Blade System**: Introduce a knife with interchangeable blades that can be easily swapped out depending on the task at hand. The handle could have a secure locking mechanism that allows users to change blades for different purposes, such as filleting fish, chopping vegetables, or slicing bread. This would enhance versatility and reduce the need for multiple knives in the kitchen.",
    "**Ergonomic Handle with Adjustable Grip**: Design a knife with an ergonomic handle that allows users to adjust the grip size according to their hand size or preference. This could involve a telescoping handle or a moldable material that conforms to the user's grip. Such a design would improve comfort and control, reducing the risk of accidents during use.",
    "**Integrated Cutting Board**: Create a knife that features a retractable cutting board attached to its handle. When the knife is not in use, the cutting board can be folded away for easy storage. When needed, the board can be deployed, allowing for seamless slicing and dicing without the need for an additional surface. This would be particularly useful for outdoor cooking or picnics.",
    "**Color-Changing Blade for Safety**: Innovate a knife with a color-changing blade that reacts to temperature or pH levels of the food being cut. For example, if the knife is used on raw meat, it could change color to indicate that it's been contaminated, reminding users to clean it before using it on other foods. This feature would enhance food safety and hygiene in the kitchen."
