    "**Kid-Friendly Economy**: The global economy is overhauled to cater to the needs and desires of children. Currency is replaced by candy, toys, and other treats, and the concept of money becomes obsolete. Businesses are designed to provide services and products that bring joy and happiness to children, such as theme parks, video game development, and candy manufacturing.",
    "**Parent-Child Flip**: The traditional parent-child dynamic is reversed, and children become the authority figures, while adults are relegated to being their caregivers. This leads to a society where children are free to make their own decisions, and adults are tasked with ensuring their well-being and happiness.",
    "**Kid-Centric Infrastructure**: Cities are redesigned to prioritize the needs of children, with streets filled with playgrounds, parks, and playground equipment. Buildings are constructed with slides, swings, and climbing walls, and public transportation is replaced by bike lanes and skate parks.",
    "**Imagination-Based Technology**: Technology is developed to amplify children's creativity and imagination. Virtual reality headsets and augmented reality glasses become the norm, allowing kids to create and explore new worlds and scenarios. Artificial intelligence is designed to assist and augment their creative endeavors, rather than replace them.",
    "**Childhood Aspirations**: Children's dreams and aspirations become the driving force behind innovation and progress. Research focuses on developing solutions to problems that kids care about, such as climate change, social justice, and animal welfare. Children's imaginations and creativity are harnessed to develop sustainable solutions and innovative technologies."
