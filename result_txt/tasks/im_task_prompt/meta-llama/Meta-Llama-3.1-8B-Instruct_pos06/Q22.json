    "**Solar-Powered Flashlight with Integrated Solar Panel**: Design a flashlight with an integrated solar panel that can harness energy from the sun during the day, allowing the user to have a reliable light source at night without needing batteries. The solar panel would be placed on the back or side of the flashlight, and a small battery would be used to store excess energy generated during the day for use at night. This design would make the flashlight self-sustaining and environmentally friendly.",
    "**Smart Flashlight with Motion Detection and Alarm**: Create a smart flashlight that can detect motion and sound an alarm if it detects any suspicious activity. The flashlight would be equipped with a motion sensor and a speaker, allowing it to alert the user or others in the surrounding area of potential threats. This feature would be particularly useful for hikers, campers, or people who work late at night.",
    "**Flashlight with Built-in First Aid Kit**: Design a flashlight that also contains a built-in first aid kit, complete with bandages, antiseptic wipes, and pain relievers. The first aid kit would be stored in a compartment within the flashlight, and the user could access it by pressing a button or sliding a panel. This feature would be useful for outdoor enthusiasts or people who work in remote areas.",
    "**Flashlight with Integrated GPS and Compass**: Create a flashlight that includes a built-in GPS and compass, allowing the user to navigate even in complete darkness. The GPS would provide location information, while the compass would help the user determine direction. This feature would be particularly useful for hikers, campers, or people who get lost in the wilderness.",
    "**Flashlight with Programmable Color and Strobe Modes**: Design a flashlight that can change color and strobe pattern to alert others or signal for help in emergency situations. The flashlight would be equipped with a microcontroller and a series of LEDs, allowing it to display a variety of colors and patterns. This feature would be useful for people who work in hazardous environments or need to signal for help in emergency situations."
