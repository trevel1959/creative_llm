    "Magnetic Art: Create a collection of magnetic art pieces that can be easily displayed on any metal surface. Each piece can be designed to represent a different aspect of magnetism, such as the Earth's magnetic field, magnetic levitation, or the attraction between magnets. The pieces can be made from a variety of materials, including metal, plastic, and even recycled materials.",
    "Magnetic Games: Develop a series of magnetic games that can be played with different types of magnets. For example, a game called \"Magnetic Tiles\" could involve players building structures using magnetic tiles and seeing how long they can keep them standing. Another game called \"Magnetic Maze\" could involve navigating a magnetic ball through a maze using a magnet to control its movement.",
    "Magnetic Fashion: Create a line of clothing and accessories that incorporate magnets as a design element. For example, a dress could have magnetic strips sewn into the fabric to create a dynamic, flowing design. A pair of shoes could have magnets in the soles to create a magnetic field that interacts with the Earth's magnetic field, creating a unique sensation for the wearer.",
    "Magnetic Music: Develop a musical instrument that uses magnets as a primary component. For example, a magnetic guitar could have magnetic pickups that use the Earth's magnetic field to create a unique sound. A magnetic drum set could use magnets to create a resonant, percussive sound.",
    "Magnetic Food: Create a line of food products that incorporate magnets as an ingredient. For example, a magnetic spice blend could be made by mixing together a variety of spices and magnetic particles. A magnetic smoothie could be created by blending together fruit and vegetables with magnetic particles. The magnetic particles could provide a unique flavor and texture to the food, and could also have health benefits due to their magnetic properties."
