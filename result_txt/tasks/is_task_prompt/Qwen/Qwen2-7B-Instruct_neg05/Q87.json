    "**Online Challenge Series**: Launch an online series of challenges aimed at helping individuals improve their creative skills. Each week, a new challenge would be posted, such as creating a piece of art based on a specific emotion, writing a short story with a unique plot twist, or composing a song about overcoming obstacles. Participants can share their creations on social media using a designated hashtag, fostering a sense of community and motivation.",
    "**Creative Workshops in Non-traditional Settings**: Offer creative workshops in non-traditional settings, such as parks, cafes, or even online through virtual reality platforms.
