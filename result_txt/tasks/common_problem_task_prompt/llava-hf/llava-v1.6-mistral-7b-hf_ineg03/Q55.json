    "**Human-Wildlife Conflict:** As the park is established, there may be conflicts between humans and wildlife. This could involve encroachment on human settlements, agricultural lands, or infrastructure, which could lead to property damage or loss of crops. Conversely, the park may also face challenges in providing a safe and undisturbed habitat for the wildlife, which could lead to conflicts with nearby human populations.",

This could involve assessing the impact of the park on local water resources, soil quality, and plant and animal species.",
    "**Infrastructure and Accessibility:** Establishing a nature conservation park may require the development of infrastructure, such as roads, bridges, and visitor facilities. This could lead to challenges in ensuring that the park is accessible to visitors while minimizing the impact on the environment.",
    "**Education and Awareness:** To promote the park's conservation efforts, it is essential to educate and raise awareness among local communities and visitors. This could involve developing educational programs, creating signage, and conducting guided tours.",
