    "**Fresh Water Collection System**: Finding a reliable source of fresh water is crucial for survival. I would look for natural sources such as streams or rivers, but if none are available, I would create a rainwater collection system. Using large leaves or any containers I can find, I would set them out during rain showers to catch water. Additionally, I could dig a shallow hole in the sand, line it with leaves, and wait for moisture to accumulate overnight.",
    "**Food Foraging and Fishing**: To sustain myself, I would forage for edible plants, fruits, and nuts native to the island. I would educate myself on local flora and avoid anything that looks suspicious. Additionally, I would craft a simple fishing spear using a sharpened stick to catch fish in shallow waters. If possible, I would create a fish trap using rocks and branches to increase my chances of a successful catch.",
    "**Shelter Building**: To protect myself from the elements, I would construct a makeshift shelter using available resources like palm fronds, branches, and leaves. I would look for a location that is elevated and away from potential flooding. The shelter would be designed to provide shade during the day and warmth at night, with an entrance facing away from prevailing winds. I could also insulate the shelter with leaves to keep it warm.",
    "**Signage for Rescue**: To increase the chances of being rescued, I would create large signs on the beach using rocks, logs, or sand. I would arrange them to spell out “HELP” or an SOS signal that is visible from the air. This would act as a visual cue for any passing aircraft or ships, indicating that someone is in distress on the island.",
    "**Natural Navigation**: If I find myself on the island for an extended period, I would familiarize myself with the island’s geography to navigate effectively. I would create a simple map using landmarks like mountains, rivers, or unique trees. By observing the sun’s position and the stars at night, I could develop a sense of direction and possibly find a way to signal for help or explore the island for resources."
