    "Emotional Memory Tissue Boxes: These tissue boxes would be designed to hold not only tissues, but also memories. They would have a small compartment or pocket where users could store a small memento or token related to a specific memory or emotion. When the user needs to blow their nose, they could also reflect on the memory associated with the memento.",
    "Scented Tissue Boxes: These tissue boxes would be infused with a specific scent that is associated with a particular emotion or mood. For example, a lavender-scented tissue box could be designed to promote relaxation and calmness, while a peppermint-scented tissue box could be designed to invigorate and refresh.",
    "Tissue Box Art: These tissue boxes would be designed with unique and creative artwork on the outside. They could feature abstract designs, nature scenes, or even famous works of art. The artwork could be printed on the entire tissue box or just the top surface, and could be changed every few months to keep things interesting.",
    "Tissue Box Games: These tissue boxes would be designed with games or puzzles printed on the outside. Users could play simple games like tic-tac-toe or Sudoku while blowing their noses, or they could solve more complex puzzles to uncover a hidden message or design.",
    "Tissue Box Music: These tissue boxes would be designed with built-in speakers that play soothing music or nature sounds when the user blows their nose. The music could be customizable, with users able to choose from a variety of genres or moods to suit their needs."
