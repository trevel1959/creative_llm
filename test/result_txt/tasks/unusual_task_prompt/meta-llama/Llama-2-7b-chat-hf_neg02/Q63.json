    "Smart Candlelit Dinner: Create a candlestick that can change colors and scents based on the type of food being served at a dinner party. For example, a blue candle could represent a seafood dish, while a green candle could represent a vegetarian option. The candlestick could also change its shape and size to match the size and shape of the dinner plate.",
    "Candlelight Virtual Reality: Develop a candlestick that projects a virtual reality environment using light. The candlestick could be placed on a table and as the flame flickers, it could create a 3D projection of a beach, mountain range, or any other environment. This would allow people to experience a different world while enjoying their meal.",
    "Interactive Candle: Create a candlestick that can sense when someone is nearby and change its color or scent based on their mood. For example, if someone is feeling sad, the candlestick could change to a soothing blue color and emit a calming scent. If someone is feeling happy, the candlestick could change to a bright yellow color and emit a cheerful scent.",
    "Candlelight Art: Develop a candlestick that can create art using light. The candlestick could have a series of small mirrors that reflect the light of the flame, creating a pattern or image on a nearby surface. The image could be a still life, a landscape, or any other design. This would allow people to enjoy both the ambiance of a candle and the beauty of art.",
    "Candlelight Music: Create a candlestick that can change the tone and pitch of a person's voice based on their mood. The candlestick could use sensors to detect changes in the person's emotions and adjust the tone and pitch of their voice accordingly. This would allow people to express themselves in a unique and creative way, using the candlestick as a form of vocal manipulation."
