    "**Self-Standing Umbrella**: Design an umbrella with a weighted base that allows it to stand on its own when not in use. This feature would be particularly useful at outdoor cafes or picnics, where users can set the umbrella down without needing to hold it. The base could be detachable for easy transport and storage.",
    "**Solar-Powered Charging Umbrella**: Create an umbrella with solar panels integrated into the canopy. These panels would harness sunlight to charge devices via USB ports located on the handle. This way, users can keep their devices charged while enjoying the outdoors, making it perfect for beach days or camping trips.",
    "**Convertible Umbrella-Raincoat Combo**: Innovate an umbrella that can transform into a raincoat. The canopy can detach and fold into a compact, waterproof poncho that covers the wearer. This dual-function design would be ideal for unexpected downpours, allowing users to stay dry without carrying multiple items.",
    "**Personalized Design Umbrella**: Develop an umbrella that allows users to customize the canopy design with interchangeable panels. Users can select from a variety of patterns, colors, or even upload their own images. This would cater to personal style and make the umbrella a fashionable accessory rather than just a functional item.",
    "**Wind-Resistant Umbrella with Automatic Reinforcement**: Create an umbrella with a built-in mechanism that detects strong winds and automatically reinforces the frame. This could involve expanding the rib structure or tightening the canopy to prevent inversion and breakage. This feature would enhance durability and user confidence during stormy weather."
