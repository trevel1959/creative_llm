    "Air-Borne Transportation: In a world where all roads become impassable, people could turn to air-based transportation as an alternative. This could include hot air balloons, blimps, and airships. These modes of transportation would allow people to travel long distances while avoiding the obstacles on the ground.",
    "Waterways: If all roads become impassable, people could turn to waterways as an alternative mode of transportation. This could include boats, canoes, and kayaks. Traveling by water would allow people to navigate around the obstacles on land and reach their destinations efficiently.",
    "Maglev Trains: Magnetic levitation trains, or maglev trains, are a mode of transportation that uses magnetic fields to lift and propel trains above the ground. These trains would be able to travel at high speeds without the need for roads, making them an ideal option for traveling long distances in a world where all roads are impassable.",
    "Pneumatic Tubes: Pneumatic tubes are a mode of transportation that uses compressed air to propel capsules through a network of tubes. These tubes could be built underground, allowing people to travel long distances without the need for roads. This mode of transportation would be especially useful in urban areas where space is limited.",
    "Exo-Skeletons: Exo-skeletons are wearable devices that use motors and actuators to enhance the wearer's strength and mobility. With the help of exo-skeletons, people could travel long distances without the need for roads. These devices could be used for both personal and commercial transportation, allowing people to travel quickly and efficiently."
