    "Waste Management App: Create an innovative waste management app that allows users to report the location of any missing trash cans. The app can also provide information on nearby recycling centers and composting facilities. Users can earn points or rewards for reporting trash can locations, which can be redeemed for discounts on local eco-friendly products or services.",
    "Community Composting Initiative: Organize a community-wide composting program, where residents can drop off their organic waste at designated locations. This waste can then be collected and processed into nutrient-rich compost that can be used in local gardens and parks. This initiative can also educate residents on the benefits of composting and how it can reduce waste.",
    "Trash-to-Art Program: Establish a program where artists can submit designs for trash cans that are both functional and aesthetically pleasing. The city can then commission the artists to create the trash cans, which can be placed in high-traffic areas. This program can not only provide a unique solution to the trash can problem but also promote artistic expression and community engagement.",
    "Smart Trash Cans: Develop smart trash cans that can detect the type of waste placed inside and sort it automatically. These cans can also track the amount of waste generated in each area and provide real-time data to city officials, allowing them to optimize waste management strategies. This technology can also reduce the need for manual sorting and increase efficiency in waste collection.",
    "Waste-to-Energy Facility: Build a waste-to-energy facility that converts non-recyclable waste into electricity or fuel. This facility can reduce the amount of waste sent to landfills and provide a sustainable source of energy for the city. The facility can also be designed to produce minimal emissions and pollution, making it an environmentally friendly solution."
