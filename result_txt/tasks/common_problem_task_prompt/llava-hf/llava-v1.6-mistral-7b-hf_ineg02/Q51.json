    "**Guest Accommodation**: Finding suitable accommodation for attendees, especially if the event is taking place in a location with limited hotel availability, can be a challenge. Ensuring that all attendees have a place to stay during the event may require working with multiple hotels or arranging for a temporary housing solution.",
    "**Catering Services**: Catering for a large-scale event can be complicated. The caterer must have the ability to provide enough food and beverages to keep the attendees well-fed throughout the event. There is also the need to accommodate any dietary restrictions or preferences (vegetarian, vegan, gluten-free, etc.) among the attendees, which could demand more specialization from the caterer.",
    "**Event Timing and Scheduling**: Coordinating the timeline of the event, including the start and end times, is crucial. If the schedule is too packed or activities run over time, attendees may miss their flights, appointments, or other commitments. On the other hand, if there are gaps in the schedule, it could lead to boredom or dissatisfaction.",
    "**Communication and Logistics**: Effective communication with all parties involved, from attendees and caterers to venue staff and travel agencies, is key. Miscommunication or a lack of logistical planning could lead to confusion, delays, or even failures on the day of the event. This includes providing clear instructions to all parties, ensuring that everyone knows their role and responsibilities, and providing accurate and timely updates throughout the planning process.",
    "**Security and Safety**: Since large-scale events can attract a wide range of people, it's important to consider the level of security required. This can include hiring security personnel, providing clear signage or maps, and ensuring that emergency exits are not blocked to facilitate a safe environment."
