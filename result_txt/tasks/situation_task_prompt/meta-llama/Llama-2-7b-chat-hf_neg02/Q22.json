    "Personal Air Vehicles: With all roads disappearing, individuals could use personal air vehicles like hoverbikes or jetpacks to navigate their town or city. These vehicles would provide a quick and efficient means of transportation, allowing people to travel long distances without the need for roads.",
    "Magnetic Sleds: Another option would be to use magnetic sleds that could glide along magnetic paths created by a network of underground magnets. These sleds could be powered by electricity or even solar energy, making them a sustainable and eco-friendly option.",
    "Waterways: If the disappearance of roads were to occur in a coastal or riverine area, people could use boats and watercraft to move around. This would provide a unique and adventurous way of navigating the town or city, and could also be a great opportunity for recreational activities like fishing or sailing.",
    "Gravity-Defying Transportation: With the absence of roads, people could turn to gravity-defying transportation methods like sky bikes or hovercycles. These vehicles would use advanced technology to counteract the force of gravity, allowing riders to soar through the air with ease.",
    "Underground Tunnels: In areas where the disappearance of roads was not total, people could use existing underground tunnels and subway systems to move around. These tunnels could be expanded and improved upon to accommodate more traffic, providing a safe and efficient means of transportation."
