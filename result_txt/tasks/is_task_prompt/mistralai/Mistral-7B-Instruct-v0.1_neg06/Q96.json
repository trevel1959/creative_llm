    "The witch without a broomstick is not actually a witch. It's a clever play on words that implies that the witch is not capable of flying, but in reality, the witch has found other ways to get around. For example, she could be using a vacuum car, a motorcycle, or a bicycle.",
    "The witch without a broomstick is a of the witch's lack of power. Perhaps she has been stripped of her powers by a spell or curse, or perhaps she has lost her powers due to a lack of practice.",
    "The witch without a broomstick is a parody of the classic witch archetype. In this version, the witch has decided to take a more modern approach to magic, using technology and science to perform her spells.",
    "The witch without a broomstick is a representation of the witch's vulnerability. Perhaps she is of being by a powerful spell or curse, or perhaps she is of beingering by a powerful enemy.",
    "The witch without a broomstick is a symbol of the witch's creativity. Perhaps she has found other ways to get around that are more unique and creative than just riding a broomstick. For example, she could be using a skateboard, a unicycle, or a kiteboard."
