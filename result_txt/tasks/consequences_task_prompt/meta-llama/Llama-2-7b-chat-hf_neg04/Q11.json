    "Increased Tidal Forces: With two moons, the gravitational forces on Earth would be much stronger, causing more extreme tides and potentially catastrophic coastal flooding.",
    "Unpredictable Orbits: The orbits of the two moons would be unpredictable and prone to collision, leading to chaotic and unstable motion.",
    "Gravity Shifts: The additional moon would cause a shift in the gravitational pull on Earth, affecting the planet's rotation, axis tilt, and potentially leading to catastrophic consequences such as earthquakes and volcanic eruptions.",
    "Eclipses and Lunar Phenomena: The two moons would create unique and rare celestial events such as double eclipses, moon duos, and gravitational tides.",
    "Tidal Locking: If the two moons were similar in size and close enough to Earth, they could become tidally locked, resulting in one side of each moon permanently facing the planet, while the other side would be in perpetual darkness."
