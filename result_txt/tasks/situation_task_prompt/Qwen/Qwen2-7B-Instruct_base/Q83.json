    "**Daytime Sleep Pods**: In a world without night, people might have to adapt by designing sleep pods that can be used during the day. These pods could be designed with special lighting that mimics the darkness of night, allowing individuals to feel as if they are sleeping in the dark. They might also include features like noise-cancelling headphones or white noise machines to block out any distracting sounds. ",
    "**Adjustable Circadian Rhythms**: Another creative idea is for humans to adjust their circadian rhythms so they can sleep during the day instead of at night. This could involve a gradual shift over time through diet adjustments, light exposure changes, and lifestyle modifications. Special supplements or medications might also be developed to assist with this adaptation.",
    "**Bioluminescent Sleepwear**: If night-time light isn't an option, individuals could wear bioluminescent clothing that emits a gentle glow, creating the illusion of darkness while still being able to see. These clothes would be designed with energy-efficient LED lights or other sustainable technologies, minimizing their impact on the environment.",
    "**Virtual Reality Dreams**: In a world without night, people might experience their dreams through virtual reality (VR) technology. Using advanced VR headsets, users could enter dream-like environments that simulate the peacefulness and darkness of a night's rest. These experiences could be personalized based on individual preferences, ensuring a comfortable and restful sleep-like state.",
    "**Solar-Powered Sleep Chambers**: Solar-powered chambers could be designed to harness the sun's energy during the day, storing it for use when needed. These chambers would be equipped with sensors to detect light levels and adjust their internal environment accordingly. They might also include air purification systems and temperature control mechanisms to ensure a comfortable sleep environment regardless of external conditions."
