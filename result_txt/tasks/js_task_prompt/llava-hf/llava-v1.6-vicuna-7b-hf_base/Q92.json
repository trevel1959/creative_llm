    "Interconnected Space Stations: Instead of having individual planets, the solar system would be composed of interconnected space stations that rotate around a central sun. These stations would be connected by a network of space elevators, allowing for easy transportation of goods and people.",
    "Artificial Gravity: To make the space stations more habitable, artificial gravity could be generated using centrifugal force. This would create a more comfortable living environment for the inhabitants of the solar system.",
    "Solar Sailing: Instead of relying on rockets for propulsion, spacecraft could use solar sails to harness the power of the sun's light to travel through the solar system. This would make interplanetary travel much faster and more efficient.",
    "Nanotechnology-Based Life Support: To support life on the planets, nanotechnology-based life support systems could be implemented. These systems would use microscopic robots to clean and maintain the environment, recycle resources, and even repair damages.",
    "Fusion Power Plants: The solar system could be powered by fusion power plants that harness the energy from the sun's core. This would provide a virtually limitless source of energy for the planets and reduce their carbon footprint."
