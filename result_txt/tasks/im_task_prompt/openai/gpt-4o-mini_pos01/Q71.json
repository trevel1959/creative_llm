    "**Built-in Sleep Tracker**: Incorporate a sleep monitoring system within the sleeping bag that tracks the user's sleep patterns, duration, and quality. This data could be synced to a smartphone app, providing insights into sleep quality and suggestions for improvement. It could also include gentle vibration alarms to wake the user at the optimal time in their sleep cycle.",
    "**Modular Design**: Create a sleeping bag with detachable sections that can be added or removed based on the userâ€™s needs.

This versatility allows for year-round use and customization based on different camping environments.",
    "**Integrated Lighting System**: Add a built-in LED lighting system with adjustable brightness that can be controlled via a smartphone app or a simple button on the bag. This feature would allow users to read, navigate, or find items inside the bag without needing an external flashlight, enhancing convenience during nighttime activities.",
    "**Eco-Friendly Materials**: Develop a sleeping bag made from fully biodegradable or recycled materials, ensuring it has a minimal environmental impact. Additionally, the insulation could be derived from sustainable sources, such as recycled plastics or natural fibers, appealing to eco-conscious consumers.",
    "**Multi-Purpose Features**: Design a sleeping bag that can transform into different forms, such as a blanket, hammock, or even a shelter. This multifunctionality would be particularly useful for backpackers and campers who want to minimize gear and maximize versatility in various situations."
