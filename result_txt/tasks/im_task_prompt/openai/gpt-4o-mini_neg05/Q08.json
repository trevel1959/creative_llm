    "**Adjustable Temperature Zones**: Design a refrigerator with customizable temperature zones that can be adjusted based on the type of food stored. For example, a section for fruits and vegetables could maintain a higher humidity level, while a section for dairy products could be kept at a lower temperature. This would help preserve the freshness and quality of various food items.",
    "**Integrated Water Filtration and Infusion System**: Incorporate a water filtration system directly into the refrigerator that allows users to infuse their water with fruits or herbs. A compartment could hold fruits or herbs that would flavor the water as it dispenses, encouraging healthier hydration habits. Users could customize their infusions and even create sparkling water with a built-in carbonation feature.",
    "**Eco-Friendly Cooling Technology**: Develop refrigerators that utilize eco-friendly cooling technologies, such as thermoelectric cooling or magnetic refrigeration. These methods reduce energy consumption and eliminate harmful refrigerants. Additionally, the fridge could be powered by solar panels, making it an environmentally sustainable option for households.",
    "**Self-Cleaning Interior**: Introduce a self-cleaning feature that uses UV light and ozone technology to sanitize the interior of the refrigerator. This system would eliminate bacteria and odors without the need for harsh chemicals. Users could activate the self-cleaning mode at their convenience, ensuring a hygienic storage environment for food.",
    "**Interactive Touchscreen Interface**: Create a refrigerator with an interactive touchscreen interface on the door that serves as a family hub. Users could display calendars, notes, and shopping lists, as well as browse recipes and meal planning ideas. The interface could sync with other smart home devices, allowing for seamless integration and control of the kitchen environment."
