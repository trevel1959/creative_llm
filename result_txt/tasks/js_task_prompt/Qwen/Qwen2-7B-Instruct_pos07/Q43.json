    "**Crime Prevention and Detection:** Imagine a world where crime rates dramatically decrease due to your ability to see through walls. You could monitor entire neighborhoods or buildings in real-time, detecting illegal activities such as theft, vandalism, or drug dealing before they occur. This proactive approach could significantly aid law enforcement agencies by providing them with timely intelligence to prevent crimes.",
    "**Urban Planning and Construction:** With the ability to see through walls, architects and urban planners could optimize building designs and layouts without the need for invasive or costly exploratory drilling or excavations. This would save time and resources while ensuring safety and compliance with building codes. Additionally, it could help identify underground utilities, hazardous materials, or potential structural issues before construction begins.",
    "**Environmental Monitoring:** Utilize your power to detect pollution sources or environmental hazards beneath the surface of the earth. This could be particularly useful in identifying contaminated sites, monitoring water quality in aquifers, or locating natural resources like oil, gas, or minerals. Such information would be invaluable for environmental conservation efforts, public health initiatives, and resource management.",
    "**Historical Archaeology and Preservation:** As an archaeologist, you could uncover historical sites and artifacts that are hidden from view or inaccessible due to physical barriers. This would not only enrich our understanding of human history but also preserve valuable cultural heritage. By seeing through walls, you could determine the extent of archaeological deposits, locate artifacts without causing damage, and guide excavation efforts more effectively.",
    "**Medical Diagnostics and Treatment:** Imagine a future where doctors could diagnose diseases and injuries using a patientâ€™s unseen anatomy. By \"seeing\" through their skin, bones, and organs, they could identify tumors, fractures, or other medical conditions earlier than traditional imaging techniques. This could lead to more accurate diagnoses, better treatment outcomes, and potentially save lives. Additionally, this technology could revolutionize surgery by allowing precise targeting of procedures without the need for incisions."
