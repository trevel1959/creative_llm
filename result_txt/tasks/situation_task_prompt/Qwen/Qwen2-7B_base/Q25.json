    "Staircase: If the elevator is not available, we can use stairs to reach the top of the skyscraper. Staircases are a practical and efficient solution for small rises, however for a tall building, it may take a long time, be strenuous and may prove to be too difficult for people with health or age-related issues.",
    "Escalator: An escalator can be used to reach a higher floor of a skyscraper quickly. It's efficient and people can walk up to the higher floor without much effort. However, the escalator may not be available in all cases, especially in old buildings or damaged equipment.",
    "Cargo lift: It is used to transport cargo or materials in elevators and other vertical systems. It can also be used to transport people, if needed. It is fast and safe, but might be difficult to find and operate without specialized equipment.",
    "Climb up the fire escape ladder: If the situation is an emergency and moving quickly is important, the fire escape ladder may provide an alternative way to bypass the elevator. However, it is not a commonly used method.",
    "Helicopter hoist: If all else fails, a helicopter hoist may be used to transport people to the top of the skyscraper. However, this option is costly and time-consuming."
