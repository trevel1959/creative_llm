    "The Toothbrush of the Future: Create a toothbrush that uses advanced technology to provide a more efficient and personalized oral hygiene experience. The toothbrush could have multiple brushing modes, such as a gentle mode for sensitive teeth and gums, a whitening mode for removing surface stains, and a deep clean mode for removing plaque and tartar. The toothbrush could also have built-in sensors that track brushing habits and provide personalized recommendations for improvement.",
    "Toothbrush with Built-in Water Flosser: Design a toothbrush that incorporates a built-in water flosser for a more thorough cleaning experience. The toothbrush could have a detachable water tank that holds enough water for several uses, and a small pump that directs a stream of water between the teeth and gums. This would allow users to floss and brush their teeth simultaneously, saving time and effort.",
    "Smart Toothbrush with AI Technology: Create a toothbrush that uses artificial intelligence (AI) to provide personalized oral hygiene recommendations and track brushing habits. The toothbrush could have a small display screen that shows statistics on brushing time, pressure, and technique, as well as recommendations for improvement. The toothbrush could also use AI to detect and alert users of any oral health issues, such as tooth decay or gum disease.",
    "Customizable Toothbrush: Design a toothbrush that allows users to customize the bristle length, shape, and texture to suit their individual needs. The toothbrush could have interchangeable bristle heads that can be purchased in different configurations, allowing users to choose the best option for their teeth and gums. This would provide a more personalized and comfortable brushing experience.",
    "Toothbrush with Built-in Sanitizer: Create a toothbrush that incorporates a built-in sanitizer to kill bacteria and germs on the toothbrush. The sanitizer could be a small UV light or a disinfectant reservoir that is emptied after each use. This would provide an additional layer of protection against oral infections and reduce the risk"
