The truck's design could include interactive elements like touchscreen menus or digital recipe cards.",
    "**Sustainable Eats Truck**: Catering to the growing trend of environmental consciousness, this food truck could focus on serving plant-based meals, locally-sourced vegetarian options, and even offer compostable packaging.

The truck could feature solar panels and a rainwater collection system for cleaning produce, adding to its green appeal.",
    "**Adventure-Themed Food Truck**: This concept revolves around a theme inspired by travel and adventure, such as a \"Mountain Trekker's Kitchen\" or a \"Tropical Island Feast.\" The truck's exterior could be decorated with elements reminiscent of different travel destinations, like maps, compasses, or exotic plants. The menu would offer hearty, portable meals suitable for hikers, campers, or anyone looking for a taste of adventure.
