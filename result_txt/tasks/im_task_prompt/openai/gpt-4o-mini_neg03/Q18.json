    "**Eco-Feedback Dashboard**: Develop a dashboard that not only provides real-time data about the car’s performance but also gives feedback on eco-driving habits. It could analyze driving patterns, such as acceleration and braking, and offer suggestions to improve fuel efficiency. The system could gamify eco-driving by awarding points for sustainable practices, encouraging drivers to adopt greener habits.",
    "**Augmented Reality Windshield**: Transform the traditional windshield into an augmented reality (AR) display that provides critical information without distracting the driver. Navigation directions, speed limits, and hazard alerts could be projected directly onto the windshield. This AR interface could also highlight points of interest along the route, providing real-time information about nearby attractions, restaurants, and fuel stations.",
    "**Multi-Functional Steering Wheel**: Redesign the steering wheel to include touch-sensitive controls that can be customized based on the driver’s needs. This could include gesture controls for media playback, voice command integration, and even health monitoring features like a heart rate sensor. The steering wheel could also provide haptic feedback for navigation prompts, ensuring that drivers can keep their eyes on the road.",
    "**Integrated Wellness System**: Introduce a wellness system within the car that focuses on the health and well-being of the driver and passengers. This could include air purification systems, aromatherapy options, and even built-in massage features in the seats. Additionally, the car could have a mindfulness mode that plays calming sounds or guided meditation during stressful traffic conditions, promoting relaxation.",
    "**Dynamic Exterior Color Changing**: Equip cars with a skin that can change color based on the driver’s mood, weather conditions, or even for safety purposes. Using advanced materials and technology, the car could shift its color for aesthetic reasons, or turn bright colors when parked to signal to pedestrians or other drivers. This feature could also include customizable designs for special occasions or personal expression."
