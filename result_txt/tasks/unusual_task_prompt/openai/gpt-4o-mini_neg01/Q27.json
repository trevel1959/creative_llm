    "**Portable Phone Stand**: When you're on the go and need to prop up your phone for a video call or to watch a movie, use your sunglasses! Simply flip the arms of the sunglasses outward and place the phone in between the lenses. The curvature of the lenses can create a stable base, making it a handy and creative phone stand.",
    "**Miniature Greenhouse**: Use your old sunglasses to create a small greenhouse for seedlings. Place the sunglasses upside down over small pots or seed trays to trap heat and moisture. The tinted lenses can help filter sunlight, preventing young plants from getting scorched, while also adding a quirky aesthetic to your gardening setup.",
    "**Artistic Wall Decor**: Repurpose old sunglasses into a unique piece of wall art. Arrange them in an eye-catching pattern or design, such as a sunburst or abstract shape, and mount them in a shadow box or directly on the wall. This not only recycles the sunglasses but also creates a conversation starter for guests.",
    "**Pet Safety Goggles**: If you have a pet that loves to go on car rides or outdoor adventures, consider modifying a pair of sunglasses to fit them. This can protect their eyes from harmful UV rays, dust, and debris. Use soft, adjustable straps to ensure a comfortable fit and make sure the lenses are pet-safe.",
    "**Sunglasses Painting**: Create a fun art project by using sunglasses as a stencil for painting. Dip the lenses in paint and press them onto canvas or paper to create unique circular patterns. This can be a fun activity for kids or adults, allowing for creativity and experimentation with colors and designs."
