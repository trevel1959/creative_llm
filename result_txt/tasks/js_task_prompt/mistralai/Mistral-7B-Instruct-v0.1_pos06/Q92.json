    "I would create a solar system with a central star that is a black hole. This would create a unique and dynamic system, as the black hole would attract and repel planets and other celestial bodies. The black hole would also provide a source of energy for the planets, allowing for the possibility of advanced technologies and life forms.",
    "I would create a solar system with multiple suns. This would create a complex and fascinating system, with planets orbiting around multiple stars. The multiple suns would create a variety of climates and environments on the planets, leading to a diverse range of life forms.",
    "I would create a solar system with a giant gas giant at its center. This would create a massive and powerful system, with the gas giant dominating the gravitational pull. The gas giant would also create a strong magnetic field, protecting the planets from harmful radiation and cosmic rays.",
    "I would create a solar system with a central star that is a white dwarf. This would create a stable and peaceful system, with the white dwarf providing a source of energy for the planets. The white dwarf would also create a protective bubble around the solar system, shielding it from harmful radiation and cosmic rays.",
    "I would create a solar system with a central star that is a pulsar. This would create a rapidly rotating and dynamic system, with the pulsar providing a source of energy for the planets. The pulsar would also create strong gravitational forces, leading to the formation of unique and fascinating celestial bodies."
