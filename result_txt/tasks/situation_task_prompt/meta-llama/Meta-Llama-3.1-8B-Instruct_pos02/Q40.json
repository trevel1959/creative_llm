    "**Solar-Powered Backpack**: Design a backpack with built-in solar panels that can charge devices on the go. The backpack would have a sleek and durable design, with multiple pockets for storing devices and accessories. The solar panels would be made of high-efficiency materials, allowing for maximum energy harvesting. The backpack would also have a built-in battery that can store excess energy for later use, ensuring that devices stay powered even on cloudy days.",
    "**Kinetic Energy Harvesting Shoes**: Develop shoes that harness kinetic energy from footsteps and convert it into electrical energy. The shoes would have built-in piezoelectric materials that generate electricity with every step. The energy would be stored in a small battery, which could then be used to charge devices or power small appliances. The shoes would also have a sleek and stylish design, making them a fashionable way to generate power.",
    "**Atmospheric Water Harvesting Device**: Create a device that can extract water from the air, even in arid environments. The device would use a proprietary membrane that can capture water vapor from the atmosphere, condense it, and store it in a tank. The water could then be used to generate electricity through a hydroelectric turbine or fuel cell. This device would be particularly useful in areas where access to clean water is limited.",
    "**Bioluminescent Light Source**: Develop a bioluminescent material that can be used to create a sustainable light source. The material would be made from a combination of microorganisms and a specialized substrate that allows them to thrive. The microorganisms would emit a soft, blue-green light that could be used to power devices or illuminate spaces. The bioluminescent material would be durable, long-lasting, and require minimal maintenance.",
    "**Thermoelectric Roadways**: Design a network of roadways that incorporate thermoelectric materials, which can convert heat from vehicles into electricity. The roadways would be made of a specialized material that can absorb and convert heat from passing vehicles, generating electricity that could be used to power streetlights, traffic signals, or other urban infrastructure. The roadways would also have a sleek and modern design, making them a futuristic addition to any city. [/INST] "
