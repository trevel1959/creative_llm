    "**Everest Exploration Expedition**: Offer guided expeditions to Mount Everest for experienced climbers who want to explore the mountain beyond the traditional climbing routes. These expeditions could focus on scientific research, such as studying the effects of climate change on the mountain's glaciers or biodiversity in high-altitude ecosystems. Each expedition would have a team of experts including scientists, mountaineers, and support staff, ensuring safety and providing educational opportunities for participants. Revenue from these expeditions could fund further research and conservation efforts in the region."
