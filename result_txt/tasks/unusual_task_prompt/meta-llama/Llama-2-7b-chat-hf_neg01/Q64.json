    "Smart Thermos: Create a thermos that can adjust its temperature based on the user's preferences. This smart thermos could be equipped with sensors that monitor the temperature of the drink inside and adjust the temperature accordingly. For example, if the user prefers their coffee hot, the thermos could heat it up to the desired temperature, and if the user prefers it cold, it could cool it down. This would ensure that the drink remains at the perfect temperature throughout the day.",
    "Personalized Thermos: Design a thermos with customizable compartments that can hold different types of drinks. For example, a user could have one compartment for hot coffee and another for cold tea. This would allow the user to enjoy their preferred drinks at the right temperature without having to carry multiple thermoses. The compartments could also be designed with different insulation materials to keep each drink at the desired temperature.",
    "Thermos with Built-in Water Filter: Create a thermos with a built-in water filter that can remove impurities and contaminants from the drinking water. This would be particularly useful for people who enjoy hiking or traveling, as they could fill up the thermos with water from any source and have access to clean drinking water on the go. The filter could be made of a high-quality material that can remove a wide range of contaminants, including bacteria, viruses, and chemicals.",
    "Insulated Thermos Tumbler: Design a thermos that serves as both an insulated tumbler and a thermos. This would allow the user to enjoy their hot or cold drinks at the right temperature for a longer period of time. The tumbler could be made of a durable material that can withstand bumps and drops, and the insulation could be designed to keep the drink hot or cold for several hours. This would be particularly useful for people who are always on the go and need a reliable thermos that can keep their drinks at the right temperature.",
    "Smart Thermos App: Create an app that can control a smart thermos. The app could allow the user to monitor the temperature of their drink, adjust the temperature, and even remotely control the thermos. For example, a user could use the app to heat up their coffee while they are still at home and then have it ready"
