    "A Solar System with a Binary Star: Design a solar system with a binary star system, where two stars orbit each other. This would create a more diverse range of temperatures and atmospheric conditions, offering opportunities for the development of unique life forms and ecosystems.",
    "A Solar System with Floating Cities: Develop a solar system with cities built on the surfaces of comets or asteroids, creating floating cities that could move between the planets. This would allow for a more fluid and dynamic interplanetary travel experience.",
    "A Solar System with Gravity Waves: Create a solar system where the planets and moons have a unique gravitational relationship that generates continuous waves of gravitational energy. This energy could be harnessed for propulsion and other purposes, providing a new source of power.",
    "A Solar System with Multiple Suns: Design a solar system with multiple suns, each with its own planets and moons. This would create a more complex and diverse cosmic environment, with varying levels of solar radiation and temperature.",
    "A Solar System with Inverse Gravity: Develop a solar system with planets that have inverse gravity, where objects are attracted to the center of the planet rather than the surface. This would create unique architectural and engineering challenges, as well as opportunities for new types of transportation and energy generation."
