    "**Noise-Reducing Sleep Mask with Ear Plugs**: Design a sleep mask that not only blocks light but also has built-in ear plugs to reduce noise. The ear plugs would be integrated into the soft fabric of the mask, providing a comfortable, one-size-fits-most solution for better sleep in noisy environments. The mask could have adjustable straps for a snug fit, ensuring the ear plugs stay in place throughout the night.",
    "**Personalized Ear Plug Set with Sound Filters**: Create a set of ear plugs where users can choose different sound filters (white noise, pink noise, brown noise, etc.) based on their preference or the specific environment they're in. Each filter can be programmed to reduce certain frequencies more effectively than others, making it easier for people to block out unwanted sounds while still being able to hear essential noises like alarms or safety signals.",
    "**Ergonomic Ear Plug System for Long-Haul Travelers**: Develop an ear plug system designed specifically for long flights or car rides. This system might include ear plugs that are custom-molded to the user's ear shape for maximum comfort and effectiveness. Additionally, it could feature a timer or a smart device integration so that the ear plugs automatically remove themselves after a specified period, preventing any potential health risks from prolonged use.",
    "**Ear Plug and Headphone Combination for Music Lovers**: Design a hybrid product that combines the functionality of ear plugs with a high-quality noise-cancelling headphone. This product would allow users to enjoy music or listen to podcasts without the need for additional devices. It could also come with a feature that allows users to switch between active noise cancellation and passive ear plug mode, depending on their preference or the situation.",
    "**Smart Ear Plugs with Health Monitoring**: Integrate sensors into the ear plugs that can monitor heart rate, blood oxygen levels, and other vital signs. These ear plugs could then transmit this data wirelessly to a smartphone app, allowing users to track their health during sleep or in noisy environments. This could be particularly useful for individuals who have trouble sleeping due to noise or those with chronic health conditions that require monitoring. "
