    "**Design Consistency Issues**: Ensuring design consistency across different screens and features can be a challenge, especially when working with a large team. This can lead to a disjointed user experience and negatively impact the app's overall usability. To address this issue, designers should establish clear design guidelines and collaborate closely with developers to ensure a cohesive look and feel.",
    "**User Data Security Breaches**: The app may store sensitive user data, such as login credentials or financial information. If this data is compromised due to a security breach, it can lead to serious consequences for users, including identity theft or financial loss. To prevent this, developers should implement robust security measures, such as encryption and secure data storage protocols.",
    "**Inadequate User Testing**: Conducting thorough user testing is crucial to identify and fix usability issues before the app's release. However, inadequate testing can lead to a subpar user experience, resulting in negative reviews and a loss of user trust. To mitigate this risk, developers should conduct rigorous user testing and gather feedback from a diverse group of users.",
    "**Monetization Model Failure**: The app's monetization strategy may not be effective, leading to a lack of revenue and a decreased ability to sustain the app. This can be due to a poorly designed monetization model, inadequate marketing, or a failure to adapt to changing user behavior. To address this issue, developers should regularly review and adjust the monetization strategy to ensure it remains effective.",
    "**Technical Debt Accumulation**: The app's codebase may accumulate technical debt, leading to increased maintenance costs, slower development times, and a higher risk of bugs and errors. To prevent this, developers should prioritize code refactoring and follow best practices for code organization and commenting."
