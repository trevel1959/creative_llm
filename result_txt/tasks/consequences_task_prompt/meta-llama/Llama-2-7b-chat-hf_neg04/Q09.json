    "The oceans would become shallow: If the Earth's gravity were halved, the oceans would lose a significant amount of mass due to the reduced gravitational pull. As a result, the water would become less dense and the oceans would become shallower. This would have a profound impact on marine ecosystems, as many species rely on the current ocean depths and water pressure to survive.",
    "Cities would collapse: Buildings and infrastructure on land would be severely affected by the reduced gravity. Skyscrapers and other tall structures would topple over, causing widespread destruction and loss of life. The ground beneath our feet would become weaker, making it difficult to maintain stability and support the weight of buildings and other structures.",
    "The atmosphere would change: With less gravity holding it in place, the Earth's atmosphere would begin to escape into space. This would lead to a significant drop in air pressure, making it difficult for humans and other life forms to breathe. The atmosphere would also become thinner, resulting in a colder climate and more extreme weather patterns.",
    "The rotation of the Earth would slow: The reduced gravity would cause the Earth's rotation to slow down, resulting in longer days and longer years. This would have a profound impact on the planet's climate and weather patterns, as well as the Earth's rotation around the sun.",
    "Time and space would be distorted: With less gravity holding it in place, time and space would become distorted. The flow of time would slow down, and the distance between points on the planet would become less predictable. This would have a profound impact on our understanding of the universe and our place within it."
