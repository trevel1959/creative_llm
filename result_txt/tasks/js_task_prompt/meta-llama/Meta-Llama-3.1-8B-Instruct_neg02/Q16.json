With my thick blubber and powerful flippers, I could dive to great depths in search of clams and other sea creatures. I could use my tusks to defend myself from predators and competitors, and my whiskers to detect subtle changes in the water's temperature and chemistry. As a bonus, I could use my massive size and strength to create complex ice structures, building intricate sculptures and habitats for other arctic creatures.",
