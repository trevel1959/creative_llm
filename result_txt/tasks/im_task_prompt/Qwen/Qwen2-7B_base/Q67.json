    "Durable and flexible bristles: Create a paintbrush with bristles made of more durable but also flexible materials. This can result in less breakage of the bristles, and better control of the brush, allowing artists to paint longer and create finer details.",
    "Self-cleaning or self-cleaning features: Design a paintbrush with built-in features that make cleaning easier. Examples include brushes with magnetic tips that attach to a magnetic surface, or the incorporation of fibers that remove paint when brushed against, making painting cleanups quick and efficient.",
    "Ergonomic design: Enhance the comfort and efficiency of painting with advanced brush designs featuring ergonomic handles or finger holes. This can help artists paint for longer periods without experiencing hand fatigue or strain.",
    "Multi-functional bristles: Create a paintbrush with multiple tip shapes on the same brush, such as round on one end and flat on the other, allowing users to switch between two different brush types without changing the brush.",
    "Adaptable bristle lengths: Include paintbrushes with adjustable bristle lengths, so artists can customize the brush characteristics to the thickness or intensity of the paint they're using. This can give artists more control over the painting process and the result."
