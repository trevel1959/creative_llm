    "**Hydrogen Fuel Cells**: In a world without oil, hydrogen fuel cells could become the primary power source for vehicles. These cells convert hydrogen gas into electricity, with water as the only byproduct. Infrastructure could be developed to extract hydrogen from water using renewable energy sources like wind and solar. Hydrogen stations could replace gas stations, allowing vehicles to refuel quickly and efficiently, while also significantly reducing greenhouse gas emissions.",
    "**Biofuel Innovations**: We could harness organic waste to create biofuels through advanced fermentation and chemical processes. Vehicles could run on biofuels derived from food waste, agricultural residues, or even algae. This approach not only provides a sustainable fuel source but also addresses waste management issues, turning potential pollutants into valuable energy resources.",
    "**Magnetic Levitation (Maglev) Vehicles**: Vehicles could be reimagined to use magnetic levitation technology for propulsion. By utilizing superconductors and magnetic fields, these vehicles would hover above the ground and be propelled forward without friction. This method could be powered by renewable energy sources and drastically reduce energy consumption, while also enabling faster and smoother travel.",
    "**Kinetic Energy Recovery Systems (KERS)**: Vehicles could be equipped with advanced KERS that capture energy generated during braking or deceleration. This energy could be stored in batteries or supercapacitors and reused to power the vehicle. By integrating this technology into public transportation systems, like buses and trains, cities could significantly reduce energy consumption and enhance efficiency.",
    "**Electric Vehicle Swapping Stations**: Instead of traditional refueling, vehicles could be designed for quick battery swaps at designated stations. Drivers would simply exchange their depleted batteries for fully charged ones, allowing for minimal downtime. This model would encourage the use of electric vehicles, as drivers would not have to worry about long charging times, and battery manufacturers could focus on developing high-capacity, fast-charging batteries."
