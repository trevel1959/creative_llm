    "**Adjustable Weight System**: Create a bowling ball with a customizable weight feature. This could be achieved through a series of interchangeable weights that can be added or removed from the ball's core. This allows bowlers to adjust the ball's weight based on their strength, technique, and the lane conditions, helping them develop their skills more effectively.",
    "**Ergonomic Grip Technology**: Develop a bowling ball with an innovative grip design that molds to the user's hand. This could include a soft, flexible material that conforms to the fingers and palm, providing better control and reducing strain during play. Additionally, the grip could have adjustable finger holes that allow bowlers to modify their grip without needing to purchase a new ball.",
    "**Color-Changing Surface**: Introduce a bowling ball with a color-changing surface that reacts to the temperature of the ball. This could serve as a visual cue for bowlers, indicating when the ball has warmed up sufficiently after being in storage or when itâ€™s time to cool down the ball during play. This feature can help maintain optimal performance and prolong the life of the ball.",
    "**Bowling Ball Care Kit**: Develop a comprehensive care kit specifically designed for bowling balls. This kit could include a cleaning solution, microfiber cloth, a specialized polishing tool, and a storage bag that maintains optimal conditions for the ball. The kit could also come with instructional materials on how to care for the ball, ensuring it performs at its best for longer.",
    "**Interactive Training Bowling Ball**: Create a bowling ball that includes interactive training features such as LED lights and audio feedback. The ball could light up different colors based on the bowler's technique, such as green for a perfect release and red for a poor one. Additionally, it could emit sounds to guide the bowler through the process, making practice sessions more engaging and educational."
