    "**Smart Iron with Built-in Wi-Fi and Voice Assistant Integration**: Design a clothes iron with Wi-Fi connectivity and integration with popular voice assistants like Alexa or Google Assistant. This allows users to schedule ironing sessions, receive notifications when their clothes are ready, and even control the iron remotely using voice commands. The iron could also be equipped with a built-in thermometer to ensure the optimal temperature for different fabrics.",
    "**Eco-Friendly Iron with Reusable Steam Generator**: Develop an iron that uses a reusable steam generator, eliminating the need for disposable steam cartridges. This design would reduce waste and make the iron more environmentally friendly. The reusable generator could be made from a durable, food-grade material and be easily cleaned and refilled.",
    "**Portable Iron with Built-in Travel Bag and Power Bank**: Create a compact, portable iron that comes with a built-in travel bag and a power bank to keep devices charged on the go. This would be perfect for travelers who need to iron clothes quickly and efficiently in their hotel room or while on a business trip. The iron could also be designed with a retractable cord and a compact footprint to save space.",
    "**Iron with Integrated Fabric Stretcher and Shrinkage Preventer**: Design an iron with an integrated fabric stretcher and shrinkage preventer. The fabric stretcher would help to relax wrinkles and creases, while the shrinkage preventer would use a specialized coating to prevent fabrics from shrinking or losing their shape during the ironing process. This would be particularly useful for delicate or special-care fabrics.",
    "**Iron with Built-in Sanitizing UV Light**: Develop an iron with a built-in sanitizing UV light that kills bacteria and other microorganisms on fabrics. This would be especially useful for households with pets or allergies, as it would help to reduce the risk of spreading germs and allergens through clothing. The UV light could be set to different intensity levels and timed to sanitize specific areas of the fabric."
