    "**Life Support Systems**: A spaceship must be equipped with reliable life support systems that provide oxygen, remove carbon dioxide, and maintain a stable temperature and pressure. Designing these systems involves integrating technologies for water recycling, food storage, and waste management. Any failure in these systems could lead to catastrophic consequences for the crew, necessitating robust redundancy and emergency protocols.",
    "**Navigation and Communication**: Ensuring accurate navigation and reliable communication with Earth is critical for mission success. The spaceship needs advanced onboard navigation systems that can operate autonomously in deep space, where GPS signals are unavailable. Additionally, communication systems must be capable of transmitting data over vast distances with minimal delay, requiring innovative solutions to overcome signal degradation and interference.",
    "**Propulsion System Efficiency**: The choice of propulsion system is vital for mission feasibility. Designers must consider options like chemical rockets, ion thrusters, or nuclear propulsion, each with distinct advantages and challenges. Efficiency, thrust-to-weight ratio, and fuel availability must be evaluated to ensure the spacecraft can reach its destination within a reasonable timeframe while minimizing fuel costs and mass.",
    "**Crew Safety and Comfort**: The psychological and physical well-being of the crew during long-duration missions is a significant concern. The design must incorporate ergonomic interiors, recreational areas, and systems for psychological support. Potential issues include cabin fever, stress, and the impact of microgravity on health, necessitating a focus on both safety protocols and comfort features in the living quarters.",
    "**Launch and Re-entry Dynamics**: The spaceship must be designed to withstand the extreme forces of launch and re-entry. This includes structural integrity under acceleration and thermal protection systems to handle the intense heat generated during re-entry into the Earth's atmosphere. Engineers must simulate these conditions to ensure that the design can endure without compromising the safety of the crew and the spacecraft."
