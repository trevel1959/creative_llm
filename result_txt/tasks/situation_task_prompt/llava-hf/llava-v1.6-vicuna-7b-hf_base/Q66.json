    "Another option would be to use prefabricated components made from natural materials, such as bamboo or reclaimed wood, and assemble them on-site. This would allow us to use natural materials while still benefiting from the efficiency and precision of modern manufacturing.",
    "We could also use a combination of natural and non-natural materials, such as using a steel frame with a wooden facade or stone accents. This would allow us to take advantage of the strength and durability of non-natural materials while still incorporating the beauty and warmth of natural materials.",
    "Another option would be to use biodegradable or sustainable materials, such as bamboo or reclaimed wood, and design the house in a way that allows for easy replacement or recycling of these materials when they are no longer needed.",
    "We could also use 3D printing technology to create custom, on-site housing solutions. This would allow us to design and build houses quickly and efficiently, using a wide variety of materials and configurations.",
    "Another option would be to use a modular design approach, where prefabricated components are assembled on-site to create a customized, energy-efficient house. This would allow us to take advantage of the efficiency and precision of modern manufacturing while still creating a unique and personalized living space."
