    "**Smart Traffic Management System Integration**: Develop a self-driving car system that integrates seamlessly with existing traffic management systems. This would allow the vehicle to predict and adapt to real-time traffic conditions, such as accidents or road closures, using AI algorithms. The car could automatically reroute itself to avoid congestion, reducing travel time and improving overall traffic flow.",
    "**Autonomous Ride-Sharing Service**: Create a ride-sharing service that exclusively uses self-driving cars. By leveraging advanced algorithms for route optimization and demand forecasting, this service could offer more efficient and affordable transportation options compared to traditional ride-hailing services. Additionally, integrating the service with public transportation networks could provide seamless travel experiences for users.",
    "**Environmental Monitoring and Cleanup**: Equip self-driving cars with sensors and equipment capable of detecting and collecting litter from roads and sidewalks. These vehicles could be deployed regularly to maintain cleaner urban environments while autonomously navigating and avoiding obstacles. The collected waste could be transported to recycling facilities or disposal sites, contributing to environmental conservation efforts.",
    "**Accessible Mobility Solutions**: Design self-driving cars specifically tailored for individuals with disabilities, incorporating features like automatic wheelchair access, speech recognition for commands, and adaptive seating arrangements. This would enhance accessibility to transportation, allowing people with disabilities to travel independently and participate more fully in society.",
    "**Augmented Reality Navigation**: Enhance the navigation experience for self-driving cars by integrating augmented reality technology. The car's windshield or heads-up display could project 3D maps, lane guidance, and real-time traffic updates onto the road ahead, providing drivers with an immersive and safer driving experience. This technology could also offer personalized information, such as local points of interest or upcoming events along the route."
