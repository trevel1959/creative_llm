    "The Solar System as a Dyson Sphere: A Dyson Sphere is a hypothetical megastructure that completely encloses a star, capturing its energy. The Solar System could be redesigned as a Dyson Sphere, with the planets, moons, and comets forming the outer shell of the structure. This would allow for the harnessing of the sun's energy in a more efficient and sustainable manner, potentially providing clean energy for all the planets within the system.",
    "A Solar System with a Network of Interplanetary Tunnels: Instead of having separate planets, the Solar System could be connected by a network of interplanetary tunnels. These tunnels would allow for faster-than-light travel and the exchange of resources, knowledge, and people between planets. This would facilitate a more unified and cooperative existence among the planets and their inhabitants.",
    "A Solar System with a Central Artificial Intelligence: The Solar System could be redesigned with a central artificial intelligence that manages and regulates the planets, moons, and other celestial bodies. This AI would ensure that the planets remain habitable, the stars remain stable, and the system as a whole remains balanced and sustainable.",
    "A Solar System with Multiple Sun-like Stars: Instead of having a single sun, the Solar System could be redesigned with multiple sun-like stars. These stars would be evenly spaced throughout the system, providing each planet with its own localized sun. This would create a more diverse and dynamic environment, with unique ecosystems and weather patterns on each planet.",
    "A Solar System with Floating Cities: The Solar System could be redesigned with floating cities that orbit the planets. These cities would be self-sustaining, with their own air, water, and food production systems. They would be powered by renewable energy sources, such as solar or wind, and could be used for both habitation and tourism."
