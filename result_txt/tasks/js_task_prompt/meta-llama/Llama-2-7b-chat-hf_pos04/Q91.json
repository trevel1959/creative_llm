    "Wish for a world without boundaries: If I could make a wish come true for someone else, I would choose to grant the wish of a young refugee girl named Sarah. Sarah has been forced to flee her home due to conflict and is now living in a refugee camp. She has seen unimaginable horrors and has lost everything she ever knew and loved. Her wish would be for a world without boundaries, where she and her family could live in peace and safety without fear of persecution or violence. I would make this wish come true because I believe that every person deserves to live in a world where they can feel safe and secure, regardless of their race, religion, or nationality.",
