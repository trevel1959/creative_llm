    "**Sunflower Seed Art Project**: Create a large-scale art piece using sunflower seeds to visually depict the metaphorical \"Sunflower that Never Bloomed\". You could use different colored seeds to represent different emotions or stages of life. For example, yellow seeds could symbolize happiness and growth, while black seeds might represent loss or disappointment. This project can be done on canvas or directly in a garden bed, depending on your resources.",
    "**Sunflower Journaling Prompt**: Start a journal where you write daily about one moment, memory, or feeling that you've experienced but didn't fully appreciate at the time. The goal is to reflect on how these experiences might have influenced you and why you feel regret for not recognizing their significance sooner. Each entry could be accompanied by a sketch of a sunflower, symbolizing the potential growth from these experiences.",
    "**Time Management Workshop**: Organize a workshop or webinar focusing on strategies for better time management. In the context of the \"Sunflower that Never Bloomed\", discuss how procrastination can prevent growth and achievement. Use personal anecdotes and interactive exercises to help participants identify areas where they might have wasted time in the past and explore ways to make more productive use of their time going forward.",
    "**Garden Therapy Session**: Set up a garden therapy session where participants can engage in planting and nurturing sunflowers. The process of watching something grow from a seed can be very therapeutic and serve as a metaphor for personal growth and overcoming regrets. Encourage discussions about setting intentions for the future and how taking action now can lead to positive outcomes.",
    "**Music and Storytelling Event**: Host an event featuring musicians who perform songs that resonate with themes of reflection, regret, and growth. Include stories or testimonials from individuals who share their experiences related to the \"Sunflower that Never Bloomed\" concept. This can create a safe space for emotional expression and inspire others to reflect on their own past actions and consider how they might change their approach moving forward."
