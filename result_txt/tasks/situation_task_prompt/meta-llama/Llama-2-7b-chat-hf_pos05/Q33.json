    "Sun Clocks: Since the sun rises and sets at a consistent time every day, people could use the position of the sun to tell time. They could create a sundial, a device that tracks the sun's shadow, to measure time. This would be a simple and natural way to keep track of time without relying on clocks or watches.",
    "Shadow Sticks: Similar to sundials, people could use shadow sticks to measure time. These sticks would be placed upright in the ground, and their shadows would be used to indicate the time of day. As the sun moves across the sky, the shadow of the stick would change, allowing people to tell the time.",
    "Water Clocks: Ancient civilizations used water clocks, also known as clepsydras, to measure time. These clocks use the flow of water to measure time, and they are still used today in some parts of the world. In a world without clocks or watches, people could use water clocks to keep track of time.",
    "Sand Timers: Sand timers are another ancient time-measuring device that could be used in a world without clocks or watches. These devices use the flow of sand to measure time, and they are simple to use and maintain. People could use sand timers to measure the passage of time for various activities, such as cooking or working.",
    "Time Stones: In a world without clocks or watches, people could use time stones to keep track of time. Time stones are small rocks or crystals that have been treated to change color at specific times of the day. For example, a time stone could change color from blue to red at sunrise, indicating the start of a new day. People could use these stones to measure the passage of time and keep track of their schedules."
