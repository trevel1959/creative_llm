    "Bicycle-themed Art Installation: Create a large-scale art installation that takes the form of a bicycle. The installation could be made of recycled materials, such as old bicycle parts, and could be displayed in a public space, such as a park or plaza. The installation could also include interactive elements, such as a \"pedal\" station where visitors can pedal and generate energy to power a nearby light source.",
    "Bicycle-themed Cafe: Open a cafe that incorporates bicycles into the decor and menu. The cafe could feature bicycle-themed decor, such as vintage bicycle frames turned into light fixtures or bicycle-printed wallpaper. The menu could include bicycle-inspired dishes, such as \"Chain Reaction\" sandwiches (made with chicken or tofu) and \"Gear Grinders\" (a coffee drink made with espresso and grinds).",
    "Bicycle-themed Board Game: Design a board game that incorporates bicycles as the main mode of transportation. Players could take on the role of cyclists competing in a race across a variety of terrain, including hills, valleys, and cities. The game could include different types of bicycles, each with its own unique abilities and strengths, and players could collect \"energy\" points by completing laps and challenges.",
    "Bicycle-themed Music Festival: Host a music festival that celebrates the bicycle culture. The festival could feature bands and musicians who are also avid cyclists, and the stage could be designed to resemble a bicycle wheel. Food and drink vendors could offer bicycle-themed treats, such as \"Pedal Pops\" (frozen treats on a stick) and \"Chain Links\" (beer or wine served in a chain-shaped glass).",
    "Bicycle-themed Educational Program: Develop an educational program that teaches children about the benefits of cycling and the importance of bicycle safety. The program could include interactive activities, such as a \"Bicycle Safety Scavenger Hunt\" or a \"Build-a-Bicycle\" workshop, and could be offered at local schools or community centers"
