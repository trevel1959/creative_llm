    "**Tennis Ball Pong Game**: Create a new variation of the classic game Beer Pong using tennis balls instead of ping pong balls. The game can be played on a larger scale or with a twist like using cups of different sizes or types (e.g., wine glasses, flower pots). This not only changes up the standard game but also adds a unique twist to the experience.",
    "**Tennis Ball Decorative Lamp**: Use tennis balls as the primary material for making a decorative lamp. Each ball can be painted in different colors or patterns, then glued onto a wire frame to create a visually appealing light fixture. The tennis balls provide a soft glow when lit, adding a unique texture and aesthetic to any room.",
    "**Tennis Ball Pet Bed**: Design a pet bed using tennis balls as the foundation for the cushion. By stuffing the balls with soft materials like fleece or cotton, the pet bed will be both comfortable and durable. The tennis balls give the bed a playful and unique appearance, making it an attractive addition to a pet owner's home.",
    "**Tennis Ball Garden Furniture**: Create garden furniture such as benches, chairs, or tables by using tennis balls as the base for the feet or as decorative elements on top of the furniture. This can be achieved by gluing tennis balls to the legs of the furniture or by creating a pattern with them on the surface. The tennis balls add a whimsical touch to outdoor living spaces.",
    "**Tennis Ball Art Installation**: Combine tennis balls with other materials to create a large-scale art installation. For example, you could use strings to hang tennis balls from a ceiling, creating a three-dimensional pattern that changes as people move around the space. Alternatively, arrange tennis balls in a specific geometric pattern on a wall or floor, which can be interactive and change depending on the viewer's perspective. This type of installation can serve as a focal point in public spaces or galleries."
