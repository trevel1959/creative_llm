    "Hydrogen Fuel Cells: Another option would be to use hydrogen fuel cells to power vehicles. This would involve using hydrogen fuel cells to generate electricity, which would then be used to power the vehicle's engines. This would be a clean and efficient solution, as it would produce only water as a byproduct.",
    "Electric Vehicles: Another option would be to switch to electric vehicles, which are powered by batteries that can be charged using electricity from the grid. This would involve developing more efficient batteries and charging infrastructure to support this transition.",
    "Biofuels: Another option would be to use biofuels, such as ethanol or biodiesel, to power vehicles. This would involve producing these fuels from organic materials, such as corn or soybeans, which could be grown and harvested sustainably.",
    "Geothermal Energy: Another option would be to use geothermal energy to power vehicles. This would involve tapping into the heat generated by the Earth's core to generate electricity, which could then be used to power vehicles.",
    "Wind Energy: Another option would be to use wind energy to power vehicles. This would involve installing wind turbines on vehicles, which would convert wind energy into electricity to power the vehicle's engines."
