    "**Coconut Water Purification System**: Create a makeshift still using a shell and a piece of bark to purify coconut water, making it safe to drink. This system would involve placing the shell in a hole, pouring coconut water into the shell, and then collecting the distilled water that drips out. This would provide a reliable source of clean drinking water.",
    "**Fish Trap Design**: Craft a fish trap using materials like vines, sticks, and rocks to catch fish in the nearby waters. The trap would consist of a funnel-shaped entrance that leads to a small enclosure, allowing the fish to swim in but not out. This would provide a steady supply of protein-rich food.",
    "**Solar Still**: Build a solar still using a container, a rock, and a clear plastic sheet to collect water from the sand. By placing the container in a shallow hole, covering it with a clear plastic sheet, and weighing down the center with a rock, the sun's heat would evaporate the water from the sand, which would then condense on the underside of the plastic sheet, allowing for the collection of clean drinking water.",
    "**Shelter Construction**: Construct a sturdy shelter using palm fronds, branches, and other island materials. The shelter would provide protection from the elements, wildlife, and harsh weather conditions. By creating a sloping roof and using natural materials, the shelter would be both functional and aesthetically pleasing.",
    "**Fire Starting Method**: Develop a method to start a fire using a piece of glass, a rock, and some dry leaves. By focusing the sun's rays through the glass onto a small area, generating intense heat, and then using the hot rock to ignite the dry leaves, a fire could be started, providing warmth, light, and a means to cook food. This method would also serve as a backup in case other fire-starting methods fail. [/INST] "
