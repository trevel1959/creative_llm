    "**Innovative Tracking System**: Create a luggage tag that includes an embedded NFC (Near Field Communication) chip or Bluetooth beacon. This allows for real-time tracking of your luggage on your smartphone or smartwatch. When you're at the airport, you can use your device to see where your luggage is in the system, potentially even getting alerts when it's loaded onto your flight and delivered at your destination.",
    "**Customizable Luggage Tags**: Offer a range of customization options such as engraving, printing designs, stickers, or even a small digital display. This not only helps in making the luggage more unique but also serves as a creative way to personalize your luggage, making it easily recognizable amidst similar items.",
    "**Sustainable Materials**: Use eco-friendly materials for the creation of luggage tags. For instance, recycled plastic, natural fibers, or biodegradable plastics could be used. This aligns with growing consumer trends towards sustainable products and offers a green solution to luggage tagging.",
    "**Smart Lock Integration**: Integrate smart locks into the luggage tag. The user can lock their luggage using a smartphone app, which sends notifications if the luggage is opened without authorization. This provides an additional layer of security and peace of mind.",
    "**Interactive Luggage Tag**: Develop a tag that includes a QR code leading to a website or social media platform. Users can share their travel experiences, photos, or stories related to their trips directly from their luggage tag. This not only adds a personal touch but also encourages engagement and interaction between travelers, creating a community around shared travel experiences."
