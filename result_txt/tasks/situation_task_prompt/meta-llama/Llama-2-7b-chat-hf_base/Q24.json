    "Artificial Vision Aids: People with poor vision could use artificial vision aids such as telescopes or binoculars to enhance their visual capabilities. These aids could be worn like glasses or contact lenses, and could be designed to amplify or change the light entering the eye, providing a more detailed view of the surroundings.",
    "Brain-Computer Interfaces: Another option would be to use brain-computer interfaces (BCIs) that can read brain signals and translate them into visual information. People could use BCIs to \"see\" their surroundings by decoding the visual information from their brain signals. This technology is already being developed and has been used to restore vision in some individuals.",
    "Advanced Hearing Aids: With the disappearance of glasses and contact lenses, people with poor vision could rely more heavily on their other senses, such as hearing. Advanced hearing aids could be developed that can enhance the wearer's ability to hear and interpret sounds, allowing them to navigate and interact with their environment more effectively.",
    "Smart Clothing and Accessories: Smart clothing and accessories could be designed to provide visual cues to people with poor vision. For example, clothing with built-in sensors could detect and alert the wearer to obstacles or changes in their surroundings, while smart glasses could display augmented reality information to help them navigate."
