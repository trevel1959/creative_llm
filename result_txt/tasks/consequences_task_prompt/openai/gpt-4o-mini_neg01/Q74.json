    "**Urban Overload**: With the entire world condensed into one city, the strain on infrastructure would be immense. Transportation systems, healthcare, and utilities would be overwhelmed by the sheer volume of people. This could lead to severe traffic congestion, inadequate healthcare access, and power shortages. Urban planners would need to innovate rapidly to accommodate the growing population, potentially leading to the development of smart cities with advanced technology to manage resources efficiently.",
    "**Economic Disparities**: The merging of all economies into one urban center could exacerbate wealth inequality. While some areas may flourish due to concentrated resources and talent, others may suffer from neglect. The economic divide could lead to social unrest and crime, as marginalized groups struggle to survive in a city that may not cater to their needs. Policymakers would need to implement social programs and equitable resource distribution to prevent societal fractures.",
    "**Environmental Impact**: A single city would drastically alter the environment, leading to increased pollution, deforestation, and loss of biodiversity. The concentration of human activity would heighten the urban heat island effect, making the city hotter than surrounding areas. To combat these issues, innovative green architecture and sustainable practices would be essential, such as vertical gardens, renewable energy sources, and urban rewilding projects that reintroduce nature into the cityscape.",
    "**Governance Challenges**: Managing a single global city would pose significant governance challenges. A centralized government might struggle to represent the diverse needs and opinions of its citizens. This could lead to calls for local governance structures or autonomous regions within the city. The need for transparent and inclusive decision-making processes would be paramount to ensure all voices are heard and to maintain social cohesion.",
    "**Psychological Effects**: Living in a densely populated urban environment could have profound psychological effects on individuals. While some may thrive in the vibrancy of city life, others might experience feelings of isolation, anxiety, or overwhelm due to the constant stimulation and lack of personal space. Mental health services would need to adapt to these challenges, providing accessible support systems and promoting community-building initiatives to foster connections among residents."
