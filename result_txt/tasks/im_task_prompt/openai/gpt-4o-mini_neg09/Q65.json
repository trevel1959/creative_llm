    "**Self-Cleaning Mechanism**: Introduce a self-cleaning feature using ultrasonic waves or a steam cleaning function that can break down limescale and other residues. This would make maintenance easier and ensure the kettle remains in optimal condition without the need for manual scrubbing or descaling agents.",
    "**Multi-Functional Lid**: Design a lid that doubles as a measuring cup and a tea infuser. The lid could have measurement markings on the inside and a compartment for loose leaf tea or herbal infusions. This way, users can brew their tea directly in the kettle without needing a separate teapot or infuser.",
    "**Portable and Rechargeable Design**: Create a portable electric kettle with a rechargeable battery, allowing users to boil water without needing to be near a power outlet. This would be ideal for camping trips, picnics, or traveling, making it easy to enjoy hot beverages anywhere.",
    "**Interactive LED Display**: Implement an interactive LED display that shows real-time water temperature, boil time, and customizable countdown timers. Users could select different modes for brewing various beverages, and the display could also provide tips or recipes for different drinks, making the kettle more engaging.",
    "**Voice Activation and Smart Assistant Integration**: Incorporate voice activation capabilities and compatibility with smart home assistants like Amazon Alexa or Google Assistant. Users could simply say, “Boil water for tea,” and the kettle would respond accordingly, making it easier to use when hands are full or when multitasking."
