    "Create a smart lightbulb that can detect and adjust its brightness based on the user's mood. The lightbulb will use machine learning algorithms to analyze the user's facial expressions and body language to determine their emotional state. The lightbulb will also have a voice assistant integrated, allowing users to give voice commands to control the lighting in their home. Confidence Score: 0.8",
    "Develop a lightbulb that can generate a soothing, white noise sound when turned on. The lightbulb will use a small speaker to produce the noise, which can help to mask background noise and create a more peaceful environment. The lightbulb will also have a built-in timer, allowing users to set the lightbulb to turn off after a set amount of time. Confidence Score: 0.7",
    "Create a lightbulb that can change color based on the time of day. The lightbulb will use a special LED chip that can produce a range of colors, including blue for morning, yellow for midday, and red for evening. The lightbulb will also have a built-in sensor that can detect the time of day and adjust the color of the light accordingly. Confidence Score: 0.8",
    "Develop a lightbulb that can be controlled using hand gestures. The lightbulb will use a camera and machine learning algorithms to detect and recognize hand gestures, allowing users to turn the light on and off, adjust the brightness, and change the color of the light without touching the bulb. Confidence Score: 0.9",
    "Create a lightbulb that can generate a holographic image when turned on. The lightbulb will use a special LED chip that can project a 3D image, creating the illusion of a hologram. The hologram can be set to display a variety of images, including photos, videos, and even 3D models. Confidence Score: 0.9"
