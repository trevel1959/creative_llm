    "**Bicycle-Shaped Space Station**: Design a space station in the shape of a giant bicycle, complete with a wheel-shaped solar panel array and a handlebar control system. The space station would serve as a hub for space exploration, with astronauts living and working in the \"frame\" of the bicycle. The wheel-shaped solar panels would provide power, while the handlebars would control the station's movement and orientation. This design would not only be a unique and recognizable landmark in space but also serve as a symbol of innovation and progress.",
    "**Smart Bike Helmet**: Develop a smart bike helmet that includes advanced safety features, such as collision detection, lane departure warning, and blind spot monitoring. The helmet would also have a built-in GPS, allowing riders to track their routes and receive real-time traffic updates. Additionally, the helmet could include a wearable device that tracks the rider's vital signs, such as heart rate and blood pressure, providing valuable insights for improving fitness and health.",
    "**Eco-Friendly Bike-Sharing System**: Create a bike-sharing system that uses electric bicycles powered by renewable energy sources, such as solar panels or wind turbines. The system would be designed to reduce carbon emissions and promote sustainable transportation in urban areas. Riders could access the bicycles through a mobile app, and the system would be integrated with public transportation, making it easy to get around the city without a car.",
    "**Bicycle-Based Water Purification System**: Design a bicycle-powered water purification system that uses a pedal-powered generator to power a water filtration system. The system would be ideal for use in developing communities or disaster relief situations, where access to clean drinking water is limited. The bicycle would be used to generate power, which would then be used to purify water, providing a reliable source of clean drinking water.",
    "**Virtual Reality Bike Experience**: Develop a virtual reality bike experience that allows riders to explore new and exciting destinations from the comfort of their own homes. The system would use a specialized bike and VR headset to transport riders to virtual environments, such as scenic bike trails or exotic locations. The experience would be designed to promote physical activity and exploration, while also providing a unique and immersive experience."
