    "**Haptic Feedback Cane**: Create a smart cane that uses haptic feedback to alert users to obstacles in their path. The cane would be equipped with ultrasonic sensors to detect objects at various distances and translate that information into vibrations of varying intensity and patterns. For instance, a gentle vibration could indicate a nearby person, while a rapid pattern could signify a larger obstacle. This would allow visually impaired individuals to better gauge their surroundings without relying solely on auditory cues.",
    "**Wearable Smart Assistant**: Design a wearable device, such as a wristband or necklace, that connects to a smartphone app. This device would use voice recognition and natural language processing to provide assistance in real-time. Users could ask questions about their environment, request navigation help, or get descriptions of nearby objects. The device could also feature a \"Find My Way Home\" function that guides users back to a preset location through audio cues, ensuring they can navigate safely and independently.",
    "**Interactive Smart Home System**: Develop an integrated smart home system specifically designed for visually impaired users. This system would utilize voice commands to control lighting, appliances, and security systems. It would also include tactile feedback interfaces, such as Braille labels or raised buttons, to allow users to interact with their home environment easily. Additionally, the system could offer customizable routines, such as automatically turning on lights at sunset or reading the news aloud in the morning.",
    "**Augmented Reality (AR) App for Object Recognition**: Create an AR application that utilizes the camera on a smartphone or tablet to identify and describe objects in the user's environment. The app would use machine learning algorithms to recognize everyday items, such as food products, household objects, or even people, and provide audio descriptions. This would enhance the user's ability to interact with their surroundings and increase their independence, especially in social settings or while shopping.",
    "**Smart Labeling System**: Design a system of smart labels that can be attached to various items around the home or in public spaces. These labels would have built-in NFC or QR codes that can be scanned with a smartphone app. When scanned, the app would read the label aloud, providing information about the item, such as its name, instructions, or nutritional information. This would be particularly useful for visually impaired individuals who need assistance with organizing their belongings or understanding product details."
