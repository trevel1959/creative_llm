    "**Adaptive Fit System**: Create a helmet with an adaptive fit mechanism that uses sensors to measure the cyclist's head shape and size. This helmet would automatically adjust its internal padding and strap tightness for optimal comfort and security. It could also incorporate memory foam that molds to the userâ€™s head over time, ensuring a snug fit that can adapt to different head shapes and sizes.",
    "**Built-in Safety Lights and Indicators**: Integrate LED lights into the helmet that serve as both a rear light and turn signal indicators. Cyclists could activate the lights using a small button on the helmet or through a Bluetooth connection to their smartphone. This would enhance visibility during nighttime rides and provide clearer communication to other road users, reducing the risk of accidents.",
    "**Cooling and Ventilation System**: Design a helmet with an active cooling system that includes small fans or a moisture-wicking lining. This would help regulate temperature and keep the cyclist cool during long rides or in hot weather. The helmet could feature adjustable vents that open or close based on the cyclist's speed and temperature, optimizing airflow for maximum comfort.",
    "**Impact-Absorbing Technology**: Develop a helmet using advanced materials that incorporate non-Newtonian fluids or smart polymers that stiffen upon impact but remain flexible during regular use. This technology would provide superior protection against head injuries while maintaining a lightweight and comfortable design. Additionally, the helmet could have a modular structure, allowing for easy replacement of damaged parts after an accident.",
    "**Eco-Friendly Materials and Design**: Create a bicycle helmet made from sustainable and biodegradable materials, such as recycled plastics or natural fibers. The design could also include a modular construction that allows for easy disassembly and recycling at the end of its life cycle. This approach would appeal to environmentally conscious consumers and reduce the ecological footprint of cycling gear."
