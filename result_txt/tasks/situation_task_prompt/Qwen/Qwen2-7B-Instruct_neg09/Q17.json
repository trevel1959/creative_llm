    "**Developing a Self-Sustaining Garden**: Create a hydroponic garden that uses solar-powered lights to provide light for plant growth during the day. This system can also include a water collection system to collect rainwater for irrigation. Additionally, you can grow plants that are adapted to low-light conditions, such as leafy greens and herbs, which can be used for food. ",
    "**Creating a Manual Water Filtration System**: In the absence of electricity, access to clean drinking water becomes critical. You can build a gravity-fed water filtration system using sand, gravel, and activated charcoal. The sand filters out larger particles, gravel filters out smaller particles, and the activated charcoal removes contaminants and impurities from the water.",
    "**Designing a Solar-Powered Lantern**: Build a lantern using materials you have at hand, like an old glass bottle or jar. Inside, place a small solar panel, a battery, and a light bulb. Charge the battery during the day using the solar panel, and use the stored energy to light up the lantern at night. This can help in providing light for reading, cooking, or other tasks.",
    "**Crafting a Manual Sewing Machine**: Use basic materials like a bicycle wheel, a motorbike chain, and some scrap metal to create a simple sewing machine. The bicycle wheel can serve as the turning mechanism, while the chain can be used to create tension for the needle. This allows you to sew clothes, mend items, or even create makeshift shelters if needed.",
    "**Building a Manual Wood-Burning Stove**: Construct a wood-burning stove that efficiently burns wood to produce heat. The design could involve a combustion chamber where air is channeled through the firewood to ensure complete burning. This stove can be used to cook food, boil water, or keep warm during cold nights. It's important to ensure safety by keeping flammable materials away from the heat source and having a well-ventilated area to prevent carbon monoxide poisoning."
