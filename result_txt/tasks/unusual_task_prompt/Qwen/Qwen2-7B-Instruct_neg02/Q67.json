    "**Innovative Flashlight Design for Emergency Situations**: Develop a flashlight that incorporates solar panels to recharge its battery during daylight hours. It can also have a built-in whistle to alert rescuers if needed, and a magnifying lens for reading maps or signs in low light conditions. The flashlight could be designed to float in water, making it useful for aquatic emergencies.",
    "**Interactive Flashlight as a Teaching Tool**: Create an educational device that uses flashlights to teach children about light, colors, shadows, and basic optics. The flashlight could come with various filters that change the color of the light, helping kids understand how different wavelengths interact with materials. It might include interactive games where children point the flashlight at different objects to see how light affects them, enhancing their learning experience.",
    "**Portable Flashlight as a Personal Security Device**: Design a compact, rechargeable flashlight with features such as a hidden USB port for charging electronic devices, a personal alarm button, and a seatbelt cutter for emergency escape situations. This flashlight could be easily carried in a purse or pocket, providing both utility and safety benefits.",
    "**Therapeutic Flashlight for Sleep Disorders**: Develop a flashlight that emits specific wavelengths of light (blue and red) to help regulate sleep patterns. This could be particularly beneficial for people suffering from insomnia or jet lag. The flashlight would be designed to be used before bedtime to help signal to the body that it's time to wind down and prepare for sleep.",
    "**Smart Flashlight for Outdoor Adventures**: Integrate a GPS tracking feature into a durable, waterproof flashlight that can withstand harsh outdoor environments. This flashlight would also have a built-in compass, a weather station to monitor temperature, humidity, and barometric pressure, and an SOS signal capability. It would be an essential tool for hikers, campers, and other outdoor enthusiasts, providing safety and navigation assistance. "
