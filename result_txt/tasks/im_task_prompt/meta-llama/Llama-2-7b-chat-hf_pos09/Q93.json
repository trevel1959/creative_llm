    "\"Spare Me a Dream\": Create a bowling ball with a unique design that incorporates a dreamcatcher element. The ball would have a web pattern on its surface, with feathers and beads attached to the strings. When rolled down the lane, the ball would create a hypnotic pattern that would help bowlers relax and focus on their game.",
    "\"The Perfect Strike\": Develop a bowling ball with a special feature that simulates the sound of a strike. When the ball is rolled and hits the pins, it would produce a satisfying \"ding\" sound, creating a psychological advantage for the bowler. The ball would also have a sleek, aerodynamic design to enhance its performance on the lane.",
    "\"Lane Lights\": Create a bowling ball with built-in LED lights that illuminate the lane as it travels. The lights would create a mesmerizing display of colors and patterns, making the game more visually appealing and exciting. The ball would also have a special feature that allows the bowler to customize the light show, adding an extra layer of fun and personalization to the game.",
    "\"Power Punch\": Develop a bowling ball with a unique weight distribution that provides extra power and momentum. The ball would have a heavy core and a lighter outer layer, allowing it to generate more energy and speed as it rolls down the lane. The design would also include a special texture on the surface that would provide extra grip and control, giving bowlers more power and accuracy.",
    "\"Gutter Buster\": Create a bowling ball with a unique shape and design that makes it more resistant to hitting the gutter. The ball would have a rounded, teardrop shape that would allow it to curve around the gutter and hit the pins more consistently. The ball would also have a special coating that would help it slide smoothly over the lane, reducing the risk of hooking or bouncing out of the strike zone."
