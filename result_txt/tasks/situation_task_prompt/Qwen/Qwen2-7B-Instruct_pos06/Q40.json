    "**Solar-Powered Rechargeable Batteries**: Develop rechargeable batteries that can be charged using solar panels. These batteries can be used as a backup power source when traditional power grids fail or batteries stop working. The key innovation here lies in creating more efficient solar cells that can capture sunlight even under cloudy conditions. Confidence Score: 0.9",
    "**Kinetic Energy Harvesting Devices**: Design wearable gadgets that harness kinetic energy from body movements. For example, a smartwatch that generates electricity through a small generator when you move your arm or a ring that charges your phone while you're walking. This technology could be integrated into other devices like smartphones, tablets, and laptops. Confidence Score: 0.85",
    "**Wearable Thermal Power Generators**: Create a line of clothing and accessories that convert body heat into electrical energy. This could be particularly useful during cold climates or for people who spend most of their time indoors. Confidence Score: 0.8",
    "**Portable Nuclear Reactor**: Develop a small-scale nuclear reactor that can be carried by individuals. This reactor would produce enough power to charge various devices and provide a reliable source of electricity. However, this idea comes with significant safety concerns, which must be addressed thoroughly before implementation. Confidence Score: 0.7",
    "**Fossil Fuel-Electricity Hybrid Systems**: Design devices that can operate on both renewable energy sources and fossil fuels (in an emergency) when necessary. For instance, a portable generator that uses biodiesel or compressed natural gas in addition to solar or wind power. This approach provides flexibility but also raises environmental concerns, so careful consideration is needed. Confidence Score: 0.75"
