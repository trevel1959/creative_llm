    "**Eco-Friendly Venue**: Choose a venue that's already eco-friendly, such as a historic mansion or a botanical garden. If that's not possible, consider renting a venue that's willing to work with you to reduce waste and carbon footprint. You could also consider having the ceremony and reception in the same location to minimize transportation.",
    "**Sustainable Decor**: Use locally sourced, biodegradable, or repurposed materials for decorations. Consider using flowers, branches, and leaves to create a beautiful and natural look. You could also reuse items from previous weddings or events to reduce waste.",
    "**Eco-Friendly Favors**: Instead of giving guests traditional wedding favors, consider giving them a small potted plant, a packet of wildflower seeds, or a handmade candle made from natural wax. This will not only reduce waste but also give guests a thoughtful and memorable gift.",
    "**Zero-Waste Food**: Plan a menu that's zero-waste, which means using every part of the food to minimize waste. Consider hiring a caterer who specializes in zero-waste cuisine or using a food truck that can reduce food waste by using leftover ingredients. You could also have a composting station for food scraps.",
    "**Carbon Offset**: Calculate the carbon footprint of your wedding and offset it by investing in renewable energy projects or reforestation efforts. You could also consider using electric or hybrid vehicles for transportation or encouraging guests to carpool or use public transportation."
