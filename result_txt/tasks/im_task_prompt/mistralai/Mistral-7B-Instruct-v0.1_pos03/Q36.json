    "Create a smart knife that uses machine learning to improve its cutting capabilities over time. The knife would analyze the type of food it is cutting and adjust its blade angle and pressure to achieve the perfect cut. This would result in a knife that can cut through anything with ease and precision.",
    "Design a knife that is made entirely out of recycled materials. The handle could be made from recycled plastic, while the blade could be made from recycled steel. This would be a great way to reduce waste and promote sustainability.",
    "Create a knife that is equipped with a built-in cutting board. The cutting board would be attached to the knife, allowing users to easily chop vegetables or fruits without having to switch between different surfaces. This would be a great way to save time and reduce the risk of cross-contamination.",
    "Design a knife that is equipped with a built-in safety mechanism. The knife would have a mechanism that prevents the blade from closing on its own, reducing the risk of accidents. This would be a great way to promote safety and reduce the risk of injuries.",
    "Create a knife that is designed to be used in extreme conditions. The knife would be made from high-quality materials that can withstand extreme temperatures and harsh environments. This would be a great way to promote durability and reliability in situations where a regular knife might fail."
