    "Building a makeshift shelter: One of the most important things to do when stranded on a deserted island is to build a shelter to protect yourself from the elements. You can use natural materials like branches, leaves, and vines to construct a rudimentary shelter. You can also use your clothing or any available items to create a windbreak and a waterproof covering.",
    "Finding food and water: You will need to find sources of food and water to survive on the island. You can look for edible plants, fruits, and nuts, or try to catch fish or other small animals. You can also use your knowledge of survival techniques to start a fire and cook your food.",
    "Signaling for help: If you are stranded on a deserted island, it's important to signal for help. You can use a mirror or other reflective surface to signal passing planes or boats. You can also use smoke signals or a bonfire to attract attention.",
    "Building a raft: If you need to escape the island, you can build a raft using natural materials like branches, vines, and leaves. You can also use your clothing or any available items to make a waterproof covering.",
