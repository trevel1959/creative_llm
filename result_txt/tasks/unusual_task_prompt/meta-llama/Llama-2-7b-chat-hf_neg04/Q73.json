    "Smart Bulb: Create a lightbulb that can connect to the internet and be controlled through a smartphone app. This bulb can adjust its brightness and color based on the time of day, the user's mood, or the activity it detects in the room. It can also be used to control other smart devices in the home, such as a thermostat or a security camera.",
    "Energy Harvesting Bulb: Develop a lightbulb that can harness energy from the environment to power itself. This could involve using solar panels, wind turbines, or even kinetic energy from foot traffic in a busy area. This would eliminate the need for an external power source and reduce waste.",
    "Mood-Sensing Bulb: Create a lightbulb that can detect the user's emotions and adjust the light's color and brightness accordingly. For example, if the user is feeling sad, the bulb could change to a soothing blue light, while a more energetic red light could be used for a workout session.",
    "Personalized Lighting System: Develop a lightbulb that can be customized to the user's preferences through a smartphone app. This could include adjusting the brightness, color temperature, and even the shape of the light beam. This would allow users to create a personalized lighting system that suits their needs and moods.",
    "Augmented Reality Bulb: Create a lightbulb that can display augmented reality (AR) content, such as images, videos, or even interactive games. This could be achieved through the use of a small display screen built into the bulb, or through the use of a special lens that can be placed over the bulb to create a more immersive experience. This would allow users to experience a new level of interactive lighting that can enhance their daily lives."
