    "Once upon a time, in a land where the sun kissed the peaks, there was a mountain named Tundra. Unlike other mountains, Tundra loved to dance. Each night, as the stars twinkled above, he would sway and shimmy, his snow-capped summit shimmering like diamonds. The wind would whistle a joyful tune, and the trees would sway along, joining his dance. One evening, a lonely traveler stumbled upon Tundra's midnight ballet. Enchanted, the traveler began to dance too, and together they twirled until dawn broke. From that day on, Tundra found joy in sharing his dance, inspiring others to join his nightly celebration.",
