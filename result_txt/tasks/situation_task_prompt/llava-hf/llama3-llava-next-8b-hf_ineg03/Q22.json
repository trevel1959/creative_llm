    "Bicycle-friendly infrastructure: Encouraging the use of bicycles for transportation would become a necessity. This would involve creating extensive bicycle lanes, bike-sharing programs, and secure bike parking facilities to ensure that people can easily navigate the city on two wheels.",
    "Public transportation: Cities would need to invest in a comprehensive public transportation system that includes buses, trams, subways, and trains. This would help people move around the city without relying on personal vehicles.",
    "Electric vehicles: Encouraging the use of electric vehicles would become a priority. These vehicles would not require roads, and cities could develop charging infrastructure to support their use.",
    "Sky bridges and tunnels: Cities could build sky bridges and tunnels to connect buildings and facilitate movement between them. This would allow people to move vertically and horizontally within the city without needing to rely on roads.",
    "Maglev transportation: Cities could invest in magnetic levitation (Maglev) transportation systems, which would allow for faster and more efficient movement within the city."
