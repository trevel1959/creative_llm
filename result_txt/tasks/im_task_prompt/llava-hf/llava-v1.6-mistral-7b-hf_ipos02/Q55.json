    "**Ergonomic Design**: Redesign the fountain pen to have an ergonomic grip that conforms to the user's hand, reducing strain and fatigue during long writing sessions. This can be achieved by using a combination of materials and shapes that provide a comfortable and secure hold.",
    "**Ink Level Indicator**: Add a built-in ink level indicator that shows the user when the pen is running low on ink. This can be a simple, visual indicator like a small window or light that changes color when the ink is running low, or a digital display that provides an accurate ink level reading.",
    "**Integrated Voice Recorder**: Equip the fountain pen with a built-in voice recorder that allows the user to dictate their thoughts or ideas, making it a multi-functional tool for both writing and speaking. This can be achieved by incorporating a microphone and a small speaker within the pen's design.",
    "**Wireless Connectivity**: Make the fountain pen wireless by integrating Bluetooth connectivity. This would allow the user to sync their writing with digital devices, such as smartphones or tablets, for easy editing and sharing of their work.",
    "**Smart Ink Sensor**: Develop a smart ink sensor that can detect the type of ink being used and provide information about its properties, such as its color, saturation, and drying time. This can be achieved by using a combination of sensors, such as infrared or pressure sensors, to analyze the ink's composition."
