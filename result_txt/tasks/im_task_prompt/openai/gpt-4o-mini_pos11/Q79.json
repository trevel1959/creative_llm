    "**Multi-Functional Hanger**: Design a clothes hanger that includes additional features such as a small built-in mirror and a retractable brush. This would allow users to quickly check their outfit and remove lint or pet hair before heading out. The mirror could be adjustable for better angles, making it a practical accessory for those with limited space.",
    "**Adjustable Size Hanger**: Create a hanger that can easily adjust its width to accommodate various clothing sizes and styles. This could be achieved through a sliding mechanism that allows the user to expand or contract the hanger based on whether they are hanging a childâ€™s shirt or an oversized coat. This versatility would reduce the number of hangers needed in a closet.",
    "**Eco-Friendly Hanger**: Develop a line of hangers made from sustainable materials, such as bamboo or recycled plastics. These hangers would be designed to be biodegradable or recyclable at the end of their lifecycle. They could also feature an appealing aesthetic, promoting eco-consciousness in fashion and home organization.",
    "**Hanger with Built-in LED Lighting**: Introduce a hanger that has small LED lights integrated into its design. This would provide soft lighting in the closet, making it easier to find clothes in dimly lit spaces. The lights could be activated by motion sensors, ensuring they only turn on when someone approaches, thereby saving battery life.",
    "**Clothing Care Hanger**: Design a hanger that incorporates a small compartment for storing essential clothing care items, such as fabric spray, a lint roller, or a small steamer. This would allow users to quickly freshen up their garments without having to dig through drawers or cabinets, making it a convenient solution for busy lifestyles."
