    "**Creating a Sleep Mask with Solar Energy**: Develop a wearable sleep mask that harnesses solar energy during the day. The device stores this energy in batteries, which then powers a gentle light source or soothing sounds at night, mimicking the darkness and calm of the night sky. This innovative solution would help individuals adapt to the lack of nighttime, making sleep more manageable during the continuous daylight.",
    "**Daytime Nap Stations**: Design and install a series of nap stations equipped with adjustable light settings, noise cancellation technology, and comfortable sleeping pods. These stations can be located in public spaces like parks, libraries, or commercial centers. By providing a controlled environment that simulates nighttime, people can take short naps during the day without feeling disoriented.",
    "**Sunlight Mimicking Bed Sheets**: Create bed sheets infused with micro-LEDs that emit light in various wavelengths, designed to mimic the natural spectrum of sunlight. These sheets could be programmed to change their light output based on different times of the day, helping regulate the body's circadian rhythm and promoting better sleep patterns in the absence of traditional night-time.",
    "**Sleeping Pods with Light Filters**: Develop sleeping pods that feature retractable, customizable light filters. Users can adjust the intensity and color of light entering the pod, creating a comfortable, dark environment even when there is plenty of natural light outside. This innovation allows for personal control over the sleep environment, enhancing the quality of sleep in a 24-hour world.",
    "**Nighttime Sensory Experience Apps**: Create an app that offers a virtual nighttime experience, including ambient sounds, darkness simulation, and temperature control. Users can customize the app to match their preferred sleep conditions, effectively replicating the comfort and safety of night-time. This digital solution provides a cost-effective and portable way to achieve a good night's rest without the need for physical modifications to one's surroundings."
