    "**Adaptive Tinting Technology**: Develop glasses with lenses that automatically adjust their tint based on sunlight exposure. Utilizing photochromic technology, the lenses would darken in bright light and return to clear indoors. This feature would not only enhance comfort but also protect the eyes from harmful UV rays, making them suitable for outdoor activities.",
    "**Comfort Fit Design**: Introduce a customizable frame design that allows users to adjust the fit of their glasses. By integrating flexible materials and adjustable temples, wearers could easily modify the width and angle of the frames for maximum comfort. This could also include a memory foam nose pad that molds to the wearerâ€™s nose shape for a personalized fit.",
    "**Integrated Audio System**: Create glasses that feature bone conduction audio technology, allowing users to listen to music or take phone calls without needing earbuds. The audio would transmit through the bones of the skull, leaving the ears open to ambient sounds. This would be ideal for those who want to stay aware of their surroundings while enjoying audio content.",
    "**Built-in Cleaning Mechanism**: Design glasses with a self-cleaning lens feature that uses ultrasonic waves to remove smudges and dirt. By pressing a discreet button on the frame, users could activate a cleaning cycle that would vibrate the lenses, dislodging debris and ensuring clear vision at all times.",
    "**Mood Lighting Frames**: Introduce frames that incorporate LED lights, allowing users to change the color of the frames based on their mood or outfit. This feature could be controlled via a smartphone app, where users could select from a palette of colors or even set the lights to change dynamically based on their surroundings, making a fashion statement while expressing their personality."
