    "We can look at photos of ourselves to see what we look like.",
    "We can rely on videos to see ourselves.",
    "We can use touch and memory to remember what it feels like to see ourselves.",
    "We can rely on past reflections to see what we look like.",
    "We can ask past friends and family to tell us what we looked like and make up a look for ourselves."
