    "**Artificially Grown Vitamins**: This idea involves cultivating vitamin-rich substances in a laboratory setting. Scientists could use genetic engineering to create strains of bacteria or fungi that produce specific vitamins and minerals. These could then be processed into powders, tablets, or liquid supplements, ensuring a consistent supply of essential nutrients.",
    "**Plant-Based Foods as Alternatives**: While fruits and vegetables may disappear, there are numerous other plant-based sources of vitamins and minerals that could be utilized. For instance, grains like quinoa, amaranth, and buckwheat are rich in B vitamins, iron, and magnesium. Nuts, seeds, and legumes provide healthy fats, protein, and a variety of vitamins and minerals. Additionally, leafy greens such as kale, spinach, and collard greens are excellent sources of vitamins A, C, K, and iron.",
    "**Incorporating Seaweed and Other Marine Plants**: Seaweed is a highly nutritious food source that contains an array of vitamins and minerals, including iodine, calcium, and iron. Other marine plants like kelp, dulse, and nori can also be cultivated and consumed for their nutritional benefits. Incorporating these into meals as snacks, salads, or soups can help maintain a balanced diet.",
    "**Developing Cultivated Fruits and Vegetables**: Advances in hydroponics and vertical farming could lead to the creation of new, nutrient-dense crops that don't rely on traditional soil. These plants could be designed to have higher concentrations of vitamins and minerals, even without sunlight, by using artificial light and precise nutrient solutions. This technology could potentially sustain populations in various environments and during times when natural resources are scarce.",
    "**Nutrient-Dense Supplements and Blends**: In the absence of a diverse range of fruits and vegetables, creating custom blends of powdered supplements could ensure a comprehensive intake of necessary vitamins and minerals. These blends might include algae extracts, spirulina, chlorella, and other superfoods known for their high nutrient content. They could be mixed into drinks, smoothies, or used in cooking to enhance flavor and nutrition. "
