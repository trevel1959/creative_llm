    "**Innovative Temperature Control Smart Electric Kettle:** Design an electric kettle that integrates advanced temperature control features. The kettle would have a touch screen interface for setting specific temperatures (for example, precise water temperatures required for different types of tea or coffee). It could also come with presets for common beverages, learning user preferences over time to offer customized settings. The kettle might feature a voice assistant integration, allowing users to set temperature using voice commands. Additionally, it could monitor the water level and automatically shut off when the water reaches the desired temperature or when it's about to boil, preventing overheating.",
    "**Portable Electric Kettle with Solar Power Compatibility:** Create a compact, lightweight electric kettle that can be powered by both electricity and solar energy. This would be perfect for camping trips, picnics, or any outdoor activity where access to power may be limited. The kettle would include a solar panel that can charge its internal battery, which then powers the heating element. A smart charging management system ensures efficient use of energy, maximizing battery life and minimizing environmental impact.",
    "**Smart Connectivity and Voice Control for the Kitchen:** Integrate an electric kettle with home automation systems, allowing it to connect wirelessly to smart home platforms like Amazon Alexa or Google Home. Users can command their kettle to start boiling water through voice commands, receive notifications on their smartphone app when water is ready, or even schedule automatic boiling times for morning tea or coffee routines. This integration would provide convenience and make managing daily tasks more seamless.",
    "**Water Filtration and Purification System Inside the Kettle:** Develop an electric kettle that includes a built-in water filtration and purification system. This would remove impurities, minerals, and contaminants from tap water, providing users with cleaner, healthier drinking water without the need for additional filtration systems. The filter would be replaceable, ensuring continuous high-quality water output.",
    "**Multi-Functionality Electric Kettle with Steam Function:** Create an electric kettle that doubles as a steamer, combining the functions of two kitchen appliances in one device. When not used for boiling water, the kettle can be flipped or rotated to expose its steam function, which heats up water vapor to provide gentle food heating or fast food defrosting capabilities. This design saves counter space and reduces clutter, making it ideal for small kitchens or those looking to minimize appliance usage."
