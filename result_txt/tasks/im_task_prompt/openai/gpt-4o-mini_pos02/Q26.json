    "**Odor Neutralizing System**: Incorporating a built-in odor neutralizer, this trash can would use a combination of activated charcoal and a fan system to eliminate unpleasant smells. Users could replace or recharge the charcoal, and the fan could circulate air, ensuring that the trash can remains odor-free even with organic waste inside. This feature would be particularly useful for kitchens or bathrooms.",
    "**Self-Sealing Trash Bags**: This innovative trash can would feature a mechanism that automatically seals the trash bag once it's full. With a simple button press, the bag would be sealed tight, preventing spills and odors. Users could then easily remove the bag without the mess of tying it up manually. This would be particularly useful for busy households or those with young children.",
    "**Recycling Reminder and Education Panel**: The trash can could come equipped with an interactive LED display that educates users about proper recycling practices. The panel could show reminders based on local recycling guidelines, display fun facts about waste reduction, and even provide tips on composting. It could be updated via a smartphone app to reflect any changes in local recycling rules.",
    "**Compostable Trash Can Liners**: To further enhance sustainability, this trash can could be designed to use compostable liners made from plant-based materials. These liners would break down naturally in composting facilities, reducing plastic waste. The trash can could also have a designated compartment for compostable waste, making it easier for users to contribute to composting efforts.",
    "**Built-In Compactor**: This trash can would include a compaction feature that allows users to compress their waste, maximizing space and reducing the frequency of bag changes. With a simple foot pedal or button, users could compact their trash, making it more efficient and less likely to overflow. This would be especially beneficial for households with high waste production."
