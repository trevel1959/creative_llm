    "**Biological Clocks**: Humans have an internal clock called the circadian rhythm, which regulates our sleep-wake cycle. By paying attention to our body's cues, we could use this natural clock to estimate the time of day.",
    "**Social Cues**: In a society without clocks and watches, people would rely on social cues to keep track of time. This could include the actions of others, such as the opening and closing of markets, the timing of meals, and the schedule of communal activities.",
    "**Timekeeping Technology**: Although clocks and watches are not around, other forms of technology could be used to keep track of time. For example, a smartphone with a built-in GPS could estimate the time based on the position of the sun and the user's location.",
    "**Communal Timekeeping**: In a world without personal timekeeping devices, communities could establish a centralized timekeeping system. This could involve a bell or a series of bells that ring at regular intervals to signal the passage of time.",
    "**Personal Timekeeping Devices**: In a post-apocalyptic world, people might create their own timekeeping devices. This could include wristbands that use sensors to detect the wearer's heart rate and estimate the time based on their physiological rhythms."
