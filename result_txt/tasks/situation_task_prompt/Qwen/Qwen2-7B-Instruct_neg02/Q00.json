    "**Human-Powered Travel**: If all cars stopped working, humans could use their own strength to move around. This could be done by walking, cycling or even using traditional methods like rowing boats. The development of efficient, human-powered vehicles, such as bicycles equipped with storage for daily needs, could facilitate longer journeys between cities.",
    "**Animal-Powered Travel**: Historically, animals have been used for transportation in many cultures. Reintroducing horse-drawn carriages or donkey-drawn carts into modern society could provide a feasible alternative. These could be used both within urban areas and for longer trips between cities, potentially requiring the establishment of dedicated animal routes and stabling facilities.",
    "**Waterway Transportation**: Utilizing existing waterways (rivers, canals) for transportation could be an efficient method to travel between cities. Boats and barges could transport people and goods along these routes. Cities near waterways could establish docking stations and transit hubs to facilitate this mode of travel.",
    "**Inflatable Rafts and Tents**: In situations where traditional infrastructure is severely damaged or non-existent, inflatable rafts and tents could serve as temporary shelters and means of transportation. These could be made from durable materials and designed to withstand various environmental conditions. They could be used to navigate rivers, lakes, and even oceans, depending on the distance and destination.",
    "**Community-Driven Travel Networks**: Building a community-based transportation system could involve setting up carpooling services, shared bicycles, and pedestrian-friendly zones. Each city could develop its own network, allowing individuals to connect with others traveling to the same destinations. This could reduce the need for personal vehicles and promote a sense of community while facilitating efficient travel."
