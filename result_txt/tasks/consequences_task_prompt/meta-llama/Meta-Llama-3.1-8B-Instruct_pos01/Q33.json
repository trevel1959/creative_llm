    "**Massive Migrations**: With their increased size, animals would require more food, water, and space. This could lead to massive migrations of species from areas with limited resources to areas with more abundant resources. For example, a giant elephant would need to travel long distances to find food, leading to a massive migration of elephants from Africa to Asia. This could have significant impacts on ecosystems and human populations. Confidence: 0.8",
    "**Ecosystem Upheaval**: The sudden increase in size of animals would disrupt the delicate balance of ecosystems. Predators would struggle to adapt to their new prey, and prey species would struggle to evade their new predators. This could lead to a collapse of entire ecosystems, with cascading effects on the environment and human societies. Confidence: 0.9",
    "**Infrastructure Destruction**: A world with giant animals would require significant changes to infrastructure, such as buildings, roads, and bridges. The increased weight and size of animals would put a strain on these structures, leading to widespread destruction and reconstruction. For example, a giant elephant could easily knock down a building, requiring a massive reconstruction effort. Confidence: 0.7",
    "**Evolutionary Adaptations**: The sudden increase in size of animals would lead to rapid evolutionary adaptations. Species would need to adapt quickly to their new size, leading to the emergence of new traits and characteristics. For example, giant birds might develop stronger wings to fly with their increased weight, while giant mammals might develop more efficient respiratory systems to cope with their increased size. Confidence: 0.9",
    "**Human Society Upheaval**: The presence of giant animals would require significant changes to human society. People would need to adapt to living alongside these massive creatures, leading to changes in agriculture, transportation, and urban planning. For example, cities might be designed with giant animal corridors, and agriculture might focus on crops that can be harvested by giant animals. Confidence: 0.8"
