    "**Exhibition Venue Capacity**: The exhibition venue may not be large enough to accommodate the number of art pieces and visitors expected. This could lead to overcrowding, which may negatively impact the viewing experience and create a safety hazard. To address this issue, consider renting a larger venue or selecting a smaller number of art pieces that fit within the available space.",
    "**Artist Availability**: The exhibition requires the presence of the artist for the opening night and possibly for other events. However, the artist may have scheduling conflicts or be unable to attend due to unforeseen circumstances. To mitigate this risk, consider having a backup plan in place, such as a video message or a substitute artist, and ensure that the artist is aware of the exhibition's schedule and requirements.",
    "**Technical Issues**: The exhibition may feature interactive or digital art pieces that require technical support. However, technical issues may arise, such as equipment failure or connectivity problems, which could disrupt the exhibition experience. To address this issue, consider hiring a technical support team, having a backup plan in place, and conducting thorough testing of the equipment before the exhibition.",
    "**Marketing and Promotion**: The exhibition requires effective marketing and promotion to attract visitors and generate buzz. However, the marketing strategy may not be effective, or the promotion may not reach the target audience. To address this issue, consider conducting market research, creating a social media campaign, and partnering with local art organizations or influencers to promote the exhibition.",
    "**Financial Constraints**: The exhibition requires significant financial resources to cover costs such as venue rental, artwork transportation, and marketing. However, the budget may be limited, or unexpected expenses may arise, which could impact the exhibition's success. To address this issue, consider creating a detailed budget, seeking sponsorships or grants, and exploring cost-saving options."
