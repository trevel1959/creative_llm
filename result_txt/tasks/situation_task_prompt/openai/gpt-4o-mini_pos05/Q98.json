The design could incorporate sustainable materials, and users could refill them with different combinations of natural ingredients to customize their home fragrances.",
    "**Aromatic Cooking Classes**: Introduce cooking classes that emphasize the use of aromatic herbs and spices to create not only delicious meals but also pleasant ambient scents.
