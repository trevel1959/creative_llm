    "**Solar Still for Fresh Water**: Create a solar still to convert seawater into fresh drinking water. Dig a shallow pit and place a container in the center to collect the distilled water. Cover the pit with a clear plastic sheet, securing the edges with rocks. The sun will heat the seawater, causing it to evaporate and condense on the underside of the plastic, eventually dripping into the container. This method is efficient and requires minimal resources.",
    "**Foraging and Fermenting**: Familiarize yourself with the local flora and fauna. Instead of solely relying on hunting or fishing, explore foraging for edible plants, fruits, and nuts. To enhance your diet and preserve food, consider fermenting fruits or vegetables. This not only extends their shelf life but also provides beneficial probiotics, improving your gut health while you adapt to island life.",
    "**Signal with Sound**: Instead of focusing solely on visual signals for rescue, utilize sound. Create a large, hollowed-out log or a series of rocks that can produce a loud noise when struck. This can carry further than visual signals, especially in dense foliage. You could also fashion a simple wind instrument from bamboo or palm fronds to create a distinctive sound that might attract attention.",
    "**Bioluminescent Light Source**: If the island has bioluminescent organisms, such as certain types of plankton or fungi, harness their glow for light. Collect them in a clear container and agitate them to activate their luminescence. This could serve as a unique light source at night, helping you navigate or signal for help without using a fire, which might attract unwanted attention.",
    "**Animal Tracking for Food**: Instead of traditional hunting, focus on tracking animal movements to understand their behavior. Create a \"wildlife observation\" journal to document patterns of animals you see. This can help you set up traps or snares in areas where animals are likely to pass, ensuring a more efficient means of securing food while minimizing energy expenditure."
