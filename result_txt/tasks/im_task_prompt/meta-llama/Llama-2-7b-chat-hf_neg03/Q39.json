    "Garden Hose with Built-In Watering Can: Create a garden hose with a built-in watering can feature that allows users to water their plants without having to stop and detach the hose. This innovative design would feature a detachable watering can attached to the end of the hose, making it easy to water plants without any hassle. The watering can would be made of a lightweight, durable material and would be easy to clean.",
    "Self-Watering Garden Hose: Design a garden hose that can water plants on its own. This smart hose would have a built-in water storage system that can be filled with water from a tap or a water source. As the water flows through the hose, it would automatically water the plants, ensuring that they receive the right amount of water at the right time. This would save time and effort for gardeners, especially those with large gardens.",
    "Adjustable Garden Hose: Create a garden hose with an adjustable length feature that allows users to customize the length of the hose to suit their needs. This would be particularly useful for gardeners who have limited space or who need to water plants at different heights. The hose would feature a simple and easy-to-use adjustment mechanism, making it easy to extend or shorten the hose as needed.",
    "Garden Hose with Integrated Water Filter: Design a garden hose with an integrated water filter that removes impurities and contaminants from the water as it flows through the hose. This would provide clean and safe water for plants, without the need for an additional water filter. The filter would be made of a durable and easy-to-clean material, such as a fine mesh or ceramic, and would be easy to replace when needed.",
    "Garden Hose with LED Lighting: Create a garden hose with built-in LED lighting that illuminates the area around the plants while watering. This would be particularly useful for gardeners who want to water their plants at night or in low-light conditions. The LED lights would be powered by a rechargeable battery, making them easy to use and maintain. The lighting could also be adjusted to provide different levels of brightness, depending on the user's needs."
