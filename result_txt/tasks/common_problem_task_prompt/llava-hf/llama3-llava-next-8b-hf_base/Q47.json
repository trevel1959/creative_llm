    "Compatibility issues: Another potential problem is compatibility issues between different hardware components. For example, a motherboard may not be compatible with certain types of RAM or graphics cards, or a specific type of CPU may not be compatible with a particular motherboard.",
    "Availability of parts: Finding the right parts can be a challenge, especially for custom builds. Certain components may be hard to find or may be out of stock, which can lead to delays in the build process.",
    "Cost: Building a computer from scratch can be expensive, especially if you want high-end components. The cost of individual parts can add up quickly, and it may not be feasible for everyone.",
    "Time: Building a computer from scratch can be time-consuming, especially if you are not familiar with the process. It may take several hours or even days to assemble and set up the system.",
    "Warranty and support: When you build a computer from scratch, you may not have access to the same warranty and support as you would with a pre-built system. This can be a concern if you encounter any issues with the hardware."
