    "Once in a serene pond, there lived a frog named Felix who dreamed of becoming a prince. Every night, he gazed at the stars, wishing for a life beyond the lily pads. One fateful evening, a kind fairy heard his wishes and decided to grant them. With a wave of her wand, Felix transformed into a handsome prince. However, he soon realized that royal life came with burdens: endless meetings and no time for hopping. Longing for the simplicity of his pond, he returned to the fairy, who graciously turned him back. Felix learned that true happiness was found in being himself.",
