    "A pen that writes in different colors: This pen would have a unique feature that allows it to change colors with a simple twist of the cap. For example, the user could twist the cap once to change the ink color to blue, twist it again to change it to red, and so on. This would allow the user to create a wide range of colors and designs with just one pen.",
    "A pen that draws on multiple surfaces: This pen would have a special tip that allows it to write on different surfaces, such as wood, metal, or even fabric. The user could write on a whiteboard, and then easily transfer the notes to a piece of paper or a wall without having to erase the original mark. This would be especially useful for brainstorming sessions or for creating temporary art installations.",
    "A pen that creates 3D images: This pen would have a special tip that extrudes a special ink that hardens when exposed to light. The user could draw a 2D image, and then use the pen to create a 3D version of it. The resulting image would have depth and texture, allowing the user to create detailed and realistic 3D artwork without any special training or equipment.",
    "A pen that writes in different languages: This pen would have a built-in language translator that allows it to write in multiple languages. The user could write a message in one language, and then the pen would automatically translate it into another language. This would be especially useful for travelers or businesspeople who need to communicate with people who speak different languages.",
    "A pen that creates custom patterns: This pen would have a special tip that can create intricate patterns and designs. The user could choose from a variety of patterns, such as stripes, polka dots, or florals, and the pen would create the design automatically. This would be a fun and creative way to add personalized touches to clothing, accessories, or even home decor."
