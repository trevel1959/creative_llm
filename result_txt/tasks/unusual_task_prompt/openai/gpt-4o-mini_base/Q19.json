    "**Scented Drawer Freshener**: Instead of traditional air fresheners or sachets, place a small candle in your drawers or closets. As the candle sits, it will slowly release its fragrance, keeping your clothes and linens smelling fresh. You can also carve small holes into the candle to increase the scent release without lighting it.",
    "**DIY Wax Seal**: Use a candle to create personalized wax seals for letters or invitations. Melt the candle wax and drip it onto the envelope's flap, then use a stamp or an old coin to press into the wax before it hardens. This adds a unique, personal touch to your correspondence.",
    "**Mood Lighting for Outdoor Gatherings**: Instead of standard string lights, place several candles in decorative holders around your outdoor space. They can create a romantic or cozy atmosphere for evening gatherings. To make it more unique, try floating candles in a bowl of water or use colored candles for a festive touch.",
    "**Paint Palette for Artists**: Artists can use the flat surface of a candle to mix paints or as a temporary palette. The wax provides a non-porous surface that makes it easy to clean up after use. Simply scrape off the dried paint, and the candle is ready for the next session.",
    "**Natural Insect Repellent**: Certain candles made from citronella or other natural oils can serve as effective insect repellents.
