    "**Solar-Powered Charging with Smart Solar Panels**: Develop a wristwatch that incorporates advanced solar panels on the strap and face. These panels could be designed to blend seamlessly with the aesthetics of the watch, ensuring it remains stylish while being eco-friendly. This feature would reduce the need for battery replacements and allow for longer usage without charging, appealing to environmentally conscious consumers.",
    "**Modular Functionality**: Create a modular wristwatch where users can customize the functionalities by swapping out different modules. For instance, one module could focus on fitness tracking, another on navigation, and another on social media notifications. This allows the wearer to adapt the watch to their daily needs and preferences, making it a versatile accessory for various lifestyles.",
    "**Augmented Reality (AR) Interface**: Incorporate an AR feature that uses a small projector or a transparent display to project information onto the user’s wrist or surroundings. This could provide notifications, navigation directions, or even health data without needing to look at the watch face. The watch could connect with smart glasses to enhance the AR experience, making it a futuristic wearable tech accessory.",
    "**Integrated Health Monitoring**: Expand the health monitoring capabilities of the wristwatch by incorporating sensors that can measure blood glucose levels, hydration levels, and even stress indicators through cortisol detection. The watch could sync with a health app that provides personalized health advice and alerts, making it an essential tool for health-conscious individuals.",
    "**Personalized AI Assistant**: Equip the wristwatch with an AI-driven personal assistant that learns the wearer’s habits and preferences over time. This assistant could manage schedules, provide reminders, and suggest activities based on the wearer’s routine. For example, if the watch detects a drop in activity levels, it could suggest a short walk or workout, enhancing the user's productivity and well-being."
