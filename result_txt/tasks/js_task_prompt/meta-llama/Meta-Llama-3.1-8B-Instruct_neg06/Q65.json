Their bodies are composed of intricate networks of glowing, fiber-optic-like strands that absorb and store energy from the forest's bioluminescent fungi. As they move through the forest, their bodies shift and change color, reflecting the surrounding environment and communicating with one another through a complex system of bio-luminescent signals.

As they sing, their bodies shift and change, reflecting the ever-changing harmony of the universe.",
