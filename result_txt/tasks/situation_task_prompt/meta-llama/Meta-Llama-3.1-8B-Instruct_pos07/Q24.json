    "**Smart Contact Lenses 2.0**: With the sudden disappearance of traditional glasses and contact lenses, the demand for innovative solutions would skyrocket. Companies would quickly develop smart contact lenses that not only correct vision but also provide additional features like: \t* Built-in microchips for augmented reality experiences",
    "**Personalized 3D-Printed Prosthetic Eyes**: In the absence of traditional vision correction, people with poor vision would turn to advanced prosthetic solutions. Companies would develop 3D-printed prosthetic eyes that can be customized to match individual eye colors and shapes. These prosthetic eyes would be equipped with advanced sensors and cameras, allowing users to see the world in a new way.",
    "**Virtual Reality (VR) and Augmented Reality (AR) Headsets**: As people adapt to life without glasses and contact lenses, VR and AR headsets would become the new norm. These headsets would provide an immersive experience, allowing users to interact with virtual objects and environments in a more realistic way. Companies would develop advanced VR and AR software, enabling users to perform tasks like reading, watching movies, and even playing games without the need for traditional vision correction.",
    "**Biometric Vision Correction**: Scientists would focus on developing biometric vision correction techniques that use advanced biometrics, such as DNA analysis, to create personalized vision correction solutions. This would involve analyzing an individual's genetic makeup to determine the optimal vision correction for their specific eyes. Biometric vision correction would revolutionize the way we approach vision correction, making it more precise and effective.",
    "**Neuro-Optics**: Neuro-optics would be a game-changer in the world without glasses and contact lenses. This technology would involve implanting tiny electrodes in the brain, which would decode and interpret visual signals, bypassing the need for traditional vision correction. Neuro-optics would enable people with poor vision to see the world in a new way, with enhanced clarity and precision."
