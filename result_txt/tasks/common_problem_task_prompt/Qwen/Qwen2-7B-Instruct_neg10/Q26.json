    "**Resource Depletion**: The sheer number of climbers also puts a strain on resources such as water, oxygen tanks, and food supplies. There could be shortages of these critical items if not managed properly, which could jeopardize the health and safety of climbers.",
    "**Cultural Disruption**: The influx of climbers might disrupt the local Sherpa communities' way of life. They are often relied upon for guiding and logistics. This could lead to conflicts over land use, economic exploitation, and changes in cultural practices due to tourism pressures.",
    "**Economic Inequality**: While climbing Mount Everest generates revenue for local businesses and economies, there's a risk of economic inequality. Those who can afford the high costs associated with climbing (equipment, guides, permits) might have more access to opportunities, leaving others behind.",
    "**Health Risks**: The extreme altitude poses significant health risks. Not only do climbers face the dangers of altitude sickness, frostbite, and hypothermia, but there's also the issue of psychological stress. The isolation and pressure of the climb can lead to mental health issues.",
    "**Safety Concerns**: Due to the unpredictable nature of weather conditions at such high altitudes, there's always a risk of accidents. Avalanches, rock falls, and equipment failures can result in serious injuries or fatalities, posing a significant challenge for rescue operations given the remote location."
