    "**DIY Air Freshener**: Coffee filters can be used to make an effective, homemade air freshener. Cut a coffee filter into small pieces, soak them in a solution of water and essential oils (choose your favorite scent like lavender, peppermint, or lemon), then hang the soaked pieces around your home or office. The filters will slowly release their fragrance, creating a pleasant aroma.",
    "**DIY Ice Cubes for Coffee**: Instead of using ice cubes made from tap water, try using coffee-filter filled molds to create coffee-flavored ice cubes. Simply fill a silicone mold with brewed coffee (cool it first if necessary) and freeze. These cubes will cool your drink without diluting it, maintaining the rich flavor of your coffee.",
    "**DIY Paper Flowers**: Transform coffee filters into beautiful, colorful paper flowers. Dip each filter in a washable fabric paint or use markers to color them. Once dry, fold and shape the filters to form petals, assembling them to create flowers. They can be used as decorations, added to gift packages, or hung as wall art.",
    "**DIY Cat Litter Alternative**: Coffee filters can be used as an alternative to traditional cat litter. Soak them in water, wring out excess moisture, and place them in a tray with your cat's waste. This method reduces odors and is easier on the environment compared to conventional litter products.",
    "**DIY Decorative Lanterns**: Use coffee filters to make lanterns for a rustic-chic decor theme. Cut the filters into strips, tie them together in bunches, and secure them to the inside of a clear glass jar or vase. String a battery-powered LED light inside, and the filters will glow softly when lit, creating a warm, inviting atmosphere."
