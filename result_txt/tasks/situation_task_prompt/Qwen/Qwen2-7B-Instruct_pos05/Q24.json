    "**Incorporating Advanced Braille Technology**: With glasses and contact lenses disappearing, a significant challenge for those with poor vision would be to navigate their surroundings effectively. One creative solution could be the development of advanced braille technology, similar to haptic feedback systems used in smartphones. These devices could be worn as bracelets or wristbands, allowing users to 'feel' the shape, texture, and distance of objects around them. This would not only aid in everyday navigation but also enhance tactile experiences, such as recognizing different types of surfaces or objects by touch.",
    "**Intelligent Soundscapes for Navigation**: Another idea is creating an ambient auditory environment for individuals with poor vision. Using smart speakers and soundscaping technology, this system could generate sounds based on location data and environmental cues. For example, when near stairs, the system might produce a distinct set of sounds to alert the user, helping them to navigate safely without relying on visual cues. This could also include contextual audio descriptions of objects and environments they encounter, making it easier for them to understand their surroundings.",
    "**Adaptive Artificial Intelligence (AI) Personal Assistants**: Developing AI-powered personal assistants specifically designed to assist individuals with vision impairments could be highly effective. These assistants would learn the user's preferences, routines, and the layout of their home and workplace. They could provide voice commands to perform tasks, such as turning on lights, playing music, or navigating through spaces. Additionally, the AI could use machine learning to adapt to the user's changing needs over time, enhancing its functionality and effectiveness.",
    "**Enhanced Tactile Feedback Gloves**: For manual tasks that require visual input, such as cooking, crafting, or operating machinery, special gloves could be developed with enhanced tactile feedback. These gloves would have sensors embedded within them that can detect and transmit information about textures, temperatures, and pressures. Users could 'see' the difference between ingredients while cooking or feel the shape of tools and materials during crafting tasks, thus maintaining or even improving their ability to perform these activities independently.",
    "**Virtual Reality Integration for Enhanced Sensory Experience**: By leveraging virtual reality (VR) technology, individuals with poor vision could experience their environment in new ways. VR could be used to create detailed, high-definition visualizations of their surroundings, which are then projected onto surfaces like walls or floors. This allows users to \"see\" their environment in a virtual format, complete with audio and tactile feedback to further enhance their understanding of their space. This approach could also be applied to learning and training environments"
