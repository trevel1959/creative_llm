    "**Eco-Warrior**: Design a car that runs on algae-based biofuel, harnessing the power of photosynthesis to produce energy. The car's body would be made from a lightweight, recyclable material, and its wheels would be designed to minimize friction, reducing energy consumption. The Eco-Warrior would feature a sleek, aerodynamic design, with a transparent roof that allows passengers to see the algae-based biofuel tank. The interior would be equipped with a state-of-the-art infotainment system, powered by a small solar panel on the roof.",
    "**Dreamweaver**: Create a car that uses AI-powered augmented reality to transport passengers to their desired destination in a virtual world. The Dreamweaver would feature a holographic display that projects a 3D environment, complete with immersive sounds and scents. Passengers could choose from various themes, such as a tropical island or a futuristic city, and the car would adjust its interior to match the chosen environment. The AI system would learn the passenger's preferences and tailor the experience accordingly.",
    "**Aurora**: Design a car that generates its own electricity using a unique combination of piezoelectric materials and solar panels. The Aurora would feature a sleek, aerodynamic design with a color-shifting paint job that changes depending on the car's speed and direction. The interior would be equipped with a cutting-edge sound system that uses the car's generated electricity to create an immersive audio experience. The Aurora would also feature a unique \"energy-harvesting\" system that captures and stores kinetic energy from the road, reducing energy consumption.",
    "**MindDrive**: Develop a car that uses brain-computer interface (BCI) technology to read the driver's thoughts and intentions. The MindDrive would feature a futuristic design with a transparent cockpit that allows passengers to see the driver's brain activity. The BCI system would learn the driver's habits and preferences, adjusting the car's settings accordingly. The MindDrive would also feature a unique \"mind-mapped\" navigation system that plots the most efficient route based on the driver's thoughts and emotions.",
    "**Echo**: Design a car that can transform into a mobile recording studio, complete with high-end audio equipment and a state-of-the-art soundproofing system. The Echo would feature a sleek, modular design with interchangeable panels that can be customized to fit various recording configurations. The interior would be equipped with a cutting-edge mixing console and a high-definition video display. The Echo would also feature a unique \"echo-location\""
