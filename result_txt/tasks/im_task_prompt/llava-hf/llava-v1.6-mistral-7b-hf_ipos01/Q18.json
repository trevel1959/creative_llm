    "**Eco-Friendly Car**: Design a car that is powered by renewable energy sources such as solar, wind, or hydrogen. This would not only reduce the car's environmental impact but also make it more sustainable and cost-effective in the long run.",
    "**Car-Sharing Platform**: Create a platform that allows car owners to rent out their cars when they're not in use. This would reduce the number of cars on the road, decrease traffic congestion, and provide a flexible and affordable transportation option for people who don't own a car.",
    "**Autonomous Car Safety Features**: Develop advanced safety features that would make autonomous cars even safer. This could include improved collision avoidance systems, better navigation, and the ability to detect and respond to road hazards.",
    "**Car-Based Public Transportation**: Design a car that can transform into a small, mobile public transportation vehicle. This would allow it to serve as a shuttle bus or taxi service in areas with high demand for transportation.",
    "**Car Maintenance Predictive System**: Develop a system that can predict when a car needs maintenance. This could be based on data collected from the car's sensors and could alert the driver when a problem is detected, allowing for proactive maintenance."
