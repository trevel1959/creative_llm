    "**Enhanced Hand Washing Techniques**: Hygiene starts with proper hand washing. Educating yourself and others on the correct technique (for at least 20 seconds, using warm water and soap) can significantly reduce the spread of germs. You might consider investing in reusable antibacterial wipes or gels as an alternative.",
    "**Cloth Reusables**: Instead of single-use paper towels and wipes, opt for reusable cloths made from materials like cotton, microfiber, or bamboo. These can be washed and reused multiple times. They're not only more environmentally friendly but also cost-effective in the long run.",

Using natural air purifiers like plants such as spider plants, peace lilies, and snake plants, which are known for their ability to filter out pollutants, can help maintain indoor air quality. Additionally, DIY air filters using activated carbon can be effective."
