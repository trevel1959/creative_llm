    "**Ergonomic Handle**: Develop a garden hose with an adjustable, ergonomic handle that can be customized to fit different hand sizes and shapes. This would reduce fatigue and discomfort for gardeners, allowing them to work for extended periods without strain. The handle could also be designed with built-in grip textures or rubberized coatings for improved traction.",
    "**Water-Saving Nozzle**: Create a nozzle attachment for the garden hose that uses advanced aerodynamics to create a high-pressure jet of water while minimizing water waste. This nozzle could be equipped with a built-in flow meter, allowing gardeners to track their water usage in real-time. The nozzle could also be designed with a self-cleaning mechanism to prevent clogs and mineral buildup.",
    "**Solar-Powered Pump**: Develop a garden hose with a built-in solar-powered pump that eliminates the need for electricity. This would make the hose perfect for gardeners who live in areas with frequent power outages or those who want to reduce their carbon footprint. The pump could be designed with a rechargeable battery for use during periods of low sunlight.",
    "**Self-Cleaning System**: Design a garden hose with a built-in self-cleaning system that uses a combination of water jets and UV light to remove dirt, debris, and bacteria from the hose's interior. This would reduce the need for frequent hose cleanings and minimize the risk of waterborne pathogens.",
    "**Garden Hose Cart**: Create a compact, foldable cart that allows gardeners to easily transport and store their garden hose. The cart could be designed with built-in wheels, a secure hose holder, and a storage compartment for other gardening tools. This would make it easy to move the hose around the garden without straining the back or losing track of it."
