    "Safety: Safety is a major concern when it comes to creating a robot. How can it be programmed to handle potentially dangerous situations, such as handling hazardous materials or performing high-risk tasks? How will it be designed to protect itself and its human operators in case of an accident? How will it react to unexpected situations?",
    "Privacy: Robots can collect a vast amount of personal data as they interact with humans. How will this data be protected from unauthorized access or misuse? How will the robot's movements and actions be monitored in public spaces?",
    "Maintenance: Robot maintenance can be expensive and time-consuming. How will maintenance procedures be established and performed on a routine basis? How will any technical issues be identified and resolved?",
    "Legal implications: As robots become more sophisticated and capable, they may carry out tasks that previously only humans could do. This raises legal questions about liability and accountability in case of an accident or harm caused by the robot.",
    "Cost: The cost of developing and manufacturing a robot can be high. How will the cost be justified in terms of the benefits and applications of the robot?"
