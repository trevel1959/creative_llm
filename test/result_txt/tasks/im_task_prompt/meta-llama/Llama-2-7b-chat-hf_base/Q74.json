    "A Smart Watering Can: Create a watering can that can detect the soil moisture levels and automatically adjust the water flow accordingly. This can be done by incorporating a small sensor and a microcontroller inside the can. When the soil is dry, the sensor will detect it and send a signal to the microcontroller, which will then open the valve to release the right amount of water. This will ensure that the plants receive the right amount of water without over or under-watering.",
    "A Glow-in-the-Dark Watering Can: Create a watering can that emits a soft, gentle glow in the dark. This can be achieved by adding a small LED light source and a battery pack inside the can. This will not only make the watering can more aesthetically pleasing but also provide a convenient way to find the can in the dark, especially for those who tend to their gardens in the early morning or late evening.",
    "A Self-Watering Watering Can: Design a watering can that can self-water plants on its own. This can be done by adding a small water reservoir inside the can and a siphon system that can transfer water from the reservoir to the spout. When the water level in the reservoir gets low, the siphon system will automatically activate and refill the reservoir with water from the top. This will eliminate the need for manual watering and make it easier to maintain a consistent watering schedule.",
    "A Watering Can with Built-In Fertilizer Dispenser: Create a watering can that can dispense fertilizer along with water. This can be achieved by adding a small compartment inside the can that can hold the fertilizer. When the water is poured into the can, the fertilizer will automatically dispense through the spout. This will save time and effort in manually applying fertilizer to plants.",
    "A Watering Can with a Built-In Pest Repellent: Design a watering can that can repel pests such as mosquitoes and ants. This can be achieved by adding a small amount of a natural pest repellent, such as citronella oil, inside the can. When water is poured into the can, the citronella oil will mix with the water and emit a"
