    "**Play-Based Diplomacy**: International relations could take on a playful twist, with negotiations taking place in the form of games or sports rather than formal meetings. Treaties might be signed after a friendly soccer match or a round of video games, fostering a spirit of camaraderie and fun. While this could reduce tension and promote peace, it might also overlook serious issues that require more structured dialogue and analysis.",
    "**Radical Environmentalism**: Children are often more aware of and concerned about environmental issues than adults. A world ruled by children might see an aggressive push for sustainable practices, like banning single-use plastics and implementing mandatory recycling programs. However, their idealistic approaches might clash with economic realities, potentially leading to backlash from industries that are slow to adapt to such changes.",
    "**Simplified Governance**: Governance could become drastically simplified, with laws reduced to straightforward principles like “no fighting” or “everyone gets a turn.” While this could lead to a more equitable society, it may also result in the oversimplification of complex issues, leading to challenges in areas like justice and economic management, where nuance is crucial.",
    "**Educational Revolution**: The education system would likely undergo a transformation, with a focus on experiential learning and curiosity-driven exploration. Traditional subjects might be replaced by classes on topics like \"How to Build the Best Treehouse\" or \"Understanding Animal Communication.\" While this could foster a love for learning, it might also create gaps in essential knowledge and skills that are necessary for adult life.",
    "**Social Media Governance**: Children are digital natives, and their rule might see the rise of social media as a primary means of governance. Decisions could be made through online polls or trending hashtags, leading to a highly democratic yet chaotic system. While this could increase participation and engagement, it may also lead to the dangers of mob mentality and the influence of viral misinformation."
