    "Insect Repellent Plants: One creative solution to deal with pests like insects if all animals disappeared is to cultivate insect repellent plants. These plants have natural oils that repel or kill insects, providing a safe and sustainable solution. For example, lavender, basil, and mint are known to repel mosquitoes, while citronella and lemongrass can keep away ants and other insects. By planting these species in gardens or indoor pots, humans can enjoy a pest-free environment without harming the ecosystem.",
    "Insect-Proof Housing: Another innovative idea is to design and build insect-proof housing. This could involve using materials that are impermeable to insects, such as metal or plastic, and incorporating features like screens, windows, and doors with fine mesh screens to prevent insects from entering. This would provide a safe and secure environment for humans without the need for harmful pesticides or other chemicals.",
    "Insect-Friendly Architecture: Insects play a crucial role in pollination and nutrient cycling, so it's essential to create a harmonious relationship between humans and insects. One way to achieve this is by designing buildings and homes that are insect-friendly. For example, architects can incorporate features like bug hotels, bee bricks, and butterfly gardens into building designs to provide a habitat for beneficial insects. This not only promotes biodiversity but also helps to maintain a balance in the ecosystem.",
    "Insect-Based Food Systems: If all animals disappeared, humans would need to find alternative sources of protein. One creative solution is to utilize insects as a food source. Insects like crickets, mealworms, and grasshoppers are high in protein and can be farmed sustainably. Insect-based food systems could provide a nutritious and environmentally-friendly alternative to traditional livestock farming. Additionally, insects could be used as a supplement in traditional food systems, enriching the nutritional value of meals without the need for additional land or resources.",
