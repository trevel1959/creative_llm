    "**Multi-Function Griddle Plate**: Design a sandwich toaster that includes interchangeable griddle plates, allowing users to not only toast sandwiches but also cook eggs, pancakes, or other breakfast items simultaneously. The plates could be non-stick and dishwasher safe, making cleanup easy. This would transform the toaster into a versatile breakfast station.",
    "**Built-in Recipe Guide**: Create a sandwich toaster with an integrated touchscreen display that features a library of sandwich recipes. Users could browse through various options, select a recipe, and the toaster would provide step-by-step instructions, including ingredient suggestions and cooking times. This feature could also allow users to submit their own recipes and share them with the community.",
    "**Adjustable Thickness Compartment**: Introduce an adjustable compartment that can accommodate various sandwich thicknesses. Users could easily modify the height of the grilling plates to fit everything from thin slices of bread to thick artisanal loaves or stuffed sandwiches. This flexibility would make the toaster more versatile for different sandwich styles.",
    "**Flavor Infusion Technology**: Develop a sandwich toaster that uses a flavor infusion system, where users can add herbs, spices, or oils to a designated compartment. As the sandwich cooks, the toaster would release these flavors into the sandwich, enhancing the taste experience. This could be especially appealing for gourmet sandwiches and allow for customization.",
    "**Self-Cleaning Mechanism**: Implement a self-cleaning feature that uses steam or a specialized cleaning cycle to remove food residue and grease from the toaster plates. This could save users time and effort in maintaining their appliance. The self-cleaning function could be activated after cooking, ensuring that the toaster is always ready for the next use."
