    "Use a pollinator drone: Develop a drone that can fly around and pollinate plants. The drone would be equipped with pollen-filled compartments that it can release onto the stigma of the flower. This could be a viable option for pollinating crops in large fields.",
    "Use a pollinator robot: Develop a robot that can move around and pollinate plants. The robot would be equipped with a small arm that can pick up pollen from one flower and transfer it to the stigma of another flower. This could be a viable option for pollinating crops inable to move on their own.",
    "Use a pollinator drone with a camera: Develop a drone that can fly around and pollinate plants. The drone would be equipped with a camera that can capture images of the flowers. The images can be analyzed to determine the best time to pollinate the plants. This could be a viable option for pollinating crops in large fields.",
    "Use a pollinator robot with a GPS: Develop a robot that can move around and pollinate plants. The robot would be equipped with a GPS system that can help it navigate the field. This could be a viable option for pollinating crops in large fields.",
    "Use a pollinator drone with a pollen dispenser: Develop a drone that can fly around and pollinate plants. The drone would be equipped with a pollen dispenser that can release pollen onto the stigma of the flower. This could be a viable option for pollinating crops in large fields."
