    "**Innovative Closet Organizer**: Create a multi-level hanger that can hold various types of clothing like shirts, pants, dresses, and accessories. Each level can be adjusted to accommodate different clothing items, and the hanger itself could have clips or hooks for belts, scarves, and jewelry. This not only maximizes space but also keeps everything organized and easily accessible.",
    "**Interactive Hanger Display Stand**: Design a clothes hanger that doubles as a display stand for online stores. The hanger would be connected to a small digital screen that shows product details, reviews, and even videos of how to style the item. This enhances the shopping experience by providing more information at a glance and making the online shopping process more engaging.",
    "**Smart Hanger for Smart Homes**: Integrate a smart hanger into home automation systems. The hanger could sense when an item is removed from it and automatically adjust room lighting or play music to set the right mood for the activity (e.g., getting dressed in the morning). It could also sync with personal calendars, reminding users when itâ€™s time to change their wardrobe based on weather forecasts or upcoming events.",
    "**Recycled Material Hangers**: Develop a line of eco-friendly hangers made from recycled materials such as reclaimed wood, plastic bottles, or paper. These hangers can be designed in unique shapes and sizes to add a decorative element to any closet while promoting sustainability. They could also be made biodegradable to reduce environmental impact.",
    "**Personalized Hanger Engraving Service**: Offer a service where customers can personalize their clothes hangers with names, initials, or designs. This adds a personalized touch to everyday items, making them feel more unique and cherished. The hangers could come in various colors, materials, and styles to match different wardrobes and preferences."
