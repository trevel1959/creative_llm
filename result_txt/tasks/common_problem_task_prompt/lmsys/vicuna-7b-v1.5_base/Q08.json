    "Resistance from teachers: Another potential problem is that some teachers may resist the new curriculum, either because they are not comfortable with the new material or because they feel that it is too difficult for their students. This resistance can manifest in a variety of ways, such as refusing to teach the new curriculum or actively undermining it.",
    "Insufficient resources: A new curriculum may require new textbooks, equipment, or other resources that the school may not have the budget for. This can lead to a lack of resources for teachers and students, which can negatively impact the implementation of the new curriculum.",
    "Inadequate support for students: The new curriculum may require more support for students, such as additional tutoring or mentoring. If the school does not have the resources to provide this support, it can negatively impact the implementation of the new curriculum.",
    "Difficulty aligning with existing assessments: The new curriculum may not align well with existing assessments, which can make it difficult to measure student learning and progress. This can make it difficult to determine whether the new curriculum is effective or not.",
    "Lack of parental support: Parents may not be aware of the new curriculum or may not understand it. This can lead to a lack of support for the new curriculum, which can negatively impact its implementation."
