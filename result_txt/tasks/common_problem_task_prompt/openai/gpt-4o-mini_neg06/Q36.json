    "**Aesthetic Disputes**: The installation of solar panels can alter the visual appearance of homes and neighborhoods. This might lead to disputes among homeowners regarding what is considered aesthetically pleasing. Some residents may resist installations that they believe detract from the character of their homes or the neighborhood, potentially leading to community divisions or even legal challenges.",
    "**Zoning and Permitting Issues**: Each city has its own zoning laws and permitting processes that can complicate the installation of solar panels. Navigating these regulations can be time-consuming and may result in delays or even denial of permits. Homeowners might also face unexpected costs associated with obtaining the necessary approvals, creating frustration and financial strain.",
    "**Financial Accessibility**: While solar panels can reduce energy costs in the long run, the initial investment can be prohibitive for some homeowners. Without adequate financing options or government incentives, lower-income families may be excluded from participating in the solar initiative, exacerbating socioeconomic disparities within the city.",
    "**Interconnection Challenges**: Integrating solar panels into the existing power grid can present technical challenges. If the grid is not adequately equipped to handle the influx of decentralized solar energy, it could lead to reliability issues, blackouts, or even damage to the grid infrastructure. This necessitates significant investment in upgrades and maintenance.",
    "**Maintenance and Repair Responsibilities**: Once solar panels are installed, homeowners may not fully understand their responsibilities for maintenance and repairs. This lack of knowledge could lead to neglected panels, reduced efficiency, and potential safety hazards. Additionally, if the installation company goes out of business, homeowners might struggle to find reliable service providers for ongoing support."
