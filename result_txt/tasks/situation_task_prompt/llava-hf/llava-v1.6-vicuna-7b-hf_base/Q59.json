    "Install a solar concentrator: Use a solar concentrator system that focuses sunlight using mirrors and lenses to increase the intensity of the sunlight entering the building. This would allow you to use a smaller area of the roof for solar panels, maximizing the amount of sunlight entering the building.",
    "Use a combination of natural and artificial lighting: Install a combination of natural and artificial lighting sources, such as skylights, windows, and LED lighting. This would provide a consistent source of light throughout the day, even on cloudy days when natural light is scarce.",
    "Create a green roof: Cover the roof with a layer of plants and soil to create a green roof. Plants can absorb and convert sunlight into energy through the process of photosynthesis, providing a natural source of energy for the building. This would also improve insulation and reduce the building's overall energy consumption.",
    "Use a magnifying glass: Use a magnifying glass to focus and concentrate the sunlight entering the building. This would allow you to use a smaller area of the roof for solar panels and increase the intensity of the sunlight entering the building.",
    "Install a light tube: Install a light tube on the roof, which is a long, transparent tube filled with light-reflective materials. The light tube would capture and reflect sunlight, providing natural light inside the building even on cloudy days."
