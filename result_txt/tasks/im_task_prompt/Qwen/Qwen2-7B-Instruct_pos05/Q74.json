    "**Rainwater Harvesting System**: You can create a system where a large barrel or tank is placed under a downspout from your roof gutter. This allows rainwater to be collected and then directed into a watering can for use in your garden. The water collected this way is often cleaner than tap water as it has passed through the natural filtration process of the leaves on your roof.",
    "**Solar-Powered Watering Can**: Design a watering can that integrates solar panels directly onto its handle or body. The energy harvested from sunlight can be used to power a small pump inside the can, which can then be used to water plants without the need for manual lifting or effort. This not only makes watering more convenient but also helps in reducing energy consumption.",
    "**Smart Watering Can**: Incorporate sensors into the watering can that monitor soil moisture levels and plant health. The can could be programmed to release water only when needed based on these conditions, ensuring efficient use of water and preventing over-watering. It could also alert you via a mobile app when plants require water, making gardening more sustainable and less time-consuming.",
    "**Biodegradable Watering Can**: Develop a watering can made from biodegradable materials such as cornstarch, which decomposes quickly after use. This would reduce waste and environmental impact. Additionally, you could add a feature where the can is designed to break down even faster when exposed to sunlight or heat, further enhancing its eco-friendliness.",
    "**Interactive Watering Can**: Create a watering can that doubles as an interactive learning tool for children. It could have embedded educational content about different types of plants, their water needs, and how much water each type requires. Through an accompanying app, kids can scan the can to learn about the plants they are watering, making gardening an educational and fun activity for them."
