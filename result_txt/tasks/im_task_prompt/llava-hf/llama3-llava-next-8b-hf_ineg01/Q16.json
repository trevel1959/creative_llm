    "Hair Health Monitoring: The hairbrush could include a small sensor that detects the moisture content of the hair, alerting users when their hair is dry or over-conditioned. This could be particularly useful for individuals with oily or dry hair.",
    "Multitasking Tool: The hairbrush could be designed with interchangeable attachments, such as a wide-tooth comb for detangling, a fine-tooth comb for precise styling, and a massaging brush for scalp stimulation."
