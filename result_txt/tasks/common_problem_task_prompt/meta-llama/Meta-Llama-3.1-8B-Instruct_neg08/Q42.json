    "**Communication Breakdown**: With a large team of researchers involved, there is a high risk of miscommunication or misunderstandings. This could lead to confusion about the experiment's objectives, procedures, or results. The team might struggle to coordinate their efforts, leading to inefficiencies and errors.",
    "**Participant Attrition**: If the experiment involves human participants, there is a risk that some may drop out or refuse to continue. This could be due to various reasons such as discomfort, lack of interest, or even fear of the unknown. The loss of participants could compromise the validity and reliability of the results.",
    "**Data Quality Issues**: The quality of the data collected during the experiment could be compromised due to various reasons such as equipment malfunction, human error, or even data corruption. This could lead to inaccurate or unreliable results, which could undermine the entire experiment.",
    "**Regulatory Compliance**: Large-scale scientific experiments often involve working with sensitive or hazardous materials, which are subject to strict regulations and guidelines. Failure to comply with these regulations could result in serious consequences, including fines, penalties, or even damage to the reputation of the researchers and their institution.",
    "**Logistical Challenges**: Conducting a large-scale scientific experiment often requires significant resources, including equipment, personnel, and funding. The logistical challenges of managing these resources could be overwhelming, especially if the experiment involves working in a remote or hard-to-reach location."
