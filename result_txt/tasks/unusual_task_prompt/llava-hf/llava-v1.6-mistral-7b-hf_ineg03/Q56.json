    "**Astronomy Photography**: A camera with a high-quality zoom and a long exposure mode can be used for capturing images of celestial bodies like stars, planets, and the moon. This can be achieved by attaching the camera to a telescope or using a specialized mount to track the movement of the stars.",
    "**Thermal Imaging**: A camera equipped with an infrared sensor can be used for capturing thermal images, which can reveal heat patterns and invisible structures. This can be used for various applications like detecting heat loss in buildings, monitoring wildlife, or even for search and rescue operations.",
    "**3D Photography**: Some cameras come with built-in 3D sensors that can capture images in 3D format. This can be used for creating 3D models of objects or environments, which can be viewed with 3D glasses or used in virtual reality applications.",
    "**Time-Lapse Photography**: A camera can be used to capture time-lapse sequences, which show the changes in a scene over time. This can be used for weather tracking, monitoring plant growth, or even for artistic purposes.",
    "**Infrared Photography**: Infrared cameras can capture images in the infrared spectrum, which is invisible to the human eye. This can be used for applications like detecting wildfires, monitoring crops, or even for surveillance purposes."
