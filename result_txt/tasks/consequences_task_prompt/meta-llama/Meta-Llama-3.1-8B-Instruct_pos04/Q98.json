    "**Revival Clinics**: A network of secret underground clinics where scientists have developed a way to revive individuals who have passed away. The clinics are equipped with advanced technology and a team of experts who can revive people with a high success rate. However, the process is expensive, and only those who can afford it can get their loved ones back. The revived individuals often struggle to adjust to the modern world, leading to a new form of social isolation.",
    "**Ghost Workers**: In a world where people can be revived, a new class of workers emerges. These \"ghost workers\" are revived individuals who are hired to perform tasks that are too dangerous or time-consuming for living people. They work in hazardous industries, such as mining or construction, and are often treated poorly by their employers. The ghost workers are forced to live in a state of limbo, existing between life and death.",
    "**The Revival Trade**: A black market emerges where people can buy and sell revived individuals. The revived are often used as slaves, forced to work in inhumane conditions. The trade is fueled by a desire for cheap labor and a disregard for human life. A group of rebels must fight against the trade, using their skills and resources to free the revived and bring justice to those responsible.",
    "**The Revival Paradox**: A scientist discovers a way to revive people, but the process creates a paradox. Each time a person is revived, they are brought back to a different point in their past, creating a branching timeline. The scientist must navigate the complex web of timelines, trying to prevent a catastrophic future from unfolding. Along the way, they discover that the revived individuals are not the same people they once were, and that their memories and experiences are changing with each revival.",
    "**The Memory Keepers**: A group of people are tasked with preserving the memories of the revived. They are trained to extract and record the memories of the revived, creating a vast repository of human experience. However, as they delve deeper into the memories, they begin to realize that the revived are not just recalling their past, but also influencing the present. The memory keepers must navigate the blurred lines between reality and memory, trying to understand the true nature of human experience. [/INST] "
