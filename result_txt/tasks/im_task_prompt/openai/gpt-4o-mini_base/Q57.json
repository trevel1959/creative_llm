    "**Integrated Touchscreen Panel**: Enhance the mouse by incorporating a small touchscreen panel on its surface. This panel could serve multiple functions, such as displaying customizable shortcuts, notifications, or even allowing users to draw or write directly on it. This feature would provide a more interactive experience, enabling users to quickly access tools or applications without needing to move to the keyboard.",
    "**Gesture Control and Motion Sensors**: Implement advanced gesture control technology into the mouse, allowing users to perform commands with hand movements. For example, users could swipe their hand above the mouse to scroll through documents or rotate their wrist to switch between applications. This would provide a more intuitive way to navigate digital environments and reduce reliance on traditional clicking.",
    "**Smart Tracking Technology**: Develop a mouse that uses AI-powered tracking technology to adapt to different surfaces. It could automatically adjust its sensitivity and speed based on the texture and reflectivity of the surface it’s on, ensuring precise control whether on a desk, a couch, or even a bed. This would enhance usability for remote workers or those who frequently change their workspace.",
    "**Multi-Device Connectivity**: Create a mouse that can seamlessly connect to multiple devices (laptops, tablets, smartphones) via Bluetooth or Wi-Fi. Users could switch between devices with a simple button press or gesture, allowing for fluid transitions in a multi-device environment. This feature would cater to the growing trend of working across different platforms without the hassle of reconnecting.",
    "**Built-in Rechargeable Battery with Solar Charging**: Design a mouse with a built-in rechargeable battery that can be charged not only via USB but also through solar energy. This would allow users to place the mouse in sunlight to keep it charged during use, reducing reliance on power outlets and contributing to sustainability efforts. A battery level indicator could also be included to notify users when it’s time to recharge."
