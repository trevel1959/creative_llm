Neighbors would band together to create a network of support, sharing knowledge and resources to maintain their health. They would establish a system of peer-to-peer care, where individuals with specific skills or expertise would offer their services to others.

This approach would not only reduce reliance on external sources but also promote innovation and self-sufficiency.",
    "**Environmental Health Initiatives**: In the absence of traditional medical facilities, environmental health initiatives would take on a new level of importance.
