    "**Self-Winding Leash**: Design a dog leash that automatically retracts and winds itself when the dog is close to the owner. This can be achieved using a small motor that senses the distance between the dog and the owner, allowing for hands-free walking and preventing the leash from dragging on the ground or getting tangled.",
    "**Interactive Leash with Training Features**: Develop a leash that incorporates training features such as a clicker and vibration alerts. This leash can provide feedback to the dog during walks, rewarding them with vibrations for good behavior or a click sound for commands. The leash could also include a small treat compartment for positive reinforcement.",
    "**Leash with Built-in Water Bottle and Bowl**: Create a leash that has a detachable water bottle and collapsible bowl for hydration on the go. This would be especially useful for long walks or hikes, ensuring that dogs stay hydrated without the need to carry extra gear. The bottle could be designed to fit snugly in the leash handle for easy access.",
    "**Adjustable Length Leash**: Introduce a leash that allows users to easily adjust the length with a simple mechanism. This could include a sliding lock system that lets you choose between short, medium, or long lengths depending on the environment (e.g., crowded areas vs. open spaces). The leash could also have markings to indicate the length for consistent use.",
    "**Reflective and LED-Integrated Leash**: Design a leash that incorporates reflective materials and LED lights for nighttime visibility. The leash could have a setting that allows it to flash or glow continuously, making it easier for drivers and other pedestrians to see you and your dog during evening walks, enhancing safety."
