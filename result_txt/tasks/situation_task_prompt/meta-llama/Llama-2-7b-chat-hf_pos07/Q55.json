    "Citizen Journalism: With the disappearance of televisions, people could take up the mantle of reporting news and events happening in their communities. This could be done through social media platforms, blogs, or even community newsletters. By sharing their experiences and observations, individuals could create a decentralized network of local news sources, providing a more diverse and inclusive perspective on current events.",
    "Audio News Podcasts: In the absence of visual media, people could turn to audio news podcasts for their daily dose of news and information. These podcasts could be produced by individuals, organizations, or even communities, providing a platform for people to share their voices and perspectives. With the rise of smart speakers and voice-activated devices, listening to news podcasts could become more convenient than ever.",
    "Community Bulletins: To keep up with local news and events, communities could create their own bulletins or newsletters. These could be distributed through physical means, such as door-to-door delivery or community centers, or through digital means, such as email or messaging apps. By sharing information on local happenings, these bulletins could help foster a sense of community and connection among neighbors.",
    "Mobile Apps: Developers could create mobile apps that aggregate news from various sources, making it easier for people to stay informed on the go. These apps could use AI-powered algorithms to curate news based on individual preferences, providing a personalized news feed for each user. With the rise of mobile devices, these apps could become an essential tool for staying informed in a world without televisions.",
    "Interactive Online Forums: In the absence of television, people could turn to online forums and discussion boards to engage in conversations about current events. These forums could be moderated by community members or by professional moderators, ensuring that discussions remain respectful and constructive. By fostering a culture of dialogue and exchange, these forums could help build a more informed and empathetic society."
