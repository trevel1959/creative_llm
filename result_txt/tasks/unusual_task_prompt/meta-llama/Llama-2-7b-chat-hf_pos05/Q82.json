    "Clothes Iron with Built-in Steam: Create an iron with a built-in steam function that can be triggered by a button or sensor. This would allow users to quickly and easily remove wrinkles and creases from their clothes without having to use a separate steamer. The steam function could be powered by a small heating element or by harnessing the heat generated by the ironing process itself.",
    "Smart Clothes Iron with Temperature Control: Develop an iron with a built-in temperature control system that allows users to adjust the heat setting based on the type of fabric they are ironing. This would ensure that delicate fabrics are not damaged by excessive heat, while tougher fabrics can be ironed at a higher temperature. The temperature control system could be achieved through a touchscreen display or voice commands.",
    "Portable Clothes Iron with Solar Power: Design an iron that can be powered by solar energy, making it perfect for camping or travel. The iron could have a detachable solar panel that can be placed in direct sunlight to charge the built-in battery. This would eliminate the need for electricity or batteries, making it a more eco-friendly and convenient option for ironing on the go.",
    "Clothes Iron with Heat-Resistant Coating: Develop an iron with a heat-resistant coating that can protect the fabric from scorching and burning. The coating could be made from a durable material such as silicone or ceramic, and could be applied to the soleplate or the entire iron. This would ensure that users can iron their clothes safely and without worrying about damage to the fabric.",
    "Automatic Clothes Iron with Sensor Technology: Create an iron that can automatically detect the type of fabric being ironed and adjust the heat and steam settings accordingly. The iron could be equipped with sensors that can detect the moisture content of the fabric, the fabric's thickness, and its texture. This would ensure that the iron provides the optimal settings for each type of fabric, resulting in faster and more efficient ironing. The sensors could be connected to a smartphone app that provides real-time feedback and recommendations for ironing."
