    "**Eco-Friendly Wedding Dress Design Challenge**: Organize a global design competition where participants create unique, sustainable wedding dresses using recycled materials. This could involve using items like old textiles, reclaimed wood, or natural dyes. The winner's design could then be produced for the event, providing an eco-conscious option for brides looking to minimize their environmental impact.",
    "**Eco-Village Wedding Venue**: Partner with an existing eco-village or help establish one specifically for your event. These venues typically feature sustainable architecture, use renewable energy sources, and have minimal environmental impact. Guests can enjoy activities like hiking, organic farming tours, and workshops on sustainable living practices, making the entire experience more engaging and educational.",
    "**Zero-Waste Catering**: Hire caterers who specialize in zero-waste cuisine, focusing on local, seasonal ingredients and minimizing food waste through creative plating techniques. Use compostable tableware and offer a menu that includes plant-based options, which generally have lower carbon footprints than meat-heavy dishes. Encourage guests to bring their reusable water bottles by setting up water stations with filtered water throughout the venue.",
    "**Sustainable Transportation Options**: Arrange shuttle services powered by electric or hybrid vehicles to transport guests from various locations to the wedding venue. For longer distances, consider promoting carpooling among guests or offering incentives for those who arrive by bike or public transportation. This not only reduces emissions but also encourages a sense of community among attendees.",
    "**Eco-Themed Activities and Decor**: Incorporate natural elements into the wedding decor, such as using potted plants, flowers from local nurseries, and biodegradable decorations. Offer interactive activities like planting trees, seedling giveaways, or a DIY recycling station where guests can learn about upcycling and recycling techniques. These elements can serve as a lasting reminder of the coupleâ€™s commitment to sustainability."
