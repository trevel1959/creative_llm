    "**Bioluminescent Bees**: Develop genetically engineered bees that produce a glowing, UV light. This would allow them to communicate with each other and navigate through the dark, pollinating plants in the absence of sunlight. The bioluminescence would also attract other beneficial insects, creating a network of pollinators. Confidence: 0.8",
    "**Magnetic Pollinators**: Create microorganisms that can sense and respond to magnetic fields, allowing them to navigate and pollinate plants. These microorganisms could be engineered to produce a magnetic signature, attracting other pollinators and creating a self-sustaining ecosystem. Confidence: 0.7",
    "**Nano-Robots**: Design and deploy nano-robots that can navigate through plant tissue, collecting and transporting pollen between flowers. These robots would be powered by solar energy and equipped with advanced sensors to detect and respond to plant signals. Confidence: 0.9",
    "**Atmospheric Pollen Dispersion**: Develop a system that uses advanced aerodynamics and atmospheric manipulation to disperse pollen from a central location. This could involve creating a network of drones or wind turbines that generate targeted air currents, simulating the natural pollination process. Confidence: 0.6",
    "**Synthetic Pollen**: Engineer microorganisms to produce synthetic pollen that can be used to pollinate plants. This synthetic pollen would be designed to mimic the natural process, attracting pollinators and facilitating plant reproduction. Confidence: 0.5"
