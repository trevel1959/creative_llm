    "Use ancient artifacts and inscriptions: Given that books are the primary source of knowledge, the disappearance of books would leave a significant gap in human understanding. To fill this gap, people could turn to ancient artifacts and inscriptions that have been preserved over time. These artifacts could provide valuable information about history, culture, and science. For instance, the Rosetta Stone, which is an ancient Egyptian artifact inscribed with the same text in three languages, could be used to decipher ancient languages and unlock their secrets. Similarly, ancient cave paintings and carvings could provide insight into the beliefs and practices of early human societies.",

    "Employ mind-reading technology: In a world without books, people could use advanced mind-reading technology to gain knowledge directly from the minds of others. This technology could involve using brain-computer interfaces or other forms of neurotechnology to read and interpret the thoughts and memories of individuals. By tapping into the collective knowledge of a group of people, individuals could gain a comprehensive understanding of a particular subject without the need for written records.",
    "Develop new forms of writing: In the absence of books, people could develop new forms of writing that are more durable and accessible than traditional paper-based writing. For example, they could use digital ink or other forms of electronic writing that are more resistant to damage and decay. Additionally, they could use augmented reality technologies to project written content onto physical objects or environments, creating a new form of interactive and immersive writing.",
    "Create virtual libraries: Given the loss of physical books, people could create virtual libraries that exist solely in the digital realm. These libraries could be accessed through virtual reality or"
