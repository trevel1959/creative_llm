    "**Hoverbikes**: In a future where roads are obsolete, hoverbikes could become the norm. These electric-powered vehicles can fly and land vertically, making them ideal for navigating over obstacles and through urban landscapes. They would be a popular choice for both personal transportation and delivery services.",
    "**Subterranean Tunnels**: If all roads disappeared, underground tunnels could be built to connect different parts of the city. These tunnels would be equipped with advanced infrastructure, such as high-speed trains and autonomous vehicles, to ensure efficient and fast transportation.",
    "**Magnetic Trains**: In a city with no roads, magnetic trains could be used for public transportation. These trains would run on magnetic tracks embedded in the ground, allowing them to travel at high speeds and reduce travel times significantly.",
    "**Flying Drones**: Flying drones could be another option for moving around a city without roads. These drones could be used for both personal transportation and delivery services, offering a quick and efficient way to navigate through the urban landscape.",
    "**Underwater Tunnels**: If the city has a significant amount of water, underwater tunnels could be built to connect different parts of the city. These tunnels would be equipped with advanced infrastructure, such as water-resistant vehicles and advanced lighting systems, to ensure safe and efficient transportation."
