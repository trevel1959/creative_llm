    "Develop a mobile app that uses machine learning algorithms to help users make better decisions. The app could provide personalized recommendations based on a user's past behavior and preferences. For example, the app could suggest the best time to go shopping based on a user's shopping history, or recommend the best restaurant based on a user's food preferences. This could be a useful tool for anyone looking to make more informed decisions in their daily life."
