    "**Liability and Insurance**: As self-driving cars become more prevalent, there will be a need for new insurance products and regulations to address liability in the event of an accident. For example, if a self-driving car is involved in an accident, who is responsible â€“ the manufacturer, the owner, or the software developer? Insurance companies will need to adapt their policies to account for these new risks.",
    "**Employment Displacement**: The widespread adoption of self-driving cars could lead to job displacement in the transportation and delivery industries, as human drivers would no longer be needed. This could exacerbate unemployment rates and create new challenges for the workforce.",
    "**Ethical Considerations**: Self-driving cars raise ethical questions about how they should be programmed to make decisions in complex or emergency situations. For instance, should a self-driving car prioritize the safety of its passengers over pedestrians, or should it follow traffic rules even if it means a collision?",
    "**Regulatory Framework**: The rapid development of self-driving cars outpaces the ability of governments to create and enforce regulations. This could lead to a lack of standardization and potential safety hazards as manufacturers and software developers operate within different regulatory frameworks.",
    "**Maintenance and Repair**: As self-driving cars become more complex, the process of maintaining and repairing them may become more difficult. This could lead to increased costs for car owners and a shortage of qualified technicians."
