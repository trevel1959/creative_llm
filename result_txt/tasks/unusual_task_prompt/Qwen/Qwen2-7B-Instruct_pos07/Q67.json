    "**Portable Power Bank Flashlight**: Design a flashlight that doubles as a power bank to charge electronic devices. This could be especially useful during emergencies or outdoor activities where access to electricity is limited. The flashlight would have multiple USB ports for charging phones, tablets, or other gadgets, and could also have an emergency signal feature that uses the flashlight's brightness and flashing capabilities to alert rescuers.",
    "**Bioluminescent Plant Flashlight**: Create a flashlight that uses bioluminescent plants to generate light. These plants could be genetically engineered to produce light under certain conditions, such as low light levels. The flashlight would have compartments to house these plants, which would glow when activated. This could serve as a sustainable and eco-friendly alternative to traditional flashlights, reducing reliance on non-renewable energy sources.",
    "**Thermal Imaging Flashlight**: Develop a flashlight equipped with thermal imaging technology, allowing it to detect heat signatures in the dark. This would be invaluable for night-time hunting, search and rescue operations, or for security purposes. It could also be used in industrial settings for maintenance checks, detecting overheated machinery without direct contact.",
    "**Interactive Storytelling Flashlight**: Design a flashlight that integrates with a smartphone app to create an interactive storytelling experience. The flashlight would have buttons or a touchpad to navigate through stories, which could be educational, thrilling, or even interactive games. This could be particularly engaging for children, encouraging them to explore new narratives and enhance their imagination.",
    "**Augmented Reality (AR) Guided Flashlight**: Create a flashlight that combines AR technology with navigation tools. When pointed at landmarks or objects, the flashlight would display additional information about them via the AR interface of a connected device. This could be used for guided tours, museum exhibits, or even for exploring unfamiliar environments, offering real-time translations, historical facts, or interactive experiences."
