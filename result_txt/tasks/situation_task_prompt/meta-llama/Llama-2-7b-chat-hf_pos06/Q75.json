    "Solar Powered Vehicles: One creative solution to power vehicles if all the world's oil suddenly disappeared is to switch to solar-powered vehicles. These vehicles would be equipped with solar panels that would absorb sunlight and convert it into electricity, which would power the vehicle's motor. This would provide a clean and sustainable source of energy, reducing our reliance on fossil fuels and minimizing the impact on the environment. Confidence Score: 0.8/1",
    "Hydrogen Fuel Cells: Another creative solution to power vehicles is to use hydrogen fuel cells. These cells convert hydrogen into electricity, which can then be used to power electric motors. The only byproduct of this process is water vapor and heat, making it a clean and efficient source of energy. Additionally, hydrogen can be produced from renewable energy sources such as wind or solar power, further reducing the carbon footprint of transportation. Confidence Score: 0.9/1",
    "Electric Vehicle Charging Infrastructure: A third creative solution to power vehicles is to invest in electric vehicle charging infrastructure. This would involve building out a network of charging stations across the country, making it easier and more convenient for people to own and use electric vehicles. This would help to increase the adoption of electric vehicles, reducing the demand for fossil fuels and decreasing emissions. Confidence Score: 0.8/1",
    "Biofuels: Another creative solution to power vehicles is to use biofuels. These are fuels made from organic matter such as plants, algae, or agricultural waste. Biofuels can be used to power internal combustion engines, providing a clean and sustainable source of energy. Additionally, biofuels can be produced from renewable sources, reducing the carbon footprint of transportation. Confidence Score: 0.7/1",
    "Magnetic Levitation Transportation: A fifth creative solution to power vehicles is to use magnetic levitation transportation. This technology uses magnetic fields to levitate vehicles above the ground, eliminating the need for wheels and motors. This would provide a frictionless and efficient mode of transportation, reducing energy consumption and emissions. Additionally, magnetic levitation transportation could be powered by electricity, making it a clean and sust"
