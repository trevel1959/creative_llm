    "**Keyless Entry with Biometric Authentication**: Develop a car key that uses biometric authentication, such as a fingerprint scanner or facial recognition. This would eliminate the need for traditional keys and provide an added layer of security. Users could simply touch the key or look at it to unlock their car, making it more convenient and secure, especially in crowded parking lots.",
    "**Modular Key Design**: Create a modular car key that allows users to customize its functions. For instance, users could attach different modules for remote start, panic button, or even a personal safety alarm. This way, the key can be tailored to individual preferences and needs, ensuring that users have all the features they want in one compact design.",
    "**Eco-Friendly Key Material**: Innovate a car key made from sustainable materials, such as recycled plastics or biodegradable composites. This would appeal to environmentally conscious consumers and promote sustainability in the automotive industry. The design could also include a built-in solar panel to recharge any electronic components, reducing reliance on batteries.",
    "**Integrated NFC Payment System**: Incorporate an NFC (Near Field Communication) chip into the car key, allowing users to make payments directly from their keys. This could be particularly useful for tolls, parking meters, or even gas stations, providing a seamless experience without needing to pull out a wallet or phone. Users could manage their payment methods through a companion app.",
    "**Emergency Assistance Button**: Add a dedicated emergency assistance button to the car key that connects directly to emergency services or roadside assistance. In case of an accident or breakdown, users could quickly summon help without needing to fumble for their phone. The key could also include a small flashlight for added utility in dark situations."
