    "**Catastrophic Economic Impact**: The sudden shutdown of all electronic devices could lead to a complete halt in economic activities worldwide. Banks, stock exchanges, and financial systems heavily rely on digital infrastructure for transactions and operations. This would result in chaos as cash transactions become the only option, causing significant delays and potential shortages in supply chains.",
    "**Communication Disruption**: With all electronic devices stopping, communication networks would collapse. Mobile phones, internet services, and satellite communications would cease functioning, leading to widespread isolation and panic. Emergency services might struggle to communicate, impacting their ability to respond effectively to crises like natural disasters or medical emergencies.",
    "**Infrastructure Failure**: Many critical infrastructures such as power grids, traffic management systems, and water supply networks are managed by digital systems. Without electronic devices, these systems would fail, potentially causing blackouts, traffic jams, and disruptions in water supply, leading to public health concerns and safety issues.",
    "**Educational and Research Halt**: Educational institutions and research facilities that depend on electronic devices would be severely impacted. Students might revert to traditional learning methods, but this could lead to a significant delay in academic progress and innovation. Universities and laboratories would lose access to databases, simulations, and experimental equipment, halting ongoing research projects.",
    "**Social and Mental Impact**: The sudden absence of technology could lead to a collective sense of disorientation and fear among the population. Social interactions, entertainment, and daily routines would be drastically altered. This could result in mental health issues, including anxiety and depression, as people struggle to adapt to a world without their usual technological dependencies."
