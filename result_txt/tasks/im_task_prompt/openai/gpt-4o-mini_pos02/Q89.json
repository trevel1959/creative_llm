    "**Interchangeable Plate System**: Design a waffle iron with interchangeable plates that allow users to create various waffle shapes and sizes, such as heart-shaped, star-shaped, or even mini-waffles. This feature would make the waffle iron versatile for different occasions, like holidays or parties, and encourage creativity in the kitchen.",
    "**Integrated Toppings Dispenser**: Create a waffle iron that includes a built-in dispenser for toppings such as chocolate chips, nuts, or fruit. Users can fill the dispenser with their desired toppings, and as the batter cooks, the toppings are automatically released into the waffle. This ensures an even distribution of toppings and adds an exciting twist to traditional waffles.",
    "**Self-Cleaning Functionality**: Incorporate a self-cleaning mechanism using steam or a non-toxic cleaning solution that can be activated after cooking. This feature would make it easier for users to maintain their waffle iron without the hassle of scrubbing or scraping, promoting a more hygienic cooking experience.",
    "**Waffle Iron with Temperature Control and Indicators**: Introduce a waffle iron with precise temperature control and visual indicators. Users could set the exact temperature for different types of batters (e.g., gluten-free, protein-rich) and receive visual feedback (like LED lights) that changes color as the waffle cooks, indicating when it's perfectly done.",
    "**Multi-Layer Waffle Iron**: Innovate a multi-layer waffle iron that allows users to cook two or more layers of batter at once, creating stuffed waffles with fillings like Nutella, peanut butter, or cream cheese. This would enable users to explore new flavor combinations and textures, transforming the traditional waffle into a more decadent dessert or breakfast option."
