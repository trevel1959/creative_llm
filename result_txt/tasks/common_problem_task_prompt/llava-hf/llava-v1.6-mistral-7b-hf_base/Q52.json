    "Limited space: Another potential problem is the lack of space in the office for physical activities. Many offices are not designed with exercise in mind, and there may not be enough room to accommodate a group fitness class or other physical activities.",
    "Health and safety concerns: Implementing a fitness program in the office could also raise health and safety concerns, especially if employees are not used to exercising in a shared space. There is a risk of injury, and it is important to ensure that the program is safe and well-organized.",
    "Time constraints: Employees may have difficulty finding time to participate in the fitness program, especially if they have busy schedules or workloads. This could lead to low participation rates and dissatisfaction with the program.",
    "Limited resources: Implementing a fitness program may require additional resources, such as equipment, space, and staff. The office may not have the budget or resources to support the program, which could limit its effectiveness.",
    "Lack of support and accountability: Without adequate support and accountability, employees may not feel motivated to stick with the fitness program. This could lead to low participation rates and a lack of progress."
