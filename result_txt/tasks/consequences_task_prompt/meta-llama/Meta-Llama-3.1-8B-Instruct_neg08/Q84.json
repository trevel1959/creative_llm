    "**Language Barrier for Minority Groups**: The adoption of a single universal language could lead to the marginalization of minority groups who may not speak the dominant language. This could result in social isolation, reduced access to education and employment opportunities, and a loss of cultural identity.",
    "**Loss of Linguistic Innovation**: A single universal language could stifle linguistic innovation, as there would be less pressure to develop new languages and dialects.
