    "**Living Wall Systems**: Create vertical gardens or living walls inside your home. These walls can be planted with a variety of plants that not only improve air quality but also provide insulation. The moisture from the plants can help cool the air in the summer while the plantsâ€™ density offers an extra layer of warmth in the winter. Additionally, these walls can be designed to have built-in irrigation systems that can be controlled to optimize humidity levels.",
    "**Reflective Window Treatments**: Develop a series of window treatments that incorporate reflective materials or coatings. For example, curtains lined with aluminum foil or reflective mylar can bounce sunlight away in the summer, keeping rooms cooler, while heavier, insulated drapes can be used in winter to trap heat inside. This dual-purpose approach would allow homeowners to adjust their indoor climate based on the season.",
    "**Natural Ventilation Systems**: Install a series of strategically placed vents and operable windows to create a natural ventilation system that takes advantage of prevailing winds. By designing the layout of the home to promote cross-ventilation, cool breezes can flow through during hot days, while opening windows at night can allow cooler air to enter, reducing the need for mechanical cooling systems.",
    "**Heat-Absorbing Decor**: Use decor items that can help regulate temperature, such as thick, woolen rugs or tapestries that can absorb heat during the day and release it slowly at night. Incorporating these textiles into your interior design not only adds aesthetic value but also functions as an additional layer of insulation, helping to maintain a comfortable indoor environment.",
    "**DIY Evaporative Coolers**: Create a simple evaporative cooling system using a fan and a shallow pan of water. The fan can blow air over the water, causing evaporation, which cools the air before it enters the living space. This system can be enhanced by adding ice or frozen water bottles to the pan to increase the cooling effect, making it an efficient and low-cost alternative to air conditioning."
