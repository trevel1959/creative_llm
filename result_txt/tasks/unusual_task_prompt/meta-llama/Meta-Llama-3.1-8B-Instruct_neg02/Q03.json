    "**Eco-Friendly City**: Design a sustainable city made entirely from recycled cardboard boxes. The city would have towering skyscrapers, winding streets, and public spaces crafted from corrugated cardboard. Residents would live in cardboard homes, with each box carefully crafted to provide a unique and cozy living space. The city's infrastructure would be powered by solar panels and wind turbines, with a focus on minimizing waste and maximizing reuse. The cardboard city would serve as a model for eco-friendly urban planning, demonstrating the potential for creative reuse and recycling.",
    "**Cardboard Odyssey**: Create an immersive, interactive experience where participants embark on a fantastical journey through a cardboard world. The odyssey would begin with a cardboard boat, which would transport passengers through a winding, cardboard canal. Along the way, they'd encounter cardboard creatures, including towering cardboard trees, mischievous cardboard sprites, and even a cardboard dragon. Each stage of the journey would feature increasingly complex and fantastical cardboard constructions, culminating in a final showdown with the cardboard dragon.",
    "**Cardboard Carnival**: Host a vibrant, cardboard-themed carnival that celebrates the art of reuse and creativity. The carnival would feature a range of attractions, including a cardboard Ferris wheel, a cardboard funhouse, and a cardboard merry-go-round. Visitors would be encouraged to participate in cardboard crafts and workshops, where they could create their own cardboard creations. The carnival would also feature live music, food vendors, and a cardboard-themed photo booth.",
    "**Cardboard Archaeology**: Develop an interactive exhibit that explores the \"lost city\" of Cardboardia, a fictional civilization that thrived on a planet made entirely of cardboard. Visitors would be archaeologists tasked with uncovering the secrets of Cardboardia, navigating through a series of cardboard ruins, temples, and artifacts. Each discovery would reveal more about the culture, technology, and daily life of the Cardboardians, culminating in a final, epic reveal of the city's mysterious cardboard artifact.",
    "**Cardboard Cosmos**: Create a breathtaking, large-scale installation that transforms a public space into a cardboard universe. The installation would feature towering cardboard planets, swirling cardboard galaxies, and even a cardboard black hole. Visitors would be able to walk through the cardboard cosmos, exploring the intricacies of cardboard constellations and experiencing the beauty of cardboard's texture and pattern. The installation would be accompanied by an immersive soundscape, with cardboard-inspired music and sound effects.
