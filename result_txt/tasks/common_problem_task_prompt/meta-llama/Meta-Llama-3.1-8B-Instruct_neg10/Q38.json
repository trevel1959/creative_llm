    "**Casting Conundrum**: Finding the perfect cast for the movie could be a daunting task. Actors might not be available, or they might not be the right fit for their roles. I would research and shortlist potential actors, conduct thorough auditions, and be open to negotiating with talent agencies to secure the best cast for the film.",
    "**Scheduling Snares**: Coordinating the filming schedule could be a logistical nightmare, especially with multiple locations, special effects, and a large cast. I would create a detailed shooting schedule, prioritize scenes, and allocate sufficient time for rehearsals and setup to ensure a smooth filming process.",
    "**Budget Blowout**: The movie's budget could balloon out of control due to unexpected expenses, last-minute changes, or overruns on special effects. I would establish a realistic budget, track expenses closely, and make adjustments as needed to stay within the allocated funds.",
    "**Crew Conflict**: Managing a large crew can lead to conflicts, miscommunication, and a decrease in productivity. I would foster a positive and respectful work environment, establish clear communication channels, and provide opportunities for crew members to contribute their ideas and feedback.",
    "**Script Revision**: Revising the script could be a time-consuming and iterative process, especially if the story or characters require significant changes. I would work closely with the screenwriter, gather feedback from key stakeholders, and be open to making changes to ensure the final product meets the vision."
