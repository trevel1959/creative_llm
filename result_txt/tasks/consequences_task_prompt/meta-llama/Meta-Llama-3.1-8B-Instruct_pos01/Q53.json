    "**Rapid Plastic Degradation Revolution**: With plastic biodegrading as quickly as paper, the environmental impact of plastic waste would be drastically reduced. Landfills would no longer be overflowing with non-biodegradable plastic, and the amount of plastic waste in oceans would decrease significantly. This would lead to a massive reduction in greenhouse gas emissions from plastic decomposition. Additionally, the rapid degradation of plastic would create new economic opportunities for companies that specialize in biodegradable plastics and waste management. Confidence: 0.8",
    "**Biodegradable Infrastructure**: The rapid degradation of plastic would also lead to the development of biodegradable infrastructure, such as roads, buildings, and other construction materials. This would reduce the environmental impact of construction and demolition, as well as the need for costly repairs and replacements. Companies would invest in research and development of biodegradable materials, creating new industries and job opportunities. Confidence: 0.9",
    "**Closed-Loop Systems**: With plastic biodegrading as quickly as paper, companies would focus on designing closed-loop systems for plastic production and consumption. This would involve recycling, upcycling, and biodegrading plastic waste, reducing the need for virgin plastic production. Closed-loop systems would also create new business models and revenue streams for companies that specialize in plastic recycling and biodegradation. Confidence: 0.85",
    "**Biodegradable Packaging**: The rapid degradation of plastic would lead to a shift towards biodegradable packaging materials, such as plant-based plastics, paper-based packaging, or even edible packaging. This would reduce plastic waste and the environmental impact of packaging, while also creating new opportunities for companies that specialize in biodegradable packaging. Confidence: 0.8",
    "**New Forms of Art and Design**: With plastic biodegrading as quickly as paper, artists and designers would be inspired to create new forms of art and design that incorporate biodegradable materials. This would lead to a new wave of creative expression, as well as the development of new materials and technologies that combine art, design, and biodegradation. Confidence: 0.7"
