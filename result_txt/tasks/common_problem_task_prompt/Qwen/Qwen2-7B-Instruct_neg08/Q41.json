    "**Communication Delays**: Communication with Earth can be delayed by hours or even days due to the vast distances involved. This delay can create significant challenges for decision-making, especially during emergencies or critical operations like docking maneuvers.",
    "**Radiation Exposure**: Spaceships need protection against high levels of radiation encountered in space, such as solar flares and cosmic rays. Insufficient shielding could expose astronauts to harmful radiation levels, increasing the risk of cancer and other health issues.",
    "**Microgravity Effects**: Astronauts in a spaceship experience prolonged periods of microgravity, which can lead to bone density loss and muscle atrophy. Designing effective exercise regimes and maintaining a suitable living environment to minimize these effects is crucial.",
    "**Psychological Impact**: The isolation and confinement in a spaceship can have severe psychological impacts on crew members. This can manifest in stress, anxiety, and depression, potentially affecting team dynamics and overall mission success.",
    "**Thermal Management**: Ensuring adequate temperature control is essential for both the ship's components and the crew's well-being. Extreme temperatures in space (from freezing cold to scorching heat) pose a challenge for maintaining a stable internal environment."
