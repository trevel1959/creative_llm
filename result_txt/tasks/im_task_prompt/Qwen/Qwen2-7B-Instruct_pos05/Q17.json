    "**Innovative Laundry Sorting System**: Develop a smart washing machine equipped with advanced sensors that can automatically sort clothes by color, fabric type, and even dirt level. This system would use AI to learn from the user's preferences over time, optimizing sorting and cleaning processes for efficiency and effectiveness.",
    "**Smart Water Recycling System**: Integrate a water recycling system within the washing machine that captures and reuses water, significantly reducing water consumption. The recycled water can then be used for other household purposes like toilet flushing or garden irrigation, contributing to sustainable living.",
    "**Wearable Fabric Analysis and Customization**: Create a washing machine that can analyze the fabric of each item and recommend specific wash cycles, temperatures, and detergents tailored to the fabric's needs. This feature could also include suggestions for drying methods, enhancing the longevity and quality of clothing.",
    "**Energy-Efficient Pre-Cleaning System**: Design a pre-cleaning system that uses ultrasonic waves or steam to break down and remove dirt and stains before the actual wash cycle begins. This not only improves cleaning performance but also reduces energy usage as it requires less intensive cleaning during the main wash cycle.",
    "**Virtual Stylist Integration**: Incorporate a virtual stylist feature into the smart washing machine. Using augmented reality (AR) technology, the machine could provide style recommendations based on the user's wardrobe, helping them create new outfits and suggesting which items would pair well together after washing. This could enhance the user's fashion choices and encourage more creative styling options."
