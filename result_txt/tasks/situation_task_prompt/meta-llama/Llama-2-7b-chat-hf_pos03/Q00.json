    "Maglev trains: Magnetic levitation trains, also known as maglev trains, are a type of train that uses magnetic fields to lift and propel the train, eliminating the need for wheels and tracks. This technology already exists and could be used to create a high-speed transportation system that is both efficient and eco-friendly.",
    "Hoverbikes: Hoverbikes are a type of vehicle that uses fans or rotors to create lift and propulsion, allowing the rider to hover above the ground. With the help of advanced materials and technology, hoverbikes could become a practical mode of transportation, especially for short distances.",
    "Personal airships: Personal airships, also known as blimps, are a type of aircraft that use lighter-than-air gas to lift the aircraft off the ground. With advancements in materials and technology, personal airships could become a viable mode of transportation for short to medium distances, offering a unique and comfortable travel experience.",
    "Water taxis: In coastal cities, water taxis could become a popular mode of transportation if all cars were to suddenly stop working. Water taxis are already used in some cities as a means of transportation, but with advancements in technology, they could become faster, more efficient, and more accessible to the general public.",
    "Pneumatic tubes: Pneumatic tubes are a type of transportation system that use compressed air to move people and objects through a network of tubes. This technology already exists in some forms, such as the London Underground's pneumatic tube system, and could be expanded upon to create a comprehensive transportation network that is both efficient and eco-friendly."
