    "Environmental Impact: The global economy is also dependent on oil for the production of goods and services. If the world ran out of oil, the environmental impact would be severe. The burning of fossil fuels like oil contributes to climate change and air pollution. A sudden halt in oil production would result in a significant reduction in greenhouse gas emissions, leading to a decrease in global temperatures and air quality.",
    "Political Instability: The world would face political instability due to the shortage of oil. Countries that rely heavily on oil for their economy would face economic hardship, leading to social unrest and political instability.",
    "Increased Investment in Renewable Energy: If the world ran out of oil, it would force countries to invest heavily in renewable energy sources like solar, wind, and hydroelectric power. This would lead to a rapid transition to clean energy, reducing the world's dependence on fossil fuels.",
    "Transportation Challenges: The world would face significant transportation challenges if it ran out of oil. The current transportation system is heavily dependent on oil, and a sudden shortage would cause a disruption in the supply chain, leading to delays and increased costs for goods and services.",
    "Increased Investment in Energy Efficiency: A shortage of oil would force countries to invest heavily in energy efficiency measures, leading to a reduction in energy consumption and lower greenhouse gas emissions."
