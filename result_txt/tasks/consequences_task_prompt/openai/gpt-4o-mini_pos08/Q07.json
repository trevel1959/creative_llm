    "**Economic Disruption**: The global economy heavily relies on the Internet for transactions, marketing, and supply chain management. E-commerce would vanish, leading to a dramatic decline in sales for many businesses. Stock markets, which depend on real-time data and online trading, would experience chaos, potentially leading to financial crises. Additionally, many jobs that exist solely because of the Internet—like digital marketing, online customer service, and tech development—would disappear, leading to massive unemployment.",
    "**Information Accessibility Crisis**: The Internet is a primary source of information for billions. Without it, access to knowledge would revert to libraries, textbooks, and traditional media. This would create significant barriers to education, particularly in remote areas where resources are scarce. Research and innovation would slow down dramatically, as scholars and students would struggle to share information quickly, leading to stagnation in various fields, including science and technology.",
    "**Cultural Isolation**: The Internet has allowed for a global exchange of cultures, ideas, and art forms. Its absence would lead to a more localized and insular society where people are less aware of global events, trends, and cultural phenomena. This could result in a decline in cultural diversity and a rise in nationalism as communities become more focused on their immediate surroundings rather than global citizenship.",
    "**Innovation Stagnation**: Many modern innovations rely on the Internet for collaboration and development. Without it, tech companies would face enormous challenges in sharing ideas and advancements. Research and development would slow significantly, impacting sectors like healthcare, renewable energy, and artificial intelligence. The lack of connectivity would stifle creativity and collaboration, resulting in fewer breakthroughs and advancements.",
    "**Social Disconnection**: Social media platforms have transformed how people connect and build relationships. The absence of the Internet would mean a return to more traditional social structures, which could lead to feelings of isolation for many, especially younger generations accustomed to online interactions. This could have psychological effects, leading to increased loneliness and mental health issues as people struggle to adapt to a world without their digital social networks."
