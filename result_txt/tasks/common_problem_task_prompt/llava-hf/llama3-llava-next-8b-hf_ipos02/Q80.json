This could be a challenge for couples who are looking to save money while still having an eco-friendly wedding.",
    "One of the biggest challenges of planning an eco-friendly wedding is the lack of regulation and standards in the industry. This means that it can be difficult to know if a vendor is truly eco-friendly or if they are simply marketing themselves as such. Couples may need to do their own research and due diligence to ensure that their vendors are truly committed to sustainability.",

    "The logistics of planning an eco-friendly wedding can be complex. Couples may need to coordinate with vendors to ensure that everything from the venue to the catering to the decor is eco-friendly. This can require extra time and effort, and may even require couples to be more flexible in their planning."
