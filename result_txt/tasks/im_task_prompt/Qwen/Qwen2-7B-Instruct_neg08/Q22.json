    "**Voice-Activated Flashlight**: Implement voice commands to turn the flashlight on and off, adjust brightness levels, and change modes. Users could say \"Light up\" to activate the flashlight, making it more hands-free and convenient to use in situations where both hands are needed elsewhere.",
    "**Wearable Flashlight**: Create a lightweight, flexible, and durable fabric version of a flashlight that can be worn like a bracelet or a watch. This allows users to have a flashlight always at hand without the need to carry an additional item. It can also be designed to automatically turn on when the user detects movement or darkness.",
    "**Emergency Power Bank Flashlight**: Combine the functionality of a traditional flashlight with an integrated power bank. This allows users to charge their smartphones, tablets, or other devices during power outages or when they're in areas with limited electricity. The power bank would be rechargeable through solar panels or USB connections.",
    "**Augmented Reality Flashlight**: Develop a flashlight that pairs with an AR app on a smartphone. When used together, the flashlight can highlight objects or features in the environment, such as landmarks, plants, or architectural elements, providing a unique and educational experience.",
    "**Waterproof and Durable Outdoor Flashlight**: Design a flashlight specifically for outdoor activities, such as hiking or camping. This flashlight should be highly resistant to water, impact, and extreme temperatures. It could also have a built-in compass, thermometer, and weather sensor to provide essential information in unpredictable environments."
