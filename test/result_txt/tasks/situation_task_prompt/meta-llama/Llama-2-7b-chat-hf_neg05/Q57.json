    "Floating Islands: One creative solution to living in an ocean with rising levels would be to build floating islands. These islands could be constructed using sustainable materials such as recycled plastic, and designed to float on top of the water. They could be equipped with everything needed for daily life, including homes, gardens, and even small businesses.",
    "Submerged Cities: Another option would be to transform existing coastal cities into submerged cities. This could involve building underwater structures that could accommodate homes, offices, and other essential services. The city could be designed to mimic the existing architecture of the coastal city, with the added benefit of being protected from rising sea levels.",
    "Water-Breathing Buildings: For a more futuristic solution, buildings could be designed to breathe water. This would involve creating structures that can extract water from the surrounding ocean and use it for various purposes, such as irrigation and cooling. This would reduce the need for freshwater and help to conserve this precious resource.",
    "Aquatic Agriculture: Another creative solution would be to create aquatic agriculture systems. These could involve floating gardens or underwater greenhouses that use hydroponics or aquaponics to grow crops. This would provide a sustainable source of food, even in the face of rising ocean levels.",
    "Artificial Islands: Finally, an even more ambitious solution would be to create artificial islands using advanced technology. These islands could be built using 3D printing or other innovative techniques, and could be located in strategic positions to provide shelter for people displaced by rising sea levels. The islands could be designed to be self-sustaining, with their own power and water systems, and could become new centers of human habitation."
