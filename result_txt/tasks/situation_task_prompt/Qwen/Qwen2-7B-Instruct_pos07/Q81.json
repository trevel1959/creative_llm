    "**Biometric Verification**: Each person could be uniquely identified through their biometric features like fingerprints, iris patterns, facial recognition, or even unique voice characteristics. This system would store these data securely and match them against a database when someone needs to prove their identity.",
    "**Behavioral Biometrics**: This involves analyzing behavioral patterns such as typing speed, mouse movements, and other digital habits to identify individuals. This method can be particularly useful for online authentication processes where people might not have any physical identification available.",
    "**Genetic Identification**: In the future, genetic information might become a reliable way to prove oneâ€™s identity. By using specific DNA markers unique to each individual, a secure database could be created to verify identities.",
    "**Personalized Clothing/Accessories**: People could wear items like hats, shoes, or necklaces that contain microchips or QR codes linked to their personal information. When needed, they scan or input this code into a system to verify their identity.",
    "**Social Network Validation**: A new decentralized social network could be built on blockchain technology where users validate each other's identities based on mutual connections and verified personal details. This network could then provide proof of identity through the consensus of the community."
