    "Key-less Entry System: Develop a smartphone-based keyless entry system that utilizes near-field communication (NFC) or Bluetooth technology. Users can download an app that connects to their home's Wi-Fi network, allowing them to unlock their doors with their smartphones. This system would eliminate the need for physical keys while still providing secure access to the home.",
    "Fingerprint Scanning Locks: Install fingerprint scanning locks on all doors and drawers. These locks would use advanced biometric technology to recognize and unlock using the unique patterns found in each individual's fingerprints. This would eliminate the need for keys altogether and provide an added layer of security.",
    "Smart Locks with facial recognition: Invest in smart locks that utilize facial recognition technology to identify and unlock the homeowner or authorized users. These locks would use cameras to capture and recognize the homeowner's or user's face, providing secure and convenient access to the home.",
    "Personalized Key Fobs: Develop a keyless entry system that utilizes personalized key fobs. Each fob would contain a unique code that would need to be entered into the home's security system to gain access. These fobs could be made of a durable material such as metal or plastic and could be designed with different colors or designs to add a decorative element to the home's security system.",
    "Smart Home Network: Create a smart home network that integrates all of the home's locks, lights, and appliances into one centralized system. This system would allow users to control and monitor their home's security remotely using a smartphone app. For example, users could lock and unlock doors, turn on lights, and adjust thermostat settings all from their phone. This would eliminate the need for physical keys and provide a more streamlined and convenient security system."
