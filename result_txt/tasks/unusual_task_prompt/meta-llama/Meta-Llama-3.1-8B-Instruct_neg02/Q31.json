    "**Eco-Genetic Restoration**: Develop a technology that can genetically engineer plants to absorb and convert pollutants into harmless substances. This innovation could be used to restore damaged ecosystems, clean polluted soil, and even produce biofuels. The genetically engineered plants would be designed to thrive in areas with high levels of pollutants, and their unique properties would allow them to break down toxic substances into non-toxic ones. This technology could revolutionize the way we approach environmental remediation and sustainability.",
    "**Smart Contact Lenses**: Design a new generation of contact lenses that can monitor vital signs, provide augmented reality displays, and even offer personalized health advice. These smart lenses would be equipped with tiny sensors and microchips that can track the wearer's glucose levels, heart rate, and other health metrics. They could also display virtual information, such as navigation directions or reminders, in a seamless and intuitive way. This technology could transform the way we interact with our surroundings and monitor our health.",
    "**Space-Based Solar Power**: Develop a system that harnesses solar energy in orbit around the Earth and beams it back to the planet as a clean and constant source of power. This technology would involve deploying a network of solar panels in space, where they can collect energy without being affected by weather or seasonal changes. The energy would then be transmitted back to Earth as microwaves or lasers, providing a reliable and sustainable source of power. This innovation could help mitigate climate change by reducing our reliance on fossil fuels and providing a clean alternative energy source.",
    "**Personalized Cancer Treatment**: Create a system that uses AI and machine learning to analyze individual cancer cases and develop personalized treatment plans. This technology would involve analyzing genetic data, medical histories, and other factors to identify the most effective treatment options for each patient. The AI system would then provide doctors with tailored recommendations for chemotherapy, radiation therapy, or other treatments, increasing the chances of successful treatment and reducing side effects. This innovation could revolutionize the way we approach cancer treatment and improve patient outcomes.",
    "**Underwater Cities**: Design and build self-sustaining underwater cities that can support human life and commerce without harming the surrounding ecosystem. These cities would be equipped with advanced life support systems, renewable energy sources, and innovative waste management technologies. They could also serve as hubs for marine research, education, and conservation, promoting a deeper understanding of the ocean and its importance to our planet. This technology could help address the challenges of overpopulation, climate change, and resource depletion by providing a sustainable"
