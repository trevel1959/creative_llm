    "**Eco-Friendly and Biodegradable Materials**: Develop a yoga mat made from entirely biodegradable materials, such as natural rubber or organic cotton. This mat would decompose after its lifecycle, reducing plastic waste. Additionally, it could be infused with plant-based dyes and scents to enhance the sensory experience during practice.",
    "**Adjustable Thickness and Firmness**: Create a yoga mat with adjustable thickness and firmness, allowing users to customize their mat based on the type of practice they are doing. For instance, it could feature removable layers or air-filled compartments that can be inflated or deflated to provide more cushioning for restorative practices or a firmer base for balance poses.",
    "**Integrated Aromatherapy Diffuser**: Design a yoga mat with built-in compartments that can hold essential oils or aromatherapy beads.

This feature could help create a more immersive experience, especially during meditation or restorative sessions.",
    "**Interactive Yoga Mat with LED Guidance**: Develop a yoga mat with embedded LED lights that can guide users through poses. The lights could illuminate the correct positions for various asanas, helping beginners learn the correct form.

    "**Portable and Foldable Design**: Innovate a yoga mat that can easily fold into a compact size for portability. This mat could have a built-in carrying case with pockets for essentials like water bottles, towels, and yoga props.
