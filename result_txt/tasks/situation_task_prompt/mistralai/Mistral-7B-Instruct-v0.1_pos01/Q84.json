    "I would use a walker to move around. Walkers are similar to wheelchairs, but they are designed for people who have some mobility. They have two legs that can be used to push the walker forward, and they are often used by people who have difficulty walking on their own.",

    "I would use crutches to move around. Crutches are a common solution for people who have difficulty walking or standing. They can be used to support the body and provide stability while walking or standing.",
