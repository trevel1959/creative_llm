    "Emergency evacuation procedures: Skyscrapers typically have emergency evacuation procedures in place. Building management or security personnel would guide occupants to the nearest stairwell and assist them in ascending to the top floor.",
    "Utilize other means of transportation: In the absence of functioning elevators, occupants could use alternative means of transportation, such as taking the stairs to the nearest floor and then using another elevator to reach the top.",
    "Implement a temporary elevator system: If the issue is localized to a specific elevator, building management could consider installing a temporary elevator system to facilitate the movement of people to the top floor.",
    "Utilize emergency evacuation chairs: In some cases, emergency evacuation chairs might be available to assist individuals who are unable to climb the stairs, such as those with physical disabilities.",
    "Use external ladders: In the event of a complete elevator failure, building management could consider installing external ladders on the exterior of the building to allow occupants to climb to the top."
