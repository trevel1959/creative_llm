    "Homelessness Housing Hub: Create a centralized hub for homeless individuals to access various services and resources, including temporary housing, job training, and mental health support. The hub could be located in a vacant or underutilized building, and would provide a one-stop-shop for those in need.",
    "Mobile Outreach Center: Develop a mobile outreach center that can travel to different areas of the city where homelessness is prevalent. The center could provide on-site services such as medical check-ups, showers, and clothing distributions, as well as connect individuals with local resources and support.",
    "Community Land Trust: Establish a community land trust that allows homeless individuals to purchase or rent homes at a discounted rate, with the option to buy or sell the home in the future. This would provide a sense of security and stability for those who are struggling to find affordable housing.",
    "Micro-Units: Develop micro-units, which are small, efficient apartments that are affordable and can be rented or purchased. These units could be located in urban areas and would provide a more permanent housing option for those who are currently living on the streets or in shelters.",
    "Virtual Reality Simulation: Create a virtual reality simulation that allows potential homebuyers to experience what it's like to live in different types of affordable housing units. This would help individuals make more informed decisions about their housing options and could help to reduce homelessness by providing a more realistic view of what is available."
