    "\"Waste-to-Energy\": Develop a waste-to-energy facility that converts waste into electricity and heat. The facility would use advanced technology to break down waste into its component parts, extracting valuable energy from the process. This would not only help to manage waste, but also provide a sustainable source of energy for homes and businesses.",
    "\"Waste-to-Resources\": Create a waste-to-resources program that utilizes waste materials to create new products. For example, old newspapers could be turned into new paper, and glass bottles could be melted down to create new glass products. This approach would not only help to manage waste, but also reduce the demand for new raw materials and promote sustainability.",
    "\"Waste-to-Art\": Develop a waste-to-art initiative that encourages artists to create works of art from discarded materials. This could include sculptures made from old metal, paintings created with recycled paper, or installations constructed from repurposed plastic. This approach would not only help to manage waste, but also promote creativity and inspire new forms of art.",
    "\"Waste-to-Food\": Create a waste-to-food program that utilizes food waste to produce compost. This compost could then be used as a natural fertilizer for gardens and farms, reducing the need for synthetic fertilizers and promoting sustainable agriculture.",
    "\"Waste-to-Fuel\": Develop a waste-to-fuel facility that converts waste materials into biofuels. This would not only help to manage waste, but also provide a sustainable source of fuel for vehicles and other applications."
