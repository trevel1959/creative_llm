    "Floating Olympic Stadium: Create a stadium that floats on water, allowing athletes to compete in aquatic events while the audience watches from a safe distance. The stadium could be designed with a unique wave-inspired architecture, complete with undulating seating and a translucent dome that changes colors during events.",
    "Virtual Reality Olympic Experience: Develop a virtual reality experience that allows spectators to compete in Olympic events from the comfort of their own homes. Participants could don VR headsets and gloves, which would track their movements and allow them to compete in events such as the 100-meter dash, high jump, and even curling.",
    "Carbon Neutral Olympics: Host the Olympics in a carbon-neutral manner by using eco-friendly materials, renewable energy sources, and sustainable transportation. This could include using recycled materials for construction, installing solar panels and wind turbines to generate energy, and creating a network of electric buses and bicycle paths for athletes and spectators.",
    "Interactive Art Installations: Incorporate interactive art installations throughout the Olympic Park, allowing visitors to engage with the art and become a part of the Olympic experience. These installations could include interactive light sculptures, sound-activated displays, and immersive video projections that respond to the athlete's movements and emotions.",
    "Mobile Olympic Village: Create a mobile Olympic village that travels from city to city, bringing the Olympics to different communities around the world. The village could be composed of modular structures that are easy to assemble and disassemble, allowing the village to be reconfigured for each new location. This would not only reduce the environmental impact of the Olympics but also make the event more accessible to a wider audience."
