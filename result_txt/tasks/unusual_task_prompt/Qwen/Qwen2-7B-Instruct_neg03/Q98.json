    "**DIY Smart Power Strip**: Create a smart power strip that integrates with home automation systems like Amazon Alexa or Google Home. This idea involves using microcontrollers (like Arduino or Raspberry Pi) to control power outlets based on user commands or time schedules. The smart power strip can also monitor energy usage, providing insights for energy savings.",
    "**Safety-Focused Surge Protector**: Develop a surge protector with additional safety features such as a heat sensor that shuts off the strip if it overheats, and a motion sensor that turns off unused outlets when no devices are plugged in. This could help prevent fires and save energy.",
    "**USB Hub with Built-in Charging Station**: Combine the functionality of a USB hub with a power strip by adding wireless charging capabilities for compatible devices. This idea would be particularly useful for those with multiple electronic devices and could include a smartphone app to manage charging settings.",
    "**Portable Power Strip with Solar Panel**: Design a portable power strip with an integrated solar panel, making it ideal for outdoor events or camping trips. This concept combines renewable energy sources with the convenience of having multiple electrical outlets, potentially eliminating the need for extension cords or wall sockets.",
    "**Smartphone Docking Station Power Strip**: Integrate a smartphone docking station into a power strip, offering not only charging but also additional functionality like displaying weather information, news updates, or controlling smart home devices through voice commands. This idea would appeal to tech-savvy users looking to streamline their daily gadget management."
