    "Regeneration of limbs could potentially revolutionize the field of prosthetics, making it possible to create limbs that are more functional and adaptable to individual needs. This could greatly improve the quality of life for people who have lost limbs or have limited mobility.",
    "The ability to regenerate limbs could also have implications for animal welfare. For example, it could be possible to regenerate the limbs of animals that have been injured in the wild or in captivity, potentially reducing the need for euthanasia in these cases.",
    "If humans were able to regenerate limbs like starfish, it could potentially lead to advancements in our understanding of regeneration and regenerative medicine. This could have implications for the treatment of other conditions, such as spinal cord injuries or heart disease.",
    "The ability to regenerate limbs could also have implications for space exploration. If astronauts were able to regenerate lost limbs while in space, it could potentially make long-duration missions more feasible and safer.",
    "The ability to regenerate limbs could also have implications for the environment. For example, it could be possible to use regenerative materials to repair damaged ecosystems or to create more sustainable infrastructure."
