    "**Adjustable Bristle Stiffness**: Design a paintbrush with a mechanism that allows users to adjust the stiffness of the bristles. By turning a dial on the handle, artists can switch between soft, flexible bristles for washes and stiffer bristles for detailed work. This adaptability would eliminate the need for multiple brushes and streamline the painting process.",
    "**Built-in Paint Reservoir**: Create a paintbrush that has a small reservoir in the handle to hold a small amount of paint. This reservoir would feed paint directly to the bristles as needed, allowing artists to paint continuously without frequent dips into paint containers. The reservoir could be refillable and transparent, so users can easily see how much paint is left.",
    "**Ergonomic Handle with Grip Customization**: Develop a paintbrush with an ergonomic handle that can be customized in shape and grip texture. Users could mold the handle to fit their hand comfortably, reducing fatigue during long painting sessions. Additionally, the handle could feature interchangeable grips (e.g., rubber, foam, wood) to suit different painting styles and preferences.",
    "**Self-Cleaning Bristles**: Innovate a paintbrush with self-cleaning technology that uses ultrasonic vibrations to dislodge paint from the bristles. By simply placing the brush in a cleaning station and activating it, artists can quickly clean their brushes without damaging the bristles or wasting time scrubbing them manually.",
    "**Light-Up Brush for Night Painting**: Introduce a paintbrush that features LED lights built into the handle or bristles, providing illumination for artists who prefer to paint in low-light conditions. The lights could change color based on the paint being used, offering a fun and functional way to work in different lighting scenarios, such as outdoor night painting sessions."
