    "**Scented Home Decor**: Design a line of home decor items that naturally emit pleasant scents. For example, create wall hangings made from porous clay infused with essential oils that release fragrances when warmed by sunlight or heated by the room's temperature. These items could come in various designs and colors, allowing for both aesthetic appeal and a continuous, subtle scent throughout the home.",
    "**Culinary Aroma Kits**: Develop kits that combine cooking and scent creation. Each kit would include various herbs and spices known for their aromatic properties, such as cinnamon, rosemary, or citrus peels. Users would learn how to create scent-infused oils, vinegars, or even potpourri that could be used in cooking or as natural air fresheners. This would not only provide pleasant scents but also encourage culinary exploration and the use of fresh ingredients.",
    "**Scented Garden Installations**: Collaborate with local communities to create public gardens specifically designed for scent. These gardens would feature a variety of aromatic plants like lavender, jasmine, and mint. Guided tours could be offered to educate visitors about the plants and their uses, while encouraging people to engage with nature. Special events could include scent-based activities, such as creating sachets or essential oil blends from the plants in the garden.",
    "**Personal Scent Capsules**: Invent a series of small, portable scent capsules that contain dried flowers, herbs, and spices. These capsules could be made from biodegradable materials and designed to release fragrance when crushed or shaken. Users could carry them in their bags or pockets and release pleasant scents whenever desired, allowing for a customizable aromatic experience throughout the day.",
    "**Sound and Scent Experiences**: Develop multisensory experiences that combine sound and scent. Create a series of events where live music or soundscapes are paired with the release of specific scents, enhancing the emotional and sensory connection. For instance, a calming classical music session could be accompanied by the scent of fresh lavender or chamomile, creating a holistic relaxation experience that appeals to both the auditory and olfactory senses."
