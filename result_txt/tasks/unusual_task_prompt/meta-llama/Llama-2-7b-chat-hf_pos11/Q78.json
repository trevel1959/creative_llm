    "Wine Glass with a Twist: Create a wine glass with a unique twist on the traditional design. Instead of a standard circular shape, design a glass with a spiral or helix shape that gradually narrows towards the top. This will create a fun and eye-catching design that stands out from the usual wine glasses.",
    "Wine Glass with a Built-in Aerator: Design a wine glass with a built-in aerator that allows the wine to breathe and oxidize as it is being poured. This will help to bring out the full flavors of the wine and create a more enjoyable drinking experience.",
    "Wine Glass with a Temperature Control System: Create a wine glass with a built-in temperature control system that allows the drinker to adjust the temperature of the wine to their liking. This could be achieved through the use of a small heating or cooling element within the glass, or through the use of a special type of glass that is able to maintain a consistent temperature.",
    "Wine Glass with a Hidden Storage Compartment: Design a wine glass with a hidden storage compartment that can be used to store a small amount of wine or other beverage.
