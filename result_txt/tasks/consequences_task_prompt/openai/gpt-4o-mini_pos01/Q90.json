    "**Collapse of Financial Institutions**: The immediate aftermath of erasing all debt could destabilize financial institutions that rely on debt as a primary source of income. Banks, insurance companies, and investment firms could face massive losses, leading to a potential collapse of the financial system. The trust in these institutions might erode, causing a crisis of confidence and a rush to withdraw funds, further exacerbating the situation.",
    "**Wealth Redistribution**: With debt erased, wealth could be redistributed more evenly across the population. Individuals who were previously burdened by debt would find themselves in a stronger financial position, while wealthy individuals and corporations that profited from interest payments might see a decrease in their relative wealth. This shift could lead to social unrest or political movements advocating for new economic models that prioritize equity.",
    "**Inflation and Currency Devaluation**: The sudden release of capital into the economy could lead to rampant inflation, as demand outstrips supply. Governments might struggle to control inflationary pressures, leading to currency devaluation. Citizens could find that while they are debt-free, their purchasing power diminishes rapidly, leading to a new set of economic challenges.",
    "**Changes in Global Trade Dynamics**: Countries that were heavily indebted may find themselves in a more favorable position without debt obligations, potentially shifting the balance of power in global trade. This could lead to new alliances and trade agreements as nations seek to capitalize on their newfound financial freedom. However, countries that relied on the interest from loans may face economic challenges, leading to geopolitical tensions.",
    "**Crisis of Responsibility and Accountability**: Erasing all debt could lead to a crisis of personal and corporate responsibility. If individuals and businesses know that debts can be erased, there may be less incentive to manage finances prudently. This could lead to a culture of recklessness, where people take on excessive risks, knowing that there are no consequences for failure, ultimately leading to future financial crises."
