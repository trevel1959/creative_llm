    "**Built-in Bluetooth Speaker**: Transform the picnic basket into a portable entertainment hub by incorporating a high-quality Bluetooth speaker. This speaker can connect to smartphones or tablets, allowing users to enjoy their favorite music or podcasts while dining outdoors. Additionally, the speaker could feature a waterproof design and a long-lasting battery, ensuring that it withstands outdoor conditions.",
    "**Modular Compartment Design**: Design the picnic basket with modular compartments that can be rearranged or removed based on the user's needs. For instance, users could customize the size of the food storage area, add extra compartments for utensils, or create a separate section for drinks. This flexibility would make it easier to pack for different types of outings, whether itâ€™s a romantic picnic or a family gathering.",
    "**Eco-Friendly Materials**: Create the picnic basket using sustainable and biodegradable materials, such as bamboo or recycled plastics. This would not only appeal to environmentally conscious consumers but also reduce the overall carbon footprint of the product. Additionally, offering a repair service or parts replacement program would encourage users to keep their baskets longer rather than discarding them.",
    "**Integrated LED Lighting**: Equip the picnic basket with built-in LED lights that can illuminate the inside and outside of the basket. This feature would be especially useful for evening picnics or camping trips, allowing users to easily find items in low light. The lights could be solar-powered or rechargeable, and users could adjust the brightness or set a timer for automatic shut-off.",
    "**Multi-Functional Design**: Reinvent the picnic basket to serve multiple purposes, such as a portable grill or cooking station. By incorporating foldable grill components, the basket could transform into a cooking area, allowing users to prepare hot meals on-site. Additionally, the basket could include detachable utensils and plates that can be stored within the design, making it a one-stop solution for outdoor dining."
