    "**Create an Emergency Fire Bucket**: Gather large containers such as trash cans or buckets filled with water. Position them strategically around your house, near potential sources of fire like woodpiles, dry grass, or near electrical appliances. In case of a fire, these buckets can be used to douse flames immediately.",
    "**Develop a Fire Escape Plan**: This includes identifying multiple escape routes from each room in your house. Make sure everyone in the household knows where to go and what to do in case of a fire. Include a designated meeting point outside the house for all members to gather once they've safely evacuated.",
    "**Build a Fireproof Room**: Design a room with fire-resistant materials that could serve as a temporary refuge during a fire. Use non-flammable insulation, steel or concrete walls, and a fireproof door. Stock this room with essentials like water, food, first aid kits, and blankets.",
    "**Install Smoke Detectors**: Even without traditional firefighting equipment, having smoke detectors can provide early warning of a fire. Install them on every floor of your house, especially near bedrooms, and ensure they are tested regularly. ",
    "**Use Water and Soil as a Natural Fire Retardant**: If you have access to soil and water, create a \"fire barrier\" around your house. Dampen soil around the perimeter of your property and use it to surround your house. This can help slow down the spread of fire and give you more time to evacuate or extinguish the fire manually."
