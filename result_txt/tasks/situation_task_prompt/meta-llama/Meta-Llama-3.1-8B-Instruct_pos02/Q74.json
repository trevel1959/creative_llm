    "**Edible Skincare**: In a world without commercial cosmetic products, I would focus on utilizing food as a primary means of skincare. I'd use natural ingredients like turmeric, honey, and avocado to create face masks, scrubs, and moisturizers. For example, I'd mash ripe avocados and mix them with honey to create a soothing face mask. I'd also use turmeric as a natural exfoliant and anti-inflammatory agent. This approach would not only provide me with a sustainable and environmentally friendly skincare routine but also ensure that I'm nourishing my skin with wholesome ingredients.",
    "**Natural Dyeing**: Without commercial hair dyes, I'd explore natural alternatives to color my hair. I'd use ingredients like beets, coffee, and turmeric to create a range of vibrant shades. For instance, I'd boil beets in water to create a deep pink dye, while coffee could be used to achieve a rich brown color. This approach would not only be eco-friendly but also allow me to experiment with unique and dynamic hair colors.",
    "**Soap Making**: In a world without commercial soap, I'd learn the art of soap making using natural ingredients like coconut oil, olive oil, and essential oils. I'd create custom soap recipes to cater to my skin type and preferences, ensuring a gentle and nourishing cleansing experience. This approach would not only provide me with a sustainable and effective soap solution but also allow me to control the ingredients and scents used in my soap.",
    "**Bee Products**: I'd rely on bee products like beeswax, honey, and propolis to maintain my personal grooming habits. Beeswax would be used as a natural lip balm and skin moisturizer, while honey would be used as a face mask and hair treatment. Propolis, with its antibacterial properties, would be used to create a natural deodorant and skin toner. This approach would not only be eco-friendly but also provide me with a range of natural and effective grooming products.",
    "**Clay and Mineral Masks**: Without commercial face masks, I'd focus on using natural clays and minerals to detoxify and nourish my skin. I'd use ingredients like kaolin clay, rhassoul clay, and dead sea salt to create custom face masks tailored to my skin type and concerns. This approach would not only provide me with a sustainable and effective skincare routine but also allow me to experiment with unique and rejuvenating face masks. [/INST] "
