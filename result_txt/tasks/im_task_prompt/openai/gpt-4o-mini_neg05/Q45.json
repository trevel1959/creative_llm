    "**Integrated Lighting with Mood Settings**: Design a ceiling fan that features built-in LED lights that can change colors and brightness levels based on the time of day or user preference. This fan could be controlled via a smartphone app, allowing users to set different moods for different timesâ€”bright white light for working, warm yellow for relaxing, and colorful options for parties. Additionally, the lights could sync with music for a dynamic atmosphere.",
    "**Eco-Friendly Materials and Energy Generation**: Create a ceiling fan made from sustainable materials, such as bamboo or recycled plastics, that also incorporates small solar panels on its blades. These solar panels could generate energy to power the fan itself, reducing electricity consumption. This design would appeal to environmentally conscious consumers and could also come with a battery backup for nighttime use.",
    "**Self-Cleaning Technology**: Innovate a ceiling fan that features a self-cleaning mechanism. This could involve a special coating on the blades that repels dust and dirt, or a built-in fan cleaning system that uses small jets of air to blow away debris. This would significantly reduce the maintenance required for ceiling fans, making them more appealing to busy homeowners.",
    "**Modular Design for Customization**: Develop a modular ceiling fan that allows users to customize the appearance and functionality of their fan. Users could choose different blade designs, colors, and materials to match their home decor. Additionally, modules could be added or removed for features like integrated speakers, aromatherapy diffusers, or even a small humidifier, allowing for a personalized experience.",
    "**Voice-Controlled Fan with AI Integration**: Create a ceiling fan that integrates with voice-activated home assistants like Alexa or Google Assistant. Users could control the fan's speed, direction, and lighting through voice commands. Furthermore, the fan could learn user preferences over time, adjusting its settings automatically based on when people are home or their typical routines."
