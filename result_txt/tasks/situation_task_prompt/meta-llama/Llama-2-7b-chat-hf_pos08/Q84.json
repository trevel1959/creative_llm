    "Wheelchair Innovation: Create a smart, AI-powered wheelchair that can navigate through spaces with ease, avoiding obstacles and adapting to different environments. The wheelchair could have a built-in computer vision system that can recognize and respond to its surroundings, allowing the user to control it with their eyes or voice commands. This innovation would enable individuals with mobility impairments to move around with greater independence and freedom.",
    "Exoskeleton Suit: Design an advanced exoskeleton suit that can be worn like a second skin, providing support and mobility for individuals with paralysis or muscle weakness. The suit would use advanced sensors and actuators to detect and respond to the user's movements, allowing them to walk, stand, and move around with greater ease. This technology could potentially enable individuals with severe mobility impairments to walk and move around without the need for a wheelchair.",
    "Virtual Reality Mobility Training: Develop a virtual reality mobility training program that enables individuals with mobility impairments to practice and improve their movement skills in a simulated environment. The program could include a variety of exercises and activities, such as walking through a virtual park or navigating a virtual city, and could be tailored to the individual's specific needs and abilities. This training could help individuals build confidence and improve their mobility in real-life situations.",
    "Smart Cane: Create a smart cane that can detect and respond to the user's movements, providing real-time feedback and support. The cane could have a built-in computer vision system that can detect obstacles and provide audio or tactile feedback to help the user avoid them. The cane could also have a built-in motor that can provide additional support and stability, allowing the user to walk more easily and confidently. This innovation could help individuals with mobility impairments to walk more safely and independently.",
    "Advanced Prosthetics: Develop advanced prosthetic limbs that can be controlled using the user's thoughts or muscle signals. The prosthetics could be customized to the individual's specific needs and abilities, allowing them to perform a wide range of tasks, such as grasping and manipulating objects, walking, and running. This technology could potentially enable individuals with amputations or other mobility impair"
