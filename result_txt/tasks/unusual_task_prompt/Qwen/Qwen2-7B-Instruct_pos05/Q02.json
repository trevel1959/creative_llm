    "**Interactive Sensory Training Tool**: Create a rubber hand that is used in sensory training for individuals who have lost limb function due to amputation or injury. The rubber hand can be programmed to vibrate or change color in response to signals sent from the remaining limb. This helps in enhancing the sense of touch and proprioception, aiding in rehabilitation.",
    "**Educational Toy for Children**: Develop a set of rubber hands, each with different textures, colors, and sizes, aimed at teaching young children about the diversity of human anatomy and the importance of hand dexterity and fine motor skills. This toy could also incorporate educational elements like simple math problems or language learning through tactile feedback.",
    "**Virtual Reality Integration**: Combine a rubber hand with virtual reality technology to create an immersive experience where users can interact with virtual objects using their rubber hand. This can be used for gaming, training simulations (like surgery or piloting), or even as a tool for mental health therapy by providing controlled, simulated tactile experiences.",
    "**Gaming Controller Alternative**: Design a rubber hand that can be used as a more intuitive and personalized gaming controller. By mapping the movements of the rubber hand to specific game actions, it offers a unique and potentially more responsive control mechanism compared to traditional controllers. This could be especially beneficial for gamers with physical disabilities.",
    "**Augmented Reality Art Installation**: Create an augmented reality art installation where viewers wear a pair of smart glasses and see a digital overlay of a rubber hand on top of the real world. As they move their real hand, the digital rubber hand responds in a synchronized manner, creating an interactive and engaging experience that blends the physical and digital worlds. This could be used in museums, galleries, or public spaces to enhance the viewing experience and educate the public about technology and art integration."
