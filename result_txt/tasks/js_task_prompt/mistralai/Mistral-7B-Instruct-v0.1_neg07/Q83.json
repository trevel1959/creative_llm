    "24-hour day: I would choose a 24-hour day because it is already the standard length of a day and it allows for a full cycle of light and darkness, which is essential for the functioning of living organisms.",
    "30-hour day: I would choose a 30-hour day because it would allow for more productivity and efficiency in a day. People could get more done in a shorter amount of time, which would lead to a better work-life balance.",
    "28-hour day: I would choose a 28-hour day because it would be slightly shorter than a standard day, but still long enough to get most things done. It would also allow for more time for leisure and relaxation.",
    "36-hour day: I would choose a 36-hour day because it would allow for more time to accomplish tasks and to also have some time to relax and recharge. It would also be interesting to see how people would adjust to a longer day.",
    "22-hour day: I would choose a 22-hour day because it would be a good balance between a standard day and a shorter day. It would allow for productivity and efficiency while also allowing for some time to relax and recharge."
