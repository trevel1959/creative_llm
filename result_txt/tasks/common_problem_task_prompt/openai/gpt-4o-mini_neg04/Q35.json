    "**Visitor Safety**: With large crowds, the safety of visitors can become a concern. Issues may arise from animal escapes, aggressive animal behavior, or unsafe infrastructure. To address this, the zoo could invest in enhanced barriers, regular safety drills, and staff training programs focused on emergency response protocols to ensure that both visitors and animals remain safe.",
    "**Funding and Financial Sustainability**: Zoos often rely on ticket sales, donations, and sponsorships for funding. Economic downturns or negative public perception can lead to decreased revenue. To combat this, the zoo could diversify its income sources by offering educational programs, hosting events, or developing partnerships with local businesses to create sponsorship opportunities that enhance the zoo's financial stability.",
    "**Conservation and Breeding Programs**: Many zoos participate in conservation efforts and breeding programs for endangered species. Challenges may include limited genetic diversity, difficulty in breeding certain species, or lack of public interest in conservation. The zoo could tackle these issues by collaborating with global conservation organizations, utilizing genetic research to inform breeding choices, and launching awareness campaigns to engage the public in conservation efforts.",
    "**Staff Management and Training**: A zoo requires a diverse team, including animal caretakers, educators, and administrative staff. High turnover rates or insufficient training can lead to poor animal care and visitor experiences. The zoo could implement a robust training program that emphasizes career development, job satisfaction, and team-building activities to retain skilled staff and ensure they are well-equipped to handle their responsibilities.",
    "**Environmental Impact and Sustainability**: Operating a zoo can have environmental consequences, such as waste management issues, energy consumption, and habitat destruction. To mitigate this, the zoo could adopt sustainable practices, such as utilizing renewable energy sources, implementing a recycling program, and creating habitats that mimic natural environments to minimize the ecological footprint."
