    "**Detecting Structural Issues:** If I could see through walls, I'd use this ability to inspect buildings for structural issues that are not visible from the surface. This would be particularly useful in assessing the integrity of old or potentially hazardous structures. For example, I could check for cracks, water damage, or signs of termites without needing to tear down walls or floors.",
    "**Environmental Monitoring:** Imagine being able to monitor air quality, temperature, and humidity levels inside buildings without entering them. This would allow for remote and continuous monitoring of environments that might be difficult or dangerous to access directly, such as industrial facilities, underground tunnels, or high-altitude structures.",
    "**Crime Prevention:** If I could see through walls, I'd utilize this power to deter crime by keeping an eye on activities in private or restricted areas. By secretly observing potential illegal activities, I could alert authorities and prevent crimes before they occur. This could be especially effective in surveillance-sensitive situations where traditional methods are compromised or inadequate.",
    "**Historical Preservation:** I'd use my ability to see through walls to uncover hidden artifacts or historical structures beneath modern developments. This would help archaeologists and historians better understand past civilizations and provide crucial information about cultural heritage sites that might otherwise be lost or destroyed during construction projects.",
    "**Emergency Response:** In emergency situations, being able to see through walls would greatly enhance rescue efforts. For instance, during a building collapse, I could locate survivors trapped inside or identify the extent of damage within collapsed structures. Similarly, in natural disasters like earthquakes or floods, I could assess the safety of buildings and infrastructure from afar, guiding rescue teams to the most critical areas."
