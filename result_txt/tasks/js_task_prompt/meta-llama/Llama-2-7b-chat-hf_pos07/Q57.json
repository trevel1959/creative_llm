    "Participatory Democracy: This system combines elements of direct democracy and representative democracy, allowing citizens to actively participate in decision-making while still having representatives to handle day-to-day governance. Citizens would have the power to vote on key policies and laws, while representatives would be elected to represent their interests and ensure the government runs smoothly.",
    "Meritocracy: In this system, citizens would vote for their representatives based on their merits rather than their political affiliations. The most qualified and capable individuals would hold positions of power, ensuring that the government is run by the most competent and knowledgeable individuals.",
    "Conflict Resolution Government: This system would focus on resolving conflicts and disputes through mediation and negotiation rather than through the use of force. The government would be made up of trained mediators and negotiators who would work to find mutually beneficial solutions to conflicts, rather than trying to impose a single solution.",
    "Holistic Government: This system would prioritize the well-being of the entire community, rather than just a select few. It would consider the interconnectedness of all aspects of society, including economic, social, and environmental factors, when making decisions. This would result in a more sustainable and equitable society.",
    "Collaborative Governance: In this system, government would be decentralized and power would be distributed among various stakeholders, including citizens, community organizations, and local governments. This would create a more participatory and inclusive form of government, where all voices are heard and valued."
