    "**Impact on Retirement Systems**: With an extended lifespan, traditional retirement systems might become unsustainable. Governments and employers would need to adjust pension schemes to account for people living longer. There could be discussions about raising the retirement age or introducing phased retirement options, allowing individuals to gradually transition out of full-time work while still contributing to society.",
    "**Economic Shifts**: An aging population could lead to a shift in consumer spending patterns. Healthcare and elderly care services would likely see increased demand, driving growth in those sectors. Conversely, there might be a decrease in demand for products typically aimed at younger demographics, such as toys and fashion items marketed towards teenagers and young adults.",
    "**Psychological Impact**: Living longer could have profound psychological effects. For many, the fear of death is a motivating factor that drives productivity and goal-setting. Without this fear, people might struggle to find purpose and meaning in their lives, leading to existential crises. On the other hand, extended life could allow for more time to pursue personal interests and hobbies, potentially enhancing overall well-being.",
    "**Demographic Changes**: The global balance of power might shift due to changes in population demographics. Countries with large populations of aging citizens could face challenges in maintaining economic competitiveness and supporting their populations. Meanwhile, countries with younger populations might benefit from a larger, more dynamic workforce.",
    "**Social Structures and Relationships**: Longer lifespans could challenge existing social structures, particularly those centered around family dynamics. Extended periods of cohabitation among family members could lead to new forms of social support networks. At the same time, it might strain relationships between generations, as grandparents, parents, and children would spend more time together over longer periods."
