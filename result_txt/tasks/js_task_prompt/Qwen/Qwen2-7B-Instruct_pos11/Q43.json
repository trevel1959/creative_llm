    "**Crime Prevention and Surveillance**: Utilize your ability to see through walls as a form of proactive crime prevention. By monitoring potential crime scenes or high-risk areas unseen by the public, you can provide early warnings or evidence to law enforcement agencies. This could involve detecting illegal activities like drug trafficking, illegal dumping, or suspicious gatherings in private spaces.",
    "**Building Inspection and Maintenance**: As a property owner or manager, being able to see through walls would greatly aid in identifying structural issues, plumbing leaks, or electrical faults without the need for invasive inspections. This would not only save on costs but also ensure safety and prevent potential disasters.",
    "**Environmental Monitoring**: Employ your power to monitor environmental conditions in buildings, such as air quality or radiation levels, which are often invisible to the naked eye. This could be particularly useful in areas with high pollution or nuclear facilities, helping to protect both human health and the environment.",
    "**Historical Research**: Use your ability to explore historical sites or ancient structures that are currently inaccessible due to physical barriers. This could include gaining insights into the layout of buildings from centuries ago, discovering hidden artifacts, or understanding past construction techniques. This could contribute significantly to historical research and education.",
    "**Urban Planning and Design**: Assist urban planners and architects by providing them with unseen perspectives on city layouts, building footprints, or underground infrastructure. This could lead to more efficient designs, better resource allocation, and innovative solutions for city planning challenges, such as optimizing public transportation routes or creating green spaces in densely populated areas."
