    "**Create a Time Management Journal**: Start by creating a journal that tracks your daily activities, tasks, and how you spend your time. Include sections for setting goals, planning tasks, tracking progress, and reflecting on daily accomplishments. Use this tool to identify patterns in procrastination and allocate specific times for assignments. This method helps in building a habit of time management and reduces the stress associated with last-minute work.",
    "**Implement a 'Do Not Disturb' Policy**: Establish designated times during the day where you are not available for any interruptions or distractions (e.g., no phone calls, emails, social media). Inform colleagues, family, and friends about these times so they understand your focus period. This strategy enhances productivity by minimizing disruptions and allows for uninterrupted work sessions.",
    "**Use Productivity Apps**: Explore various apps designed to help manage time and boost productivity. Some popular ones include Trello for task management, Pomodoro timers for focused work sessions, and Forest for eliminating phone distractions. These tools can be customized to fit individual needs and preferences, providing a structured approach to tackling assignments efficiently.",
    "**Break Tasks into Smaller Chunks**: Instead of focusing on the entire assignment at once, break it down into smaller, manageable parts. Set clear objectives for each segment and prioritize them based on importance and deadlines. This method reduces the overwhelming feeling associated with large projects and makes it easier to maintain consistent progress throughout the day.",
    "**Establish a Routine**: Develop a daily routine that includes dedicated blocks of time for studying, working on assignments, and taking breaks. Incorporate elements like morning rituals, midday refueling, and evening wind-downs to create a balanced schedule. Having a predictable routine helps in maintaining focus, managing time effectively, and reduces the temptation to procrastinate. "
