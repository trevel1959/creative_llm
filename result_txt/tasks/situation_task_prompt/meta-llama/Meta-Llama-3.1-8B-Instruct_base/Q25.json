    "**SkyPod System**: A network of pressurized, enclosed tubes, like a high-speed vacuum tube transportation system, would be installed along the exterior of the skyscraper. Each tube would be equipped with a capsule that could be summoned and sent to the desired floor using a smart elevator-like system. The capsules would be propelled through the tubes using magnetic levitation technology, reaching speeds of up to 300 km/h. This system would be powered by solar panels and wind turbines, making it an eco-friendly solution.",
    "**Aerial Walkways**: A network of suspended walkways, supported by high-strength, lightweight materials like carbon fiber or advanced polymers, would be installed between the skyscraper and adjacent buildings or a separate, elevated walkway system. These walkways would be equipped with safety harnesses and could be accessed via staircases or moving walkways. The walkways would be designed to provide a smooth, stable, and secure passage to the top of the skyscraper.",
    "**Zip Line System**: A zip line system would be installed along the exterior of the skyscraper, with multiple zip lines connecting each floor. The zip lines would be made of high-strength, durable materials and would be equipped with safety harnesses and braking systems. Passengers would be secured to the zip line using a secure harness and would be able to zip line from floor to floor, reaching speeds of up to 60 km/h.",
    "**Gravity-Defying Staircases**: A system of staircases would be installed within the skyscraper, using advanced materials and designs to minimize the impact of gravity. The staircases would be designed to create a sense of weightlessness, using a combination of curved and inclined surfaces to reduce the effort required to climb. The staircases would be equipped with safety features like handrails and emergency brakes.",
    "**SkyClimb System**: A system of vertical, spiral staircases would be installed within the skyscraper, using advanced materials and designs to minimize the impact of gravity. The staircases would be designed to create a sense of adventure and excitement, with features like glass floors and walls, and LED lighting. The staircases would be equipped with safety features like handrails and emergency brakes, and would be accessible via a separate elevator system. [/INST] "
