    "In the Land of Everlasting Night, shadows danced under a sky painted with stars that never twinkled. The inhabitants, nocturnal beings known as Luminas, thrived in the darkness, their skin glowing softly like fireflies. One fateful evening, a young Lumina named Nox discovered an ancient crystal buried deep in the moonlit caves. It pulsed with a warm light, whispering secrets of a long-lost sun. Driven by curiosity, Nox embarked on a quest to awaken the sun, rallying friends along the way. Together, they faced the Shadow Beasts that guarded the light, learning that hope can illuminate even the darkest nights.",
