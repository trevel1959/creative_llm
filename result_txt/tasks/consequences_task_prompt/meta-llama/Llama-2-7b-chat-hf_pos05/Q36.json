    "Enhanced Safety: With the ability to regenerate limbs like starfish, individuals could potentially avoid the risks associated with injuries or amputations. For instance, if someone loses a hand in an accident, they could regrow a new one, reducing the need for prosthetics or other assistive devices.",
    "Increased Mobility: Regenerating limbs would allow people to move more freely and easily, without the limitations of artificial limbs or mobility aids. This could be especially beneficial for individuals with amputations or other mobility impairments.",
    "Enhanced Resilience: The ability to regenerate limbs would make humans more resilient to injury and disease. For example, if someone suffers from a severe burn, they could regrow new skin to replace the damaged tissue, reducing the risk of infection or other complications.",
    "New Forms of Artistic Expression: With the ability to regenerate limbs, artists could explore new forms of creative expression, such as sculpting or painting with their regenerated limbs. This could lead to a new era of artistic innovation and exploration.",
    "Ethical Considerations: The ability to regenerate limbs raises important ethical questions, such as whether or not it is ethical to use this ability for personal gain, or whether it should be reserved for those who are most in need. This could lead to lively debates and discussions about the ethical implications of such a technology."
