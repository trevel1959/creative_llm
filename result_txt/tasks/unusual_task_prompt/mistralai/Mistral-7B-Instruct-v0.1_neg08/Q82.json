    "Create a \"virtual ironing board\" app that uses augmented reality technology to let users iron clothes virtually on their phone screen. The app would use machine learning to recognize different types of fabrics and automatically adjust the ironing settings accordingly. This would allow users to iron their clothes without actually having to use an iron, and could be especially useful for people who don't have access to an iron or who don't have the space to store one.",
    "Develop a \"smart iron\" that uses sensors to detect the type of fabric and adjust the temperature and pressure accordingly. The iron would also have a built-in camera that could be used to take pictures of the clothes being ironed, and the app would use machine learning to suggest the best ironing settings for different types of fabrics. This would make it easier for people to iron their clothes quickly and efficiently, and could also help to reduce the amount of energy used by the iron.",
    "Create a \"smart wardrobe\" that uses machine learning to suggest outfits based on the clothes that are already in the wardrobe. The wardrobe could also have a built-in camera that could be used to take pictures of clothes that are being ironed, and the app would use machine learning to suggest the best ironing settings for different types of fabrics. This would make it easier for people to get dressed in the morning, and could also help to reduce the amount of time and energy spent on ironing.",
    "Develop a \"virtual dressing room\" that uses augmented reality technology to let users try on clothes virtually on their phone screen. The app would use machine learning to recognize different types of fabrics and automatically adjust the lighting and other settings to make the clothes look as realistic as possible. This would allow users to try on clothes without actually having to go to a physical dressing room, and could be especially useful for people who don't have access to a dressing room or who don't have the space to store one.",
    "Create a \"smart laundry service\" that uses machine learning to suggest the best laundry settings for different types of fabrics. The service could also have a built-in camera that could be used to take pictures of clothes that are being ironed, and the app would use machine learning to suggest the best ironing settings for different types of fabrics. This would make it easier for people to do their laundry quickly and efficiently, and could also help to reduce the amount of energy used by the laundry service"
