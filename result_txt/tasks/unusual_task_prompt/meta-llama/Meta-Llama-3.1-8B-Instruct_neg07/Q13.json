    "**Rubber Duck Innovation Incubator**: Create a pop-up innovation lab where participants are given a rubber duck as a symbol of creativity. The lab would be equipped with tools like mind mapping software, brainstorming templates, and design thinking exercises. Participants would be encouraged to think outside the box and come up with innovative solutions to real-world problems. The twist? The rubber duck would be the \"client\" or \"customer\" that participants have to design solutions for. This would add a fun and engaging element to the innovation process, making it more approachable and enjoyable for participants.",
    "**Duck Pond Design Challenge**: Organize a design competition where participants are given a hypothetical scenario, such as designing a sustainable community or a futuristic city. The catch? They have to design it from the perspective of a rubber duck living in the community or city. This would force participants to think creatively and consider the needs and perspectives of different stakeholders, including the rubber duck. The winner would be the participant who comes up with the most innovative and well-designed solution.",
    "**Quacking Good Ideas**: Develop a mobile app that uses AI-powered chatbots to help users generate creative ideas. The twist? The chatbot would be designed to resemble a rubber duck, complete with quacking sounds and animations. Users would be prompted to provide information about their problem or challenge, and the chatbot would use natural language processing to generate a list of potential solutions. The app would also include features like idea validation, feedback, and collaboration tools to help users refine and develop their ideas.",
    "**Rubber Duck Hackathon**: Host a hackathon where participants are given a set of challenges or problems to solve, with a twist: they have to design solutions that incorporate rubber ducks in some way. This could be as simple as creating a product that uses a rubber duck as a key component or as complex as designing a system that uses AI-powered rubber ducks to solve a real-world problem. The hackathon would be a fun and engaging way to encourage creativity and innovation, and the rubber duck element would add an extra layer of complexity and challenge.",
    "**Fowl Play**: Create a board game or card game that encourages players to think creatively and come up with innovative solutions to real-world problems. The game would feature rubber ducks as the main characters, and players would have to navigate through a series of challenges and obstacles to reach the final goal. The twist? The game would include elements of chance and unpredictability, such as random events or \"power"
