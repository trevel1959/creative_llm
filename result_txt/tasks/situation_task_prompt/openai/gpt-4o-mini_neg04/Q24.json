    "**Smartphone Augmented Reality (AR) Glasses**: With the disappearance of traditional glasses, tech companies could pivot to develop AR glasses that utilize smartphone connectivity. These glasses would employ real-time image processing to enhance vision by adjusting contrast, brightness, and even overlaying text for reading. Users could customize their visual experience based on their specific vision needs, with features like zooming in on distant objects or highlighting text.",
    "**Vision-Training Programs**: Community centers and health organizations could offer workshops focused on improving visual acuity through exercises and training techniques. These programs would teach individuals how to strengthen their eye muscles, improve focus, and enhance peripheral vision through activities such as eye yoga, meditation, and visual puzzles, helping people adapt to their new circumstances without corrective lenses.",
    "**Natural Vision Aids**: People could turn to nature for solutions by utilizing certain plants and herbs known for their eye health benefits. Workshops could be held to teach individuals how to prepare herbal teas, infusions, or poultices that support eye health. Additionally, local farmers could cultivate specific crops like bilberries or carrots, known for their beneficial properties for vision, creating a community-based approach to maintaining eye health.",
    "**Community Eye Exchange Programs**: Communities could establish programs where individuals with different vision capabilities pair up to assist each other. For example, someone with excellent vision could help those with poor vision navigate daily tasks or read important information. This exchange would not only foster community spirit but also help individuals with vision impairments adapt by relying on their peers for support.",
    "**DIY Optical Devices**: With the loss of glasses, people could become more inventive and start creating their own optical devices using everyday materials. Workshops could teach individuals how to build simple magnifying devices using items like plastic bottles, lenses from discarded electronics, or even prisms. This DIY approach would encourage creativity and problem-solving while addressing immediate vision needs."
