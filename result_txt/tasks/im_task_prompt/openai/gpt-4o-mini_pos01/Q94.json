    "**Scent-Release Timers**: Introduce candles that release different scents at timed intervals. This could be achieved through a layered design where each layer has a distinct fragrance that is released sequentially as the candle burns. This feature would allow for a more dynamic olfactory experience, transforming the ambiance of a room over time rather than a single scent throughout.",
    "**Eco-Friendly Refill System**: Create a candle design that allows for easy refilling of wax and wicks. Customers could purchase refill packs of different scents and colors, reducing waste and encouraging sustainability. The refillable design could also include customizable molds for creating unique shapes or designs that reflect personal style.",
    "**Interactive Candle Holders**: Design candle holders that react to the flame or wax. For example, holders could have built-in LED lights that change color based on the candle's flame intensity or flicker in response to the candle's burn. This would add an interactive element to the candle experience, creating a visual display that complements the flickering light of the flame.",
    "**Mood-Enhancing Candles with Embedded Crystals**: Infuse candles with crystals that correspond to different emotional or spiritual benefits. For example, a candle with amethyst could promote calmness, while one with citrine could enhance creativity. As the candle burns, the crystals could be revealed, serving as a decorative element and a reminder of the candle's intended purpose.",
    "**Multi-Sensory Candles**: Create candles that engage multiple senses beyond just sight and smell. Incorporate elements like sound (soft chimes or nature sounds) that activate as the candle burns or even textures on the candle holder that can be touched. This could enhance relaxation and create a more immersive experience, making the candle a centerpiece for mindfulness or meditation practices."
