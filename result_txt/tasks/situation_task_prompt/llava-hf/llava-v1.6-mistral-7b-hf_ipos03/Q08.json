    "**Underground Aquifers**: Another solution could be to tap into underground aquifers, which are naturally occurring underground water sources. Aquifers can be located beneath the surface and are replenished by rainwater. To access these aquifers, deep wells could be drilled and the water extracted, ensuring a clean source of drinking water.",
    "**Water Filtration Systems**: Developing advanced water filtration systems could also be a viable solution. These systems would be designed to remove pollutants and contaminants from polluted water sources, making them safe for drinking. This could involve using nanotechnology or other advanced filtering methods to create a highly effective filtration system.",
    "**Rainwater Harvesting**: Rainwater harvesting is a technique that involves collecting and storing rainwater for later use. By installing rainwater harvesting systems on rooftops and other surfaces, clean drinking water could be collected and stored for future use. This would require the development of efficient storage solutions to ensure the water remains clean and safe.",
    "**Desalination of Seawater**: Desalination of seawater is a process that removes salt and other minerals from seawater to produce clean drinking water. This could be a viable solution if all freshwater sources are polluted. Desalination plants could be built near coastal areas to provide a clean source of drinking water.",
    "**Water Recycling**: Another solution could be to develop advanced water recycling systems that recycle wastewater back into clean drinking water. This would involve creating a closed-loop system that removes pollutants and contaminants from wastewater and then purifies it for reuse."
