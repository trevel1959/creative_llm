    "Upholstered Headrest: One creative solution would be to use an upholstered headrest. This could be a small, cushioned rest with a soft, plush cover that can be placed on top of a bed or sofa. The headrest could be designed with a unique shape or contour to provide optimal support and comfort for the head and neck.",
    "Balloon Pillow: Another idea is to use a balloon as a makeshift pillow. By inflating a balloon to the desired firmness, it could provide a soft, cushioned surface for resting the head. This solution could be especially useful for people who prefer a softer pillow but don't have access to one.",
    "Memory Foam Cradle: For a more luxurious solution, a memory foam cradle could be used to rest the head. Memory foam is designed to conform to the shape of the head and neck, providing excellent support and pressure relief. The cradle could be made of a soft, breathable material and could be placed on top of a bed or sofa.",
    "Buckwheat Hull Pillow: Another creative solution is to use a buckwheat hull pillow. Buckwheat hulls are a natural, eco-friendly material that provides excellent support and pressure relief. The pillow can be filled with buckwheat hulls and molded to the desired shape for optimal comfort.",
    "Sleep Mask and Earplugs: For people who have difficulty sleeping due to external factors such as light or noise, a sleep mask and earplugs could be used to create a more peaceful sleeping environment. A sleep mask can block out light, while earplugs can muffle sounds. This solution is particularly useful for people who have trouble falling asleep or staying asleep due to external distractions."
