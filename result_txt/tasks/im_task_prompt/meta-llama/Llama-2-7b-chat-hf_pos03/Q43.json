    "Smart Oven: Develop an oven that can automatically adjust cooking time and temperature based on the type of food being cooked. This oven would use sensors to detect the food's temperature and moisture levels, and adjust the cooking settings accordingly. This would ensure that food is cooked to the perfect temperature and texture every time.",
    "Oven with Built-In Food Scale: Design an oven with a built-in food scale that can measure the weight of food before and during cooking. This would allow users to accurately measure the amount of food they are cooking, ensuring that portions are consistent and healthy.",
    "Oven with Multi-Function Cooking Modes: Create an oven with multiple cooking modes, such as baking, roasting, broiling, and grilling. Each mode would have its own unique cooking parameters, such as temperature and time, that can be easily selected using a touchscreen display.",
    "Oven with Automatic Cooking Recipe Suggestions: Develop an oven with a built-in recipe database that can suggest cooking recipes based on the type of food being cooked. Users could simply select the type of food they are cooking, and the oven would provide a list of suggested recipes with detailed instructions.",
    "Oven with Augmented Reality Cooking Display: Design an oven with an augmented reality (AR) display that can show users how to cook a particular dish. The display would use AR technology to superimpose cooking instructions and visual aids onto the user's kitchen, making it easier to follow along and cook with confidence."
