    "**Atmospheric Water Harvesting (AWH) System**: Implement a network of mist collectors that utilize condensation to capture water vapor from the air. These collectors would be strategically placed in areas with high humidity, such as near bodies of water or in tropical regions. The collected water would then be channeled into a central storage system, providing a sustainable source of drinking water.",
    "**Solar-Powered Water Distillation**: Design a system that utilizes solar energy to evaporate water from a saltwater source, then condenses it back into fresh water. This process would be facilitated by a network of solar stills, which would be placed in areas with high solar irradiance. The distilled water would be collected and stored for later use.",
    "**Water-Evaporation-Based Desalination**: Develop a system that utilizes a combination of solar energy and a specialized membrane to desalinate seawater. This would involve creating a large, shallow pool that allows seawater to evaporate, then collecting the condensed water vapor through a network of condenser tubes. The condensed water would be fresh and free of salt.",
    "**Fog Collection Nets**: Design and deploy large, mesh nets that are capable of capturing fog droplets as they form and fall. These nets would be placed in areas where fog is prevalent, such as coastal regions or mountainous terrain. The collected water would then be channeled into a central storage system, providing a reliable source of drinking water.",
    "**Bio-Inspired Water Collection**: Develop a system that mimics the way certain plants collect water from the air, such as the \"living wall\" concept. This would involve creating a structure with a large surface area, covered in a specialized membrane that can absorb and store water from the air. The collected water would then be channeled into a central storage system, providing a sustainable source of drinking water.
