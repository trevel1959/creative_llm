    "Vertical Garden High-Rise: Create a high-rise building that incorporates a lush green vertical garden, providing a natural oasis in the midst of the bustling city. The garden can be designed to include a variety of plants, herbs, and flowers, and can be maintained through a hydroponic system, reducing water consumption and improving air quality. The building can also include a rooftop restaurant with a glass ceiling, offering breathtaking views of the city skyline and the green oasis within.",
    "Energy-Harvesting High-Rise: Design a high-rise building that harnesses energy from the environment to power its operations. The building can be equipped with solar panels, wind turbines, and other renewable energy sources to generate electricity. The energy generated can be stored in batteries or fed back into the grid, reducing the building's carbon footprint and reliance on non-renewable energy sources. The building can also incorporate smart energy management systems to optimize energy usage and reduce waste.",
    "Adaptive High-Rise: Create a high-rise building that can adapt to changing environmental conditions, such as earthquakes, hurricanes, and floods. The building can be designed with a modular structure, allowing for easy reconfiguration of the building's layout and components in response to changing conditions. The building can also include advanced sensors and monitoring systems to detect and respond to environmental changes in real-time. This can provide greater resilience and safety for occupants, while also reducing the need for costly repairs and renovations.",
    "Bioluminescent High-Rise: Design a high-rise building that incorporates bioluminescent materials to create a unique and sustainable lighting system. The building can be designed with specialized light-emitting materials that can be programmed to produce different colors and patterns, providing a dynamic and visually striking lighting display. The bioluminescent materials can also provide energy savings by reducing the need for traditional lighting sources. The building can also incorporate other sustainable features, such as rainwater harvesting and energy-efficient HVAC systems, to further reduce its environmental impact.",
    "Vertical Farm High-Rise: Create a high-rise building that functions as a vertical farm,"
