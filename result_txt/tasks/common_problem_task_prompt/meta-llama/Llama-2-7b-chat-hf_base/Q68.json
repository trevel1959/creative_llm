    "\"Sail-O-Vision\": A wearable headset that uses AI to enhance the sailor's vision, providing real-time information on wind patterns, wave heights, and other vital sailing data. This would allow sailors to navigate more efficiently and safely, even in challenging weather conditions.",
    "\"Auto-Pilot 3000\": An advanced autopilot system that utilizes machine learning algorithms to optimize sailboat navigation. By analyzing real-time weather data and sailing patterns, the system can adjust sail angles, speed, and direction to minimize fuel consumption and reduce sailing time.",
    "\"Sail-Trac\": A digital tracing system that tracks the sailboat's path and displays it on a virtual map in real-time. This would allow sailors to see their exact position and trajectory, making it easier to navigate and avoid collisions.",
    "\"Sail-Cam\": A camera system that provides a bird's-eye view of the sailboat's surroundings, allowing sailors to detect potential hazards such as other boats, rocks, and debris. The camera can also be used to capture stunning aerial footage of the ocean and surrounding landscapes.",
    "\"Sail-Song\": A music-based navigation system that uses sonar technology to detect the sailboat's surroundings. By analyzing the sound waves reflected off nearby objects, the system can determine the sailboat's position and trajectory, providing an alternative to traditional navigation methods. This would be particularly useful in poor weather conditions or when visibility is limited."
