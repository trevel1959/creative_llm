    "**Integrated Communication System**: A helmet designed with built-in Bluetooth technology that allows cyclists to communicate with each other or take calls hands-free. This system could include noise-cancellation features to minimize wind and background noise, enabling clear conversations. Additionally, the helmet could be paired with a companion app that tracks rides and allows group chats for cyclists in a pack.",
    "**Climate-Controlled Ventilation**: This innovative helmet could feature a climate control system that adjusts airflow based on the rider's body temperature and external conditions. It would use sensors to detect heat and humidity levels, activating small fans or vents to provide cooling airflow, ensuring comfort during long rides in varying weather conditions.",
    "**Modular Safety Features**: A helmet that allows for customizable safety attachments, such as removable visors, rear lights, or reflective panels. This modular approach would enable cyclists to adapt their helmets for different riding conditions, whether commuting at night, riding in the rain, or cycling in bright sunlight. The ability to easily swap out components would also make it more sustainable and cost-effective.",
    "**Biometric Health Monitoring**: A helmet that includes biometric sensors to monitor the rider's heart rate, temperature, and even blood oxygen levels. This data could be displayed on a small screen or sent to a connected app, providing insights into the rider's physical condition. In case of an accident, the helmet could automatically alert emergency contacts with the rider's location and health status.",
    "**Eco-Friendly Materials and Design**: A bicycle helmet made from sustainable, biodegradable materials that provide the same level of protection as traditional helmets. The design could incorporate recycled plastics or natural fibers, appealing to environmentally conscious cyclists. Additionally, the helmet could be produced using low-impact manufacturing processes, reducing its carbon footprint."
