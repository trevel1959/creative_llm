    "**Adjustable Support Zones**: Design a bed with customizable support zones that can be adjusted for different parts of the body. Using inflatable or mechanical components, users can modify the firmness of specific areas (e.g., lumbar support, leg support) to suit their personal comfort needs. This feature could be controlled via a smartphone app, allowing users to easily make adjustments while in bed.",
    "**Built-in Sleep Sound System**: Create a bed with a built-in sound system that plays soothing sounds, white noise, or guided meditations to help users fall asleep. The system could be programmed to turn off after a set time or gradually lower the volume as the user falls asleep. It could also connect to streaming services, allowing users to choose their preferred sounds or sleep stories.",
    "**Multi-functional Bed Frame**: Develop a bed frame that serves multiple purposes. For example, the frame could include built-in storage compartments for clothes or bedding, a fold-out desk for work or study, and integrated lighting that can be adjusted for reading or ambiance. This would maximize space in smaller rooms and provide additional functionality.",
    "**Personalized Mattress Technology**: Innovate a mattress that adapts to the sleeper's body shape and sleeping position using advanced materials like memory foam with variable density. This mattress could also have embedded sensors that detect pressure points and adjust its firmness in real-time, ensuring that the sleeper receives the best support throughout the night.",
    "**Mood-Enhancing Lighting**: Incorporate adjustable LED lighting into the bed frame that changes colors and brightness based on the time of day or user preference. For instance, soft blue or green lights could be used in the evening to promote relaxation, while brighter white lights could be activated in the morning to simulate sunlight and help users wake up more naturally."
