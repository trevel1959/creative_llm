    "**Solar-Powered Light Drones**: Deploy fleets of solar-powered drones equipped with high-intensity LED lights. These drones could fly in designated patterns to mimic sunlight, providing illumination to homes and public spaces. The drones would be programmed to adjust their brightness based on the time of day and weather conditions, ensuring a consistent and adaptable light source.",
    "**Reflective Urban Structures**: Redesign urban architecture using reflective materials that can bounce and diffuse light from artificial sources. Buildings could be constructed with surfaces that capture light from street lamps, neon signs, or other artificial sources and redirect it into the surrounding areas, creating a brighter urban environment without relying on direct sunlight.",
    "**Light Harvesting Fabrics**: Create clothing and accessories made from advanced photoluminescent materials that absorb light during the day and glow in the dark. These garments could be designed to be both fashionable and functional, allowing people to carry their own source of light wherever they go, effectively making everyone a walking light source.",
    "**Community Light Stations**: Establish community light stations powered by renewable energy sources, such as wind or hydroelectric power. These stations would be equipped with high-powered LED lights and could be activated by residents. This communal approach would encourage collaboration and provide a reliable light source, while also fostering community spirit and resilience.",
    "**Augmented Reality Light Apps**: Develop an augmented reality (AR) application that overlays virtual light sources onto the real world through smartphones or AR glasses. Users could see illuminated paths, objects, and areas, effectively enhancing visibility in their surroundings. This could be particularly useful for navigation and safety in urban environments."
