I'd have to rely on other clues, like the position of the sun, the wind direction, and the temperature. I'd say, it's going to be a sunny day! 🌞 But wait, what's that? The sun is shining brightly, but there's a strange glow in the distance... Hmm, could be a storm brewing! 🌪️\"",
    "\"If there were no more clouds, I'd have to get creative with my weather forecasting! I'd use my trusty crystal ball to gaze into the future and see what the weather will be like. 🔮💫 Maybe I'd see visions of sunshine and rainbows, or perhaps a hint of a storm on the horizon. Either way, I'd make sure to share my psychic predictions with the world! 💫👀\"",
    "\"Oh, no! Without clouds, I'd be lost without my trusty weather app! 😱 But fear not, I've got a backup plan! I'd use my time-traveling device to go back in time and observe the weather patterns of the past. That way, I could predict the future with absolute certainty! 🕰️🔮 Of course, there's always the chance of running into a dinosaur or two... 🦖😅\"",
    "\"If clouds were gone, I'd have to rely on my vast knowledge of astronomy to predict the weather! 🌠 I'd study the positions of the stars and planets, and use that information to determine the weather patterns. It might take a little more effort, but with my skills, I'd be able to accurately predict the weather like a pro! 💫🔮\"",
    "\"Oh no, no clouds?! 🤯 Well, I'd have to get a little unconventional with my weather forecasting! I'd use my trusty pet hamster, Mr. Fluffers, to predict the weather! 🐹💨"
