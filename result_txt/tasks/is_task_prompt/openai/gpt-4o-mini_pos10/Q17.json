Moved by the art, they pledged to protect the oceans.

One night, as she sculpted under the stars, a magical breeze carried her whispers to the heavens. In response, the clouds swirled, and rain poured down, flooding the dry land. Lila’s sculptures washed away, but from the depths, the ocean rose again, reclaiming its place and filling the air with the scent of salt.",
