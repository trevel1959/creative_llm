    "**Robotic Buddy for Newcomers**: Design a friendly robot that assists new students in navigating their first day at school. This robot can provide directions, help them find their classrooms, and even make introductions to other students. It can also offer tips on how to make friends or handle situations they might find challenging. The robot's approachable and non-threatening design can help ease the anxiety of starting a new environment.",
    "**Interactive Storytelling Station**: Create a digital storytelling station where the robot acts as a narrator. Students can interact with this station by choosing story elements, characters, and plot twists. The robot adapts the story based on these choices, providing an engaging and personalized learning experience. This can help improve creativity and critical thinking skills while also making the first day more enjoyable.",
    "**Robot-led Icebreaker Activities**: Develop interactive games led by robots to encourage socialization among new students. For example, a robot could lead a \"Human Bingo\" game where students need to interact with others to complete their cards. This not only helps in breaking the ice but also promotes teamwork and communication skills.",
    "**Personalized Learning Pathways**: Utilize AI capabilities within the robot to assess each student's learning style and interests. Based on this data, the robot can recommend personalized learning activities and resources tailored to each student's needs. This ensures that the learning experience is both effective and engaging from the very beginning.",
    "**Emotional Support System**: Implement a system where the robot can detect emotional cues from students and provide appropriate support. If a student appears upset or overwhelmed, the robot can initiate calming exercises, such as guided breathing or play soothing music. Additionally, it can remind students to take breaks when needed, helping to maintain their mental well-being throughout the day. "
