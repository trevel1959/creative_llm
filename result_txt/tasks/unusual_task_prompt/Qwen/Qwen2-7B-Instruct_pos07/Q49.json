    "**Interactive Picture Frame**: Create a picture frame that can interact with digital devices such as smartphones or tablets. This frame would have built-in Bluetooth technology, allowing users to scan a QR code on the back of their device and instantly view photos from their phone on the frame. The frame could also be used as a smart home hub, displaying notifications and controlling smart home devices.",
    "**3D Printing Picture Frame**: Develop a picture frame that utilizes 3D printing technology. Users can upload a 3D model of their choice (like a character, logo, or intricate design) to create a personalized and unique frame for their artwork. This would allow for customization beyond traditional frame styles and colors.",
    "**Solar-Powered Picture Frame**: Design a picture frame that incorporates solar panels into its structure. This eco-friendly frame would not only display photographs but also charge itself using sunlight, reducing energy consumption and environmental impact. It could even power small electronic devices or accessories attached to it, like a small Bluetooth speaker or USB port.",
    "**Light-Controlling Picture Frame**: Create a picture frame that includes LED lighting within its structure. Users can control the color and brightness of the lights through an accompanying app, creating a dynamic ambiance for the displayed artwork. This feature could be especially appealing for art exhibitions or events where the lighting needs to adapt to different moods or times of day.",
    "**Augmented Reality Picture Frame**: Build a picture frame that integrates augmented reality (AR) technology. When a user views a photo through the frame, they can interact with digital elements superimposed onto the image, like adding filters, animations, or even virtual objects. This would transform static photos into interactive experiences, enhancing engagement and enjoyment."
