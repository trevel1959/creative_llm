Driftwood could be carved into intricate shapes and designs, while shells could be strung together to form necklaces and bracelets. Pebbles could be polished and arranged in patterns to create statement pieces.",
    "Recycled Materials Ornaments: Ornaments could also be created using recycled materials such as old CDs, plastic bottles, and newspaper.
