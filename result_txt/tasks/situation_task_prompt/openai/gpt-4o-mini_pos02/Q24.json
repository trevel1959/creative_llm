    "**Vision-Enhancing AR Glasses**: In the absence of traditional eyewear, augmented reality (AR) glasses could be developed that not only enhance vision but also provide real-time information about the environment. These glasses would use cameras and sensors to analyze the surroundings, magnifying objects, adjusting colors for better contrast, and even providing audio descriptions of the environment. Users could customize the display settings to suit their vision needs, effectively creating a personalized visual experience.",
    "**Vision Training Apps**: Launch a series of mobile apps focused on vision training exercises designed to improve eye coordination and strengthen vision over time. These apps would use engaging games and activities that challenge users' visual acuity, depth perception, and focus. By promoting regular use of these exercises, individuals could potentially enhance their natural vision capabilities, making daily life more manageable without corrective lenses.",
    "**Biodegradable Eye Drops**: Create a line of biodegradable eye drops that contain nutrients and compounds to improve eye health and potentially enhance vision. These drops could be formulated with ingredients that reduce eye strain, improve focus, and promote better overall eye function. Regular use of these drops could help people with poor vision maintain better sight and reduce reliance on corrective lenses.",
    "**Community Vision Hubs**: Establish community centers where individuals with vision impairments can access a range of resources, including vision training programs, adaptive technology, and peer support groups. These hubs would provide a space for people to share experiences, learn about coping strategies, and access tools that help them navigate daily life without glasses or contacts, fostering a sense of community and empowerment.",
    "**Natural Vision Correction Workshops**: Organize workshops that teach individuals about natural vision correction techniques, such as eye exercises, proper nutrition for eye health, and mindfulness practices that reduce eye strain. Participants would learn how to integrate these techniques into their daily routines, potentially improving their vision over time. These workshops could also emphasize the importance of regular eye care and the impact of lifestyle choices on vision."
