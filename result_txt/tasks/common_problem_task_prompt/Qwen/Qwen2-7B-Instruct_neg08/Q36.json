    "**Community Solar Garden**: Create a large-scale solar installation within a community park or designated area, accessible to all residents. This allows those who may not have space for individual panels on their homes to still benefit from renewable energy. It can also serve as an educational hub for teaching about solar energy production, sustainability, and its environmental impact.",
    "**Solar-Enhanced Public Transportation**: Integrate solar power into the city's public transportation system. Buses, trams, and even subways could be equipped with solar panels that charge while in operation. This not only reduces the carbon footprint of public transport but also serves as a visible example of how solar energy can be integrated into daily life.",
    "**Interactive Solar Panels**: Develop a series of interactive public art installations that double as solar panels. These could be murals, sculptures, or other artistic pieces that incorporate solar technology. They would serve dual purposes - providing clean energy and adding aesthetic value to the cityscape. ",
    "**Green Roofs and Solar Integration**: Encourage the use of green roofs in new buildings and renovations. Not only do these offer insulation benefits and improve urban biodiversity, but they can also be equipped with solar panels. This would increase the overall energy efficiency of buildings while promoting a greener city environment.",
    "**Solar-Powered Community Services**: Implement solar energy in essential community services like water purification plants, community centers, and libraries. This ensures that these critical services are powered by renewable energy sources, further reducing the city's dependence on fossil fuels. Additionally, it can lead to cost savings over time, which can then be reinvested into other community projects."
