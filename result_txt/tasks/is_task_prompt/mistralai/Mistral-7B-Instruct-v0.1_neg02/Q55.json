    "\"I'm not sure why we expected you to handle something this challenging. Perhaps it's because you have the ability to adapt and solve complex problems, like the octopus with only seven arms.\"",
    "\"Maybe we underestimated the intelligence and resourcefulness of octopuses. Even with only seven arms, they are still capable of achieving great feats.\"",
    "\"It's possible that we were influenced by the idea of perfectionism. We assumed that an octopus with seven arms would be unable to perform certain tasks, but we were wrong.\"",
    "\"Perhaps we were simply too focused on the number of arms and not on the other abilities that octopuses possess. They have a remarkable memory, can change color, and can even regenerate their arms.\"",
    "\"It's possible that we were trying to compare octopuses to humans and assumed that they needed a full set of limbs to perform certain tasks. But octopuses are not like humans and have evolved to be able to function with fewer arms.\""
