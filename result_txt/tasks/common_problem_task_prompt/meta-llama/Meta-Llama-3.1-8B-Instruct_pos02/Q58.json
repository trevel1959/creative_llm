    "**AI-Powered Threat Detection System**: Implement an AI-driven threat detection system that uses machine learning algorithms to analyze network traffic, identify patterns, and detect potential security threats in real-time. This system would be able to learn from the company's specific network behavior and adapt to new threats as they emerge. The AI system would be integrated with the company's existing security infrastructure, providing a comprehensive security solution that is proactive and reactive.",
    "**Zero-Trust Network Architecture**: Design a zero-trust network architecture that assumes all users and devices are potential threats, regardless of their location or identity. This approach would involve implementing micro-segmentation, where each application and service is isolated and secured, and only authorized traffic is allowed to flow between them. This would prevent lateral movement of threats within the network and ensure that even if one part of the network is compromised, the rest of the network remains secure.",
    "**Secure Data Lake**: Develop a secure data lake that stores sensitive data in a centralized repository, while ensuring that access is strictly controlled and monitored. This would involve implementing a data governance framework that defines data classification, access controls, and encryption policies. The data lake would also include a data analytics platform that provides insights into data usage and helps identify potential security risks.",
    "**Cybersecurity Awareness Training**: Design a comprehensive cybersecurity awareness training program that educates employees on the latest security threats, best practices, and company policies. This program would involve interactive training sessions, phishing simulations, and regular security awareness campaigns to keep employees informed and engaged. The program would also include a reward system to encourage employees to report security incidents and participate in security initiatives.",
    "**Advanced Threat Hunting**: Develop an advanced threat hunting program that proactively identifies and eliminates potential security threats within the company's network. This would involve using advanced threat hunting tools and techniques, such as behavioral analysis and memory analysis, to detect and analyze potential threats. The program would also include a threat intelligence feed that provides real-time information on emerging threats and vulnerabilities. [/INST] "
