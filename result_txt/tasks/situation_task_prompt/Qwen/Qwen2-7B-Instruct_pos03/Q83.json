    "**Incorporating Light Therapy**: One creative solution could involve using light therapy. The body naturally releases melatonin in response to darkness, which helps regulate our sleep cycle. In a world without night-time, one could use devices or rooms that mimic the darkness needed for melatonin production. These could be in the form of specialized glasses, room enclosures, or even wearable tech that emits blue light-blocking wavelengths.",
    "**Adapting to a 24/7 Daylight Cycle**: Humans have evolved to adapt to various lighting conditions over thousands of years. In a world without night, we could gradually adapt by increasing our exposure to sunlight during the day and reducing artificial light exposure in the evening. This adaptation might require significant lifestyle changes, such as moving activities outdoors during \"daytime\" hours, and incorporating more natural light sources into our homes and workplaces.",
    "**Creating a Sleep-Oriented Culture**: Establishing a new cultural norm where people prioritize sleep and rest during the \"day\" (which is now essentially all the time) could lead to innovative practices. This might include creating communal spaces dedicated to sleep, developing new forms of entertainment that don't disrupt sleep cycles, or even designing new types of clothing and bedding optimized for continuous sleep.",
    "**Developing New Sleep Technologies**: With the absence of night-time, there would be a high demand for technology that can help manage sleep patterns. This could include smart sleep masks that adjust their light output based on individual circadian rhythms, sleep-tracking devices that monitor brain waves continuously to detect when sleep begins and ends, or even virtual reality environments that simulate calming night-time scenes to induce sleep.",
    "**Innovative Sleep-Aiding Substances**: Given the importance of sleep in this new scenario, there could be a push for developing new substances that aid in sleep. This might involve creating supplements that enhance sleep quality, drugs that regulate sleep patterns without relying on natural nighttime cues, or even new forms of therapy that address sleep disorders in a 24/7 environment. Research in these areas could lead to breakthroughs in pharmacology and sleep medicine."
