    "**Modular Piano Design**: Create a modular piano where users can easily swap out different components, such as the keyboard, sound module, or even the body style. This would allow musicians to customize their instrument based on their playing style or genre preferences. For instance, a jazz musician might prefer a different key touch or sound module than a classical pianist, enabling a tailored experience.",
    "**Augmented Reality Learning Tool**: Develop an augmented reality (AR) app that projects visual guides onto the piano keys, helping beginners learn to play. The app could show which keys to press in real-time, highlight scales, and provide visual feedback on timing and rhythm. This would create an immersive learning environment that combines physical and digital elements, making practice sessions more fun and effective.",
    "**Integrated Recording and Sharing System**: Equip the piano with built-in recording capabilities and a simple interface for sharing performances directly to social media or music platforms. Musicians could easily record their sessions, edit them with basic effects, and share their music with friends or followers. This would encourage collaboration and provide a platform for aspiring artists to showcase their talent.",
    "**Sustainable Materials and Eco-Friendly Design**: Innovate the piano using sustainable materials, such as bamboo or recycled woods, while maintaining high-quality sound. Additionally, incorporate energy-efficient electronics for digital pianos, reducing the carbon footprint. This would appeal to environmentally conscious musicians and promote sustainability in the music industry.",
    "**Piano with Adaptive Touch Sensitivity**: Create a piano that adjusts its touch sensitivity based on the player's style. For instance, if a player is practicing a soft, delicate piece, the piano could become more sensitive to lighter touches, while it could provide more resistance for powerful, dynamic pieces. This feature would enhance the expressive capabilities of the instrument and help players develop their unique sound."
