    "**Legal Liability and Insurance Challenges**: The question of liability in the event of an accident involving a self-driving car is complex. If the car is at fault, is the manufacturer liable, or is it the owner? Insurance policies may need to be restructured to account for these new types of vehicles, leading to confusion and potential disputes over claims. Owners may find it challenging to navigate this new landscape of legal and insurance implications.",
    "**Ethical Dilemmas in Decision-Making**: Self-driving cars are programmed to make split-second decisions in emergency situations. This raises ethical questions about how these vehicles should react in scenarios where harm is unavoidable, such as deciding between the safety of passengers versus pedestrians. Owners may feel uncomfortable with the moral implications of these decisions made by algorithms.",
    "**Maintenance and Repair Issues**: While self-driving cars are designed to be low-maintenance, they are still complex machines that require regular software updates and hardware checks. Finding qualified technicians who understand the intricacies of autonomous technology can be challenging. Additionally, if a self-driving car experiences a malfunction, it may require specialized repairs that are not widely available, leading to potential downtime for the owner.",
    "**Public Perception and Acceptance**: Despite the technological advancements, many people are still skeptical about self-driving cars. Owners may face judgment or concern from friends, family, or other drivers about their choice to use an autonomous vehicle. This societal hesitation can lead to social pressure and affect the owner's confidence in using the technology.",
    "**Impact on Driving Skills**: Relying on a self-driving car could lead to a decline in traditional driving skills. If owners become too accustomed to letting the car handle all driving responsibilities, they may struggle to take control in emergency situations or when required to drive manually. This loss of driving competency could pose safety risks and diminish the owner's confidence behind the wheel."
