    "Food -axizax: Another potential problem that may arise in a zoo setting is the issue of food -axizax, where animals become so used to the food they are given that they stop eating or become picky eaters. This can lead to health issues and even death if the animals are not properly cared for.",
    "Safety -axizax: Running a zoo also requires ensuring the safety of both the animals and the visitors. One potential problem that may arise is the issue of safety -axizax, where visitors become so comfortable in the zoo environment that they forget to follow safety rules or become complacent about the potential dangers of interacting with the animals. This can lead to accidents and injuries.",
    "Conservation -axizax: A zoo can also serve as a platform for conservation efforts, but one potential problem that may arise is the issue of conservation -axizax, where animals are kept in captivity for breeding or research purposes but are not properly cared for or given enough space. This can lead to -axizax and other health issues, and can also impact the conservation efforts themselves.",
    "Education -axizax: A zoo can also serve as an educational tool, but one potential problem that may arise is the issue of education -axizax, where visitors are not properly educated about the animals they are interacting with or the conservation efforts being made. This can lead to a lack of understanding and appreciation for the animals and their environment.",
    "Costs -axizax: Running a zoo can be a costly endeavor, and one potential problem that may arise is the issue of costs -axizax, where the costs of running the zoo, such as food, veterinary care, and maintenance, become too high to sustain. This can lead to financial strain and potentially even closure of the zoo."
