    "Texture: If colors disappeared, we can differentiate between objects based on their texture. We can touch or feel the objects to determine their shape, smoothness, roughness, and other tactile features.",
    "Shape: We can differentiate between objects based on their shape. We can observe the objects from different angles and determine their dimensions, angles, and curves.",
    "Size: We can differentiate between objects based on their size. We can compare the objects to each other and determine which one is larger or smaller.",
    "Sound: We can differentiate between objects based on their sound. We can listen to the objects and determine their shape, size, and material based on the sound they make.",
    "Smell: We can differentiate between objects based on their smell. We can smell the objects and determine their material, texture, and shape based on the scent they emit."
