    "**Innovative Magnet-Based Sorting System**: Create a sorting system that utilizes magnets to separate different materials based on their magnetic properties. For example, in recycling plants or scrap metal processing, magnets can be used to separate ferromagnetic materials from non-magnetic ones. This system could involve conveyor belts with embedded magnets that attract and sort materials automatically.",
    "**Magnetic Field Visualization**: Develop a device that uses magnetic fields to create a visual representation of the environment around it. This can be particularly useful in scientific research, exploration, or underwater navigation where magnetic anomalies are crucial for mapping or locating objects. The device could project magnetic field lines or strength indicators onto a screen or helmet display for the user.",
    "**Magnetic Personal Assistance Device**: Design a wearable tech gadget that uses magnets to assist individuals with disabilities. For instance, someone with limited hand mobility could use a magnetic bracelet to pick up small items or hold objects steady. This device would feature a magnetic sensor that detects nearby objects and a motorized mechanism to manipulate them.",
    "**Educational Magnetic Board Game**: Create an interactive board game that teaches children about magnetism through play. The game could involve various magnetic challenges such as creating circuits, building structures, or solving puzzles that require understanding of how magnets attract and repel each other. This educational tool would make learning about physics fun and engaging.",
    "**Smart Magnet Door Lock System**: Design a smart home security system that uses magnets to secure doors and windows. The system could include magnetic sensors that detect when a door or window is opened and trigger an alarm or send an alert to the homeowner's smartphone. It could also incorporate a biometric authentication feature where magnets interact with RFID tags for secure access control."
