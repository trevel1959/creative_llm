    "**Adjustable Blade Angle Scissors**: Design scissors with a mechanism that allows the user to adjust the angle of the blades. This would enable users to make precise cuts at different angles without having to twist their wrists awkwardly. This feature would be especially beneficial for artists and professionals in fields like tailoring or crafting.",
    "**Ergonomic Grip with Pressure Sensors**: Create scissors with an ergonomic grip that includes pressure sensors to monitor how hard the user is squeezing. If the pressure exceeds a certain threshold, the scissors could alert the user with a gentle vibration, helping to prevent hand fatigue and repetitive strain injuries. This would be ideal for individuals who use scissors for extended periods.",
    "**Multi-Function Scissors**: Combine traditional scissors with other tools, such as a built-in ruler, a small cutting mat, and a retractable blade for utility cutting. This all-in-one tool would be perfect for crafters and DIY enthusiasts, allowing them to carry just one tool for multiple tasks instead of a whole toolbox.",
    "**Self-Sharpening Scissors**: Develop scissors with a built-in self-sharpening mechanism that uses a ceramic or diamond-coated surface to keep the blades sharp with every cut. This would eliminate the need for manual sharpening and ensure that the scissors are always ready for use, enhancing efficiency and prolonging the life of the tool.",
    "**Color-Coded Cutting Guides**: Introduce scissors with interchangeable blades that have color-coded cutting guides for different types of cuts (e.g., straight, zigzag, decorative). This would allow users to quickly switch between styles without needing multiple pairs of scissors, making it easier to create intricate designs in crafts and scrapbooking."
