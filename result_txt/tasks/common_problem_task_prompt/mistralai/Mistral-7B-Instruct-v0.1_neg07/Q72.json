    "Modular Solar Power Plant: A modular solar power plant can be built in sections, allowing for easy expansion and customization. Each module can be installed independently, making the construction process more efficient and cost-effective. Additionally, the use of pre-manufactured components can reduce the time and cost of construction.",
    "Floating Wind Turbines: Floating wind turbines can be installed in bodies of water, such as lakes or oceans. These turbines can be built using lightweight materials and buoyancy systems, allowing them to be easily transported and installed. Additionally, the use of floating turbines can reduce the environmental impact of wind energy production.",
    "Biomass Power Plant: A biomass power plant can be built using organic waste materials, such as agricultural waste, wood chips, and municipal waste. These materials can be converted into energy through a process called combustion or gasification. Biomass power plants can be built using existing infrastructure, such as waste management facilities, making the construction process more efficient.",
    "Geothermal Power Plant: A geothermal power plant can be built using the heat from the Earth's interior. This heat can be harnessed through the use of geothermal reservoirs, which are underground deposits of hot water and steam. Geothermal power plants can be built using existing infrastructure, such as oil and gas wells, making the construction process more efficient.",
    "Tidal Power Plant: A tidal power plant can be built using the energy generated by the movement of tides. Tidal turbines can be installed in bodies of water, such as estuaries or bays, where the tidal range is significant. Tidal power plants can be built using existing infrastructure, such as ports and harbors, making the construction process more efficient."
