    "Smart Sunglasses: Develop a pair of sunglasses with embedded technology that can monitor and analyze the wearer's eye health, detecting potential problems such as cataracts, glaucoma, or age-related macular degeneration. The glasses could also include features like augmented reality displays, voice assistants, or even a built-in camera for hands-free selfies.",
    "Glow-in-the-Dark Sunglasses: Create a pair of sunglasses that emit a soft, blue-tinted glow in low-light environments. This could be achieved through the use of special lenses that absorb and re-emit light, or through the integration of tiny LEDs into the frame. The glowing effect could provide added visibility and safety for nighttime activities like biking or walking.",
    "3D Printed Sunglasses: Develop a pair of sunglasses using 3D printing technology. This could allow for customized lenses that are tailored to the wearer's specific prescription and preferences, as well as unique frame designs that are optimized for comfort and style. The 3D printing process could also enable the creation of lightweight and durable frames that are more environmentally friendly than traditional manufacturing methods.",
    "Solar-Powered Sunglasses: Design a pair of sunglasses that harnesses the power of the sun to charge small electronic devices. The lenses could be embedded with solar panels, which could capture and convert sunlight into electrical energy. This could provide a convenient and sustainable way to keep smartphones, fitness trackers, or other devices charged on the go.",
    "Adaptive Sunglasses: Create a pair of sunglasses that can adapt to different lighting conditions. The lenses could be equipped with sensors that detect the amount of light present and automatically adjust their tint to provide the optimal amount of protection. This could be particularly useful for people who are sensitive to bright light, such as those with migraines or other light-sensitive conditions. The glasses could also include features like automatic brightness adjustment or even a built-in UV filter for added protection."
