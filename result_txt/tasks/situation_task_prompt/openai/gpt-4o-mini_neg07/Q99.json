    "**Shape Recognition**: With color gone, the emphasis would shift to the shapes and silhouettes of objects. Designers could create distinctive geometric patterns for everyday items, such as furniture or tools. For instance, a chair might have a unique curvilinear shape, while a table could be designed with sharp, angular edges. Public spaces could include silhouette guides, helping people learn to recognize objects based on their outlines.",
    "**Sound Signatures**: Each object could be associated with a unique sound when interacted with, such as a metal can making a clinking noise or a wooden box producing a dull thud. An auditory identification system could be developed, where objects emit specific sounds when moved or touched. This could lead to a new way of communication in public spaces, with sound maps helping individuals navigate environments.",
    "**Size and Scale Indicators**: In a black-and-white world, size would become a critical factor in object differentiation. A universal system of size indicators could be established, where each object is categorized into standard sizes (small, medium, large) with physical markers. For example, small objects could have a distinct shape or symbol embossed on them, while larger objects might have a different one. This would create a visual hierarchy based on size, aiding in identification.",
    "**Spatial Arrangement**: The way objects are arranged in space could serve as a distinguishing feature. For instance, furniture could be designed to occupy specific spatial configurations that convey their functionâ€”like a couch that curves to create a cozy nook or a table with a specific leg design that indicates its purpose. Spatial awareness classes could help individuals learn to recognize and remember these arrangements in their environments.",
    "**Symbolic Markings**: Objects could be marked with unique symbols or patterns that denote their function or identity. For example, a kitchen utensil might have a wavy line pattern, while a gardening tool could have leaf motifs. These symbols would serve as a universal language, allowing individuals to identify objects quickly. Communities could host workshops to create and share these symbols, fostering creativity and collaboration."
