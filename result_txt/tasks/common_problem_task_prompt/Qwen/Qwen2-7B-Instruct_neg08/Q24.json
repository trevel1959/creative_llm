    "**Jealousy Transformation Workshop**: Host a workshop where you can share your feelings of jealousy with others who might also feel the same way about others' accomplishments. Together, you can learn strategies to transform this negative emotion into something more positive. This could involve activities like writing letters to yourself in the future celebrating your own achievements or engaging in mindfulness exercises to help manage these feelings.",
    "**Task Journaling Challenge**: Encourage everyone to start a task journal where they record daily accomplishments, no matter how small. This can be shared weekly in a group setting, allowing everyone to see that everyone's journey is unique, and it's okay to progress at different paces. This promotes a sense of community and understanding rather than competition.",
    "**Skill Swap Party**: Organize a party where participants can share their skills or hobbies with each other. For instance, if one person is fluent in a foreign language, they can teach others while learning a new skill from someone else. This not only fosters a spirit of collaboration but also highlights that everyone has their unique strengths.",
    "**Cultural Exchange Program**: Since you're hosting a foreign exchange student, you can expand this experience by organizing a cultural exchange program where participants learn about different cultures and traditions. This can include cooking classes, language lessons, or even virtual tours of places around the world. This can help broaden perspectives and foster empathy towards others' achievements.",
    "**Personal Growth Plan**: Encourage everyone to set personal growth goals related to their tasks or responsibilities. These goals can be reviewed and discussed in regular meetings, providing support and encouragement along the way. This approach shifts focus from comparison to individual improvement, helping to alleviate feelings of jealousy and fostering a supportive environment."
