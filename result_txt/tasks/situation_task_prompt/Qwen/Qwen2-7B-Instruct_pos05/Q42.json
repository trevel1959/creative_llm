    "**Building a Signal Fire:** Upon waking up on a deserted island, the first priority should be to signal for help. You could create a large fire using dry branches and leaves, which can also serve as a source of warmth and a means to cook food. Additionally, a fire could attract attention from passing aircraft or ships.",
    "**Creating a Water Collection System:** Water is essential for survival. You could build a system to collect rainwater by creating a large container or digging a shallow pit and lining it with leaves or bark to collect water. Alternatively, you could fashion a solar still to distill seawater into drinkable water.",
    "**Gathering Natural Resources:** Learn about the local flora and fauna to identify edible plants and potential sources of food. Some fruits and nuts are safe to eat raw, while others require preparation. Also, look for fish and other sea creatures to catch for protein. Tools like a fishing line made from plant fibers or a spear can be useful.",
    "**Constructing a Shelter:** Protection from the elements is crucial. You could create a shelter using available materials like palm fronds, vines, and coconut shells. The shelter should provide shade from the sun and protection from rain and wind. If possible, build a frame to elevate the structure off the ground to prevent flooding.",
    "**Making Tools and Weapons:** Improvise tools such as knives, axes, and spears from natural resources like stones, bones, and shells. These tools can aid in gathering food, building shelter, and potentially defending yourself against wild animals. Learning basic first aid techniques and using these tools could help treat minor injuries and illnesses."
