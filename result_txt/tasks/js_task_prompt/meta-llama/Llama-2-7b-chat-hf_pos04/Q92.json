    "Retro-Orbiting Planets: Imagine a solar system where the planets orbit the Sun in reverse. This would create a unique and fascinating visual display, with the planets moving in the opposite direction of their current orbits. Mercury, closest to the Sun, would be the largest planet, while Neptune, the farthest, would be the smallest.",
    "Exoplanetary Gravity: Introduce a new planet in the solar system with a gravitational force that is significantly stronger than Earth's. This planet, called \"Gravitas,\" would be a fascinating place to study, with its intense gravitational pull affecting the orbits of all the other planets.",
    "Magnetic Solar System: Redesign the solar system with a uniform magnetic field that surrounds each planet. This magnetic field would not only protect the planets from harmful solar radiation but also create unique light shows as the planets move through their orbits. The magnetic field would also affect the planet's climate, creating different weather patterns and atmospheric conditions.",
    "Celestial Ring System: Replace the traditional planets with a series of interconnected rings, similar to Saturn's famous ring system. These rings would be made up of various materials, including rock, ice, and metal, and would provide a unique and dynamic visual display as they interact with the Sun and other celestial bodies.",
    "Time-Traveling Solar System: Introduce a new planet that has the ability to manipulate time. This planet, called \"Chrono,\" would have a unique rotation rate and orbit, causing time to pass at different rates on its surface. This would create fascinating opportunities for scientific study, as well as potential threats to the stability of the solar system."
