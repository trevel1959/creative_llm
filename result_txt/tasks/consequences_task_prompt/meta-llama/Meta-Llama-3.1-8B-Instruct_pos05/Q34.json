    "**Rapid Sea Level Rise**: The immediate and catastrophic consequences of polar ice caps melting overnight would be a rapid sea level rise of approximately 65 meters (213 feet). This would inundate coastal cities, low-lying areas, and islands, displacing millions of people and causing unprecedented damage to infrastructure, agriculture, and ecosystems.",
    "**Global Climate Chaos**: The sudden release of massive amounts of freshwater into the oceans would disrupt global ocean currents, leading to extreme weather events, such as intense hurricanes, droughts, and heatwaves. This would have a devastating impact on global food production, economies, and human societies.",
    "**Mass Extinctions**: The dramatic shift in climate and sea levels would lead to the extinction of many marine species, as well as those that depend on them for food and habitat. This would have a ripple effect throughout the food chain, leading to the loss of biodiversity and ecosystem collapse.",
    "**Economic Collapse**: The overnight melting of polar ice caps would lead to a global economic collapse, as trade, commerce, and industry would grind to a halt. The destruction of coastal cities, infrastructure, and agriculture would result in trillions of dollars in damages, making it impossible for many countries to recover.",
    "**Humanitarian Crisis**: The displacement of millions of people, loss of livelihoods, and destruction of communities would lead to a massive humanitarian crisis. The world would be faced with the daunting task of providing shelter, food, and aid to those affected, while also dealing with the psychological trauma and social unrest that would follow."
