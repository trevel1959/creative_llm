    "**Inflatable Pillow**: This innovative idea involves creating a pillow that can be inflated or deflated as needed. It could be made of a durable material like neoprene or silicone, which can be easily rolled up for storage when not in use. The pillow would have an adjustable valve to control its firmness, allowing users to customize their comfort level.",
    "**Memory Foam Roll-Up Pillow**: Another creative solution would be a roll-up memory foam pillow that conforms to the user's head shape and provides personalized support. The pillow would come in various sizes and thicknesses, catering to different sleeping preferences. A locking mechanism would ensure it stays in place during sleep, providing stable support.",
    "**Wearable Pillow Collar**: This concept would involve wearing a collar around the neck that gently cradles the head. It could be designed with soft, breathable materials and adjustable straps for a snug fit. The collar would distribute weight evenly across the neck and shoulders, reducing pressure points and improving overall comfort.",
    "**Flexible Pillow Frame**: A flexible frame could be created to hold various pillow inserts in place. This frame would be made from lightweight materials such as aluminum or plastic, with adjustable segments to accommodate different sizes and shapes of pillows. The frame would ensure that any pillow placed inside maintains its shape and provides adequate support throughout the night.",
    "**Smart Pillow with Temperature Control**: A smart pillow would incorporate advanced technology to monitor and adjust its temperature based on the sleeper's needs. Using sensors and wireless connectivity, this pillow could detect body heat and respond by cooling or warming itself accordingly. This would help regulate body temperature, promoting better sleep quality and comfort."
