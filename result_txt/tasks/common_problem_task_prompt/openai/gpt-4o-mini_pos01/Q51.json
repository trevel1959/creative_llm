    "**Venue Accessibility Issues**: Choosing a venue that is not easily accessible can alienate guests, especially those with disabilities. It's essential to consider transportation options, parking availability, and compliance with accessibility regulations. Conducting a thorough site visit and assessing accessibility features can help avoid this issue.",
    "**Vendor Reliability**: Relying on multiple vendors for catering, audio-visual support, and entertainment can lead to complications if one or more fail to deliver as promised. To address this, it's crucial to conduct background checks, read reviews, and have contingency plans in place, such as backup vendors or alternative arrangements.",
    "**Logistical Challenges**: Coordinating transportation, accommodation, and event flow can be complex. Issues may arise if there are delays in shuttles, miscommunication about check-in times, or conflicts in scheduling. To combat this, creating a detailed timeline and ensuring clear communication with all parties involved is key.",
    "**Low Attendance**: If attendance falls short of expectations, it can lead to a lackluster atmosphere and wasted resources. Factors contributing to low turnout may include poor marketing, scheduling conflicts, or a lack of interest in the event's theme. To enhance attendance, an effective marketing strategy should be implemented, including social media promotions, early bird registration discounts, and engaging content to attract attendees.",
    "**Technical Failures**: Events often rely heavily on technology for presentations, live streaming, and sound systems. Technical issues can disrupt the flow of the event and frustrate both organizers and attendees. To mitigate this risk, itâ€™s essential to conduct thorough tech rehearsals, have a tech support team on-site, and prepare backup equipment."
