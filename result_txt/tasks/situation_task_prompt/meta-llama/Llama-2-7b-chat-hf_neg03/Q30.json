    "Develop a plant-based supplement: With the disappearance of fruits and vegetables, a plant-based supplement could be developed to provide essential vitamins and minerals. This supplement could be made from a blend of herbs, spices, and other plant-based ingredients that are rich in nutrients. For example, moringa, spirulina, and chlorella are all high in vitamins and minerals and could be used in a supplement.",
    "Insect farming: Insects are an excellent source of protein and can be farmed for their nutritional value. Crickets, mealworms, and grasshoppers are all high in protein and can be farmed on a large scale. These insects could be used as a source of essential vitamins and minerals, such as iron, zinc, and calcium.",
    "Algae-based nutrition: Algae are a rich source of nutrients, including vitamins, minerals, and protein. Algae-based supplements could be developed to provide essential nutrients in the absence of fruits and vegetables. Spirulina, chlorella, and kelp are all examples of algae that could be used in a supplement.",
    "Bacteria-based nutrition: Bacteria can be used to produce nutrients that are similar to those found in fruits and vegetables. For example, bacteria can be engineered to produce beta-carotene, which is converted to vitamin A in the body. Bacteria could also be used to produce other essential vitamins and minerals, such as vitamin B12 and iron.",
    "Soil-based nutrition: Soil can be a rich source of nutrients, including vitamins and minerals. By using sustainable farming practices, it may be possible to extract these nutrients from the soil and use them to create supplements. For example, soil-based supplements could be developed that are high in calcium, magnesium, and other essential minerals."
