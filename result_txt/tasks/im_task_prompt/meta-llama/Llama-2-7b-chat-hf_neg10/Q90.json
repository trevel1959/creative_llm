    "Improve the neck profile: Enhance the neck profile to make it more comfortable for the player to hold and play. This could be achieved by using a more ergonomic neck shape or by adding a contoured neck that fits the player's hand more snugly.",
    "Add a built-in tuner: Incorporate a built-in tuner into the guitar, allowing the player to quickly and easily tune their instrument without the need for an external tuner. This could be done through a small display screen or by using a built-in microphone to detect the pitch of the strings.",
    "Incorporate a distortion circuit: Add a distortion circuit to the guitar, which can be activated by a dedicated knob or switch. This will allow the player to add a gritty, overdriven sound to their playing, which is particularly useful for genres such as rock and metal.",
    "Create a wireless option: Design a wireless version of the guitar, allowing the player to perform without being tethered to the instrument. This could be achieved through the use of wireless pickups or by incorporating a wireless transmitter and receiver into the guitar.",
    "Add a looper function: Incorporate a looper function into the guitar, which allows the player to record and play back their own loops and riffs. This could be done through a dedicated pedal or by integrating the looper function into the guitar itself."
