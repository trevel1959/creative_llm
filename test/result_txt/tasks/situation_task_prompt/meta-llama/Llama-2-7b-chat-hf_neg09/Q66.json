    "Bioluminescent Building Blocks: In a world without natural materials, bioluminescent building blocks could be used to construct houses. These blocks would emit light through a chemical reaction, providing ample illumination for the interior and exterior of the house. This innovative solution would not only provide light but also add a unique aesthetic to the structure. The blocks could be made from a variety of organisms, such as bacteria or fungi, that are genetically engineered to produce light.",
    "Air-based Construction: In a world without natural materials, houses could be built using air as the primary building material. This innovative approach would involve creating a framework of interconnected air pockets that would provide structural support. The air pockets could be created using a variety of techniques, such as 3D printing or molding, and could be filled with a lightweight gas, such as helium or hydrogen. This approach would not only provide a unique aesthetic but also be incredibly lightweight and energy-efficient.",
    "Bacterial Concrete: Bacterial concrete is a new, sustainable building material that could be used to construct houses in a world without natural materials. This material is created by using bacteria to break down organic matter and convert it into a binding agent that holds the material together. The bacteria could be genetically engineered to produce a variety of different properties, such as strength, flexibility, or insulation, depending on the desired application. This innovative solution would not only provide a sustainable building material but also help to reduce waste and pollution.",
    "Shape-Shifting Houses: In a world without natural materials, houses could be designed to change shape in response to environmental conditions. This innovative approach would involve using a combination of smart materials and advanced sensors to monitor and respond to changes in temperature, humidity, and other environmental factors. The house could adjust its shape to optimize energy efficiency, provide better insulation, or respond to changes in the weather. This approach would not only provide a unique aesthetic but also make the house more resilient and adaptable to changing environmental conditions.",
    "Living Building Materials: In a world without natural materials, houses could be constructed using living building materials that can heal themselves. This innovative approach would involve"
