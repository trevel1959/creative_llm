    "**Complete Solar Eclipse:** The Earth's rotation is responsible for the day-night cycle. If the Earth stopped rotating, there would be a continuous solar eclipse over one hemisphere, leading to extreme darkness and cold temperatures. The other hemisphere would experience unrelenting sunlight, causing unbearable heat and potential evaporation of water bodies. Confidence Score: 0.9",
    "**Altered Ocean Currents and Weather Patterns:** Earth's rotation influences ocean currents through the Coriolis effect. Without this force, ocean currents would behave differently, potentially disrupting climate patterns and leading to significant changes in weather conditions. This could result in altered rainfall distribution, affecting agriculture and biodiversity. Confidence Score: 0.8",
    "**Impact on Gravity:** Earth's rotation generates a centrifugal force that counteracts gravity slightly at the equator. If the Earth stopped rotating, this force would disappear, leading to a more uniform gravitational pull across the planet. This change could affect the weight of objects and human physiology, possibly requiring new adaptations for humans. Confidence Score: 0.7",
    "**Seismic Activity Changes:** Earth's rotation contributes to tectonic plate movement. A sudden cessation could lead to a temporary pause or alteration in these movements, potentially affecting seismic activity. This could result in shifts in fault lines, which might increase the likelihood of earthquakes. Confidence Score: 0.8",
    "**Timekeeping Disruption:** Our current timekeeping system is based on Earth's rotation, dividing the day into hours, minutes, and seconds. Without this rotation, defining a standard unit of time becomes challenging. This could lead to the development of alternative time systems or the adoption of celestial events (like the orbit of the Moon around the Earth) as a basis for time measurement. Confidence Score: 0.9"
