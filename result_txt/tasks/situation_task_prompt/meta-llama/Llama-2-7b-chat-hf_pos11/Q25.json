    "Build a makeshift elevator using pulleys and ropes: One creative solution to reach the top of a skyscraper when all elevators stop working is to construct a makeshift elevator using pulleys and ropes. This system would involve attaching a sturdy rope to the top of the building and another rope to a point near the ground level. Then, use pulleys to create a system of lift and lower the ropes, allowing people to climb up or down the building. This solution would require some technical knowledge and materials, but it could be a feasible option in a pinch.",
    "Use a zip line: Another creative solution to reach the top of a skyscraper is to set up a zip line. This would involve attaching a sturdy cable to the top of the building and another cable to a point near the ground level. Then, use a pulley system to pull the zip line taut, creating a cable that people can ride up and down the building. This solution would be faster and more exciting than a traditional elevator, and it could be a fun way to travel between floors.",
    "Create a human-powered elevator: A unique and creative solution to reach the top of a skyscraper is to build a human-powered elevator. This would involve constructing a large, vertical cylinder with a platform at the top. People could then climb into the cylinder and use their muscles to turn a crank, which would lift the platform up the building. This solution would require a lot of effort and endurance, but it could be a fun and rewarding way to reach the top of a skyscraper.",
    "Use a homemade glider: For those who are adventurous and skilled in engineering, a creative solution to reach the top of a skyscraper is to build a homemade glider. This would involve constructing a lightweight, aerodynamic frame with a platform at the top. Then, use a powerful fan or wind turbine to lift the glider off the ground and propel it up the building. This solution would require a lot of technical knowledge and resources, but it could be a thrilling and efficient way to reach the top of a skyscraper.",
