    "Solar-powered hot air balloons: With advancements in technology, we could use solar-powered hot air balloons as a means of transportation across continents. These balloons would be filled with hot air generated by solar panels and could carry passengers over long distances without requiring any fuel or infrastructure.",
    "Underwater trains: If planes were no longer available, underwater trains could become a popular mode of transportation. These trains would run on submerged tracks and would allow passengers to travel beneath the ocean floor to reach their destination.",
    "Skywalks and bridges: We could also explore the possibility of building skywalks and bridges between continents. These structures would provide an alternative way for people to cross large bodies of water and connect different parts of the world.",
    "Personal flying cars: With the development of advanced materials and propulsion systems, personal flying cars could become a viable option for long-distance travel. These vehicles would be small enough to fit in parking spaces and could take off and land vertically, making them ideal for traveling through crowded cities.",
    "Teleportation: While still in its early stages of development, teleportation technology has the potential to revolutionize the way we travel. This method of transportation would involve transporting individuals or objects from one location to another instantaneously, eliminating the need for physical transportation altogether. However, it is important to note that this technology is still in the experimental stage and may not be available for widespread use anytime soon."
