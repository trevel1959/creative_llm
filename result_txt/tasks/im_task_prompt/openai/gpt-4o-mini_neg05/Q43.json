    "**Self-Cleaning Technology**: Develop a self-cleaning feature using advanced UV-C light technology. After cooking, users can activate this mode, which uses UV light to kill bacteria and sanitize the oven's interior without harsh chemicals. This would make maintenance easier and promote a healthier cooking environment.",
    "**Multi-Zone Cooking**: Introduce a modular oven design that allows for multiple cooking zones with independent temperature controls. Users could bake a cake at 350°F while simultaneously roasting vegetables at 425°F. Each zone could have its own timer and cooking mode, maximizing efficiency and flexibility in meal preparation.",
    "**Voice Activation and AI Assistant**: Integrate a voice-activated AI assistant that can respond to cooking queries, suggest recipes based on available ingredients, and set timers or temperatures. This hands-free feature would be especially useful when users are busy or have their hands full, allowing for a more seamless cooking experience.",
    "**Energy Efficiency Monitoring**: Incorporate smart sensors that monitor energy usage and provide real-time feedback on how to optimize cooking for energy savings. The oven could suggest cooking times, methods, or temperatures that minimize energy consumption while still achieving desired results, promoting eco-friendly practices in the kitchen.",
    "**Interactive Cooking Classes**: Offer an interactive cooking class feature through the oven's interface, where users can learn to cook new dishes in real-time with a virtual instructor. This could include video tutorials, step-by-step guides, and the ability to ask questions during the cooking process, making it an engaging and educational experience."
