    "**Inverted Wheelchair**: Design an inverted wheelchair where the seat faces downwards. The person can push themselves along by moving their feet up and down, similar to how a penguin moves in water. This idea takes inspiration from aquatic animals that move against gravity. Confidence Score: 0.9",
    "**Gravity-Assisted Skateboard**: Develop a skateboard that uses the concept of 'falling' to move forward. The board is attached to a mechanism that allows it to release the rider when they jump, propelling them forward as they fall back to the ground. Confidence Score: 0.85",
    "**Climbing Rods**: Create long, flexible rods that can be gripped and pushed along walls or surfaces. These rods could have grips or spikes to help the user maintain balance and control. Confidence Score: 0.9",
    "**Tethered Parachute System**: Attach a parachute to a harness worn by the individual. By jumping and falling slowly, the person can move forward. This system would require careful management of air resistance and landing spots. Confidence Score: 0.8",
    "**Water-Jet Propulsion Suit**: Design a suit that uses water jets on the limbs to propel the wearer forward through the water. The suit would be streamlined to reduce drag, making movement more efficient. Confidence Score: 0.9"
