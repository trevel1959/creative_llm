    "**Economic Turmoil**: The economy would face a catastrophic shock as transactions, banking systems, and stock markets grind to a halt. Businesses that depend on electronic payments would be unable to operate, causing widespread closures and layoffs. The inability to access digital records would lead to chaos in inventory management, payroll processing, and customer service, pushing many companies into bankruptcy.",
    "**Transportation Chaos**: With electronic devices failing, navigation systems, traffic lights, and public transportation would be severely disrupted. Air travel would come to a standstill, as planes rely on electronic systems for communication and navigation. Ground transportation would be chaotic, with traffic jams and accidents likely due to non-functioning traffic control systems. Emergency services would also struggle to respond effectively without their communication tools.",
    "**Healthcare Crisis**: Hospitals and medical facilities would face a dire situation as electronic medical records, diagnostic machines, and life-support systems become inoperable. Healthcare professionals would revert to manual methods, which could lead to mistakes and inefficiencies. The lack of communication would hinder the coordination of emergency responses, putting patientsâ€™ lives at risk and overwhelming the already strained healthcare system.",
    "**Cultural and Social Disruption**: The sudden loss of electronic devices would lead to a cultural shift, as people would be forced to reconnect in more traditional ways. This could foster a sense of community as individuals engage in face-to-face interactions, but it could also lead to social unrest as people grapple with the loss of their digital lives. The arts and entertainment industries would suffer immensely, with live performances and community gatherings becoming the primary means of engagement.",
    "**Psychological Impact**: The abrupt disconnection from electronic devices would lead to widespread anxiety and distress. Many individuals rely on their devices for daily routines, social interactions, and even mental health support. The sudden absence could trigger feelings of isolation and fear, leading to a mental health crisis as people struggle to cope with the sudden change in their lifestyles."
