    "**Customizable Brush Heads**: Create a range of interchangeable brush heads that cater to different dental needs (sensitive gums, whitening, deep cleaning, etc.). Each brush head could have a smart chip that communicates with the toothbrush to adjust the vibration intensity and brushing modes automatically based on the selected head.",
    "**Integrated Mouthwash Dispenser**: Design an electric toothbrush that has a compartment for mouthwash, allowing users to dispense a measured amount of mouthwash directly onto the brush head during or after brushing. This would encourage better oral hygiene practices by combining brushing and rinsing in one step.",
    "**Eco-Friendly Materials**: Innovate the electric toothbrush using sustainable materials, such as biodegradable plastics or bamboo for the handle. Additionally, the brush heads could be designed for easy recycling, promoting a greener lifestyle and reducing plastic waste associated with traditional toothbrushes.",
    "**Interactive Brushing Timer**: Incorporate an interactive timer that plays fun music or sounds during brushing, encouraging children (and adults) to brush for the recommended two minutes. The timer could change tunes or sounds based on the remaining time, making the experience more enjoyable and less of a chore.",
    "**Travel-Friendly Design**: Create a compact electric toothbrush with a built-in UV sterilizer that can clean the brush head while stored in a travel case. This would not only ensure hygiene on the go but also save space and provide convenience for frequent travelers who want to maintain their oral care routine."
