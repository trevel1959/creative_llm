    "Reversal of Aging: One potential consequence of limb regeneration like starfish is the reversal of aging. As humans age, our bodies gradually lose their ability to regenerate tissues and organs, leading to a decline in overall health. With the ability to regenerate limbs, humans could potentially regain some of that lost functionality, slowing down the aging process and improving overall health.",
    "Enhanced Safety: Another possible consequence of limb regeneration is enhanced safety in dangerous or hazardous environments. Imagine being able to regrow a lost limb after an accident or injury, or even regenerate a new limb entirely in response to a traumatic event. This could revolutionize the way we approach search and rescue missions, as well as military operations.",
    "Limb Loss Reversal: With the ability to regenerate limbs like starfish, people who have suffered from limb loss could potentially regain their lost limbs. This could have a profound impact on individuals and society as a whole, allowing people to live more normal lives and reducing the psychological and emotional toll of limb loss.",
    "New Forms of Prosthetics: The ability to regenerate limbs could also lead to new forms of prosthetics that are more advanced and effective. By studying how starfish regenerate their limbs, scientists could develop prosthetics that can be grown or regenerated in response to injury or wear and tear, providing a more natural and seamless experience for users.",
    "Limb Augmentation: Finally, the ability to regenerate limbs like starfish could also lead to new forms of limb augmentation. Imagine being able to grow additional limbs to enhance strength, dexterity, or even cognitive abilities. This could open up new possibilities for people with disabilities, as well as those seeking to enhance their physical and mental abilities."
