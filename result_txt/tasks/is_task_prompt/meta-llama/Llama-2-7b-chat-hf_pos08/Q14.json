    "A musical garden: Create a garden filled with flowers that sing when they are touched or exposed to music. Visitors can walk through the garden and listen to the flowers sing, creating a magical and unique experience. The flowers could be genetically engineered to produce different notes and melodies depending on the type of music played, adding an interactive element to the garden.",
    "Flower-powered instruments: Design a series of instruments that are powered by the flowers themselves. For example, a guitar made from a flower petal that vibrates when played, or a flute that produces different notes depending on the type of flower used. This would create a unique and immersive musical experience, blending nature and technology.",
    "Flower-themed escape room: Create an escape room that is designed to look and feel like a flower garden. Visitors must solve puzzles and challenges to escape the room, with clues and hints hidden among the flowers. The room could be designed to change with the seasons, with different flowers and challenges each time.",
    "Flower-based art installation: Create a large-scale art installation that uses flowers as the primary medium. The installation could take the form of a mosaic made from thousands of flowers, or a series of sculptures that use flowers to create a narrative or message. The installation could be interactive, with visitors able to manipulate the flowers to create different patterns and designs.",
    "Flower-powered virtual reality experience: Develop a virtual reality experience that immerses users in a world made entirely of flowers. Users can explore a virtual garden, interact with virtual flowers, and even create their own custom flower arrangements. The experience could be designed to promote relaxation and stress relief, using the calming and meditative qualities of flowers to help users unwind."
