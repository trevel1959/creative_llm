    "Impact on the Economy: Due to their role as pollinators, insects are crucial for maintaining agricultural productivity. For example, bees are vital for the pollination of commercial crops, such as fruit and vegetable production. The loss of insect pollination would result in lower yields and increased production costs for farmers, ultimately impacting the economy.",
    "Decreased Biodiversity: Insects make up about two-thirds of the animal kingdom and contribute greatly to biodiversity. Their loss could lead to a decline in ecosystem health and a reduction in genetic diversity.",
    "Indicator Species: Many insects (such as canaries and bees) act as 'indicator species,' meaning their populations can serve as an early warning system for imbalances in the ecosystem. Their decline could signal problems that may eventually affect larger species and the overall health of the environment.",
    "Pest Control Concerns: Insects usually serve as a natural control for other pests that could become overpopulated without them. With the removal of insect predators, other pests could flourish, potentially causing widespread damage to the environment and leading to new infestations.",
    "Nutrient Cycling: Insects help to distribute nutrients within the ecosystem by feeding on plants, consuming and breaking down organic matter, and serving as a food source for various animals. The loss of insects could disrupt nutrient cycling and affect overall soil fertility."
