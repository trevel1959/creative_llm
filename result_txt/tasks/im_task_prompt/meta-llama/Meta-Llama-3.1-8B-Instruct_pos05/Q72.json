    "Surfboard with a built-in water filtration system: The surfboard would have a small, waterproof compartment that houses a water filtration system. This system would use a combination of ceramic filters and UV light to remove impurities and bacteria from the water, making it safe for drinking. The compartment would be designed to be easily accessible and refillable, allowing the surfer to stay hydrated during long sessions in the water. This feature would be particularly useful for surfers who spend extended periods in the water, such as during competitions or long-distance paddling events.",
    "Surfboard with a built-in GPS and tracking system: This surfboard would be equipped with a GPS device that tracks the surfer's location, speed, and distance traveled. The device would also have a built-in accelerometer that measures the surfer's movements, allowing for detailed analysis of their technique and performance. This data could be transmitted to a smartphone or computer, allowing the surfer to review their performance and identify areas for improvement. The GPS system would also enable the surfer to mark and save their favorite surf spots, making it easier to find and return to them.",
    "Surfboard with a built-in solar panel: This surfboard would have a small, waterproof solar panel integrated into the deck. The solar panel would charge a rechargeable battery, which would power a variety of features such as a waterproof speaker, a USB port for charging devices, or a small LED light for night surfing. The solar panel would also be designed to be removable, allowing the surfer to use it as a portable power source for other devices.",
    "Surfboard with a built-in, detachable fin system: This surfboard would have a unique fin system that allows the surfer to easily detach and reattach the fins on the fly. This would be particularly useful for surfers who need to adjust their fin configuration quickly, such as during a competition or when switching between different surf spots. The fin system would be designed to be easy to use and require minimal tools, making it a convenient and time-saving feature for surfers.",
    "Surfboard with a built-in, temperature-controlled storage compartment: This surfboard would have a small, insulated compartment that can store small items such as snacks, water, or a first-aid kit. The compartment would be designed to maintain a consistent temperature, keeping items cool or warm as needed. This feature would be particularly useful for surfers who spend extended periods in the water, as it would allow them to store and transport their gear more efficiently and effectively."
