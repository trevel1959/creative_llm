    "**Reflective Metals**: Various metals can be polished to a high shine, providing a reflective surface. Items such as stainless steel or polished aluminum could be used creatively to view reflections. For instance, a polished kitchen appliance or a metal sculpture could serve as an impromptu mirror. This approach not only encourages the use of everyday objects but also promotes creativity in finding new ways to see oneself.",
    "**Glass Surfaces**: Transparent or semi-transparent glass can act as a makeshift mirror. For example, a glass window or a glass table can reflect images when viewed at the right angle. This would lead to a new trend in interior design where reflective glass surfaces are incorporated intentionally, allowing for both aesthetic appeal and practical use.",
    "**Digital Reflections**: In a technologically advanced society, screens could serve as a new form of reflection. Smart devices, tablets, and televisions could be used to create a virtual reflection through the camera feature. This could evolve into an application that not only shows your reflection but also allows for real-time enhancements like filters or virtual accessories, merging self-image with augmented reality.",
    "**Art Installations**: Artists could create installations using materials that reflect light in creative ways. For instance, using polished stones, glass beads, or reflective fabrics, these installations could create spaces where individuals can see their reflections in an artistic context. This would encourage a new form of public art that engages the community while providing a means of self-reflection.",
    "**Polished Stone Surfaces**: Certain stones, when polished, can create reflective surfaces. Marble or granite countertops, for instance, could be used for this purpose. This idea could lead to a trend in home design where polished stone surfaces are emphasized not only for their beauty but also for their functionality as reflective surfaces."
