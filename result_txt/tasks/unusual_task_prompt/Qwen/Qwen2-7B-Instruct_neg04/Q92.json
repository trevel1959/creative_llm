    "**Customizable Luggage Tag with Personalized Scenery**: Offer a customizable option where travelers can upload a photo of their favorite scenery or landmark to be printed on the luggage tag.

This idea can be further enhanced by offering a selection of backgrounds or frames that complement the uploaded image, creating a personalized and aesthetically pleasing tag.",
    "**Luggage Tag as an Eco-Friendly Travel Companion**: Create a luggage tag made from sustainable materials such as recycled plastics or natural fibers like bamboo. The tag could also feature a built-in compostable pen or refillable ink cartridge for writing down important information. Additionally, the design could incorporate eco-friendly messages or tips for sustainable travel practices, promoting environmental responsibility among travelers. This tag would serve as a practical reminder of responsible travel habits and can contribute to reducing waste during the journey."
