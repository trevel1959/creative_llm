[
    "Structural integrity: The spaceship must be designed to withstand the extreme conditions of space travel, such as radiation, microgravity, and temperature fluctuations. If the ship's structure is not strong enough, it may break apart during flight, putting the crew at risk.",
    "Navigation and communication: The spaceship must be equipped with advanced navigation and communication systems to ensure that it can navigate through space and communicate with ground control. If these systems fail, the crew may become lost or unable to communicate with Earth, putting their lives at risk.",
    "Life support systems: The spaceship must have a reliable life support system to provide the crew with breathable air, water, and food. If the life support systems fail, the crew may not be able to survive the journey.",
    "Crew health and safety: The spaceship must be designed to protect the crew from the hazards of space travel, such as radiation and microgravity. If the ship is not designed to address these issues, the crew's health and safety may be compromised.",
    "Re-entry and landing: The spaceship must be designed to safely re-enter the Earth's atmosphere and land on solid ground. If the ship is not designed to handle the intense heat and stress of re-entry, it may break apart during the landing process, putting the crew at risk."
