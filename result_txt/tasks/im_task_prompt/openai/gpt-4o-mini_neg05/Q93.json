    "**Customizable Weight Inserts**: Design a bowling ball with adjustable weight inserts that can be easily swapped out. This allows bowlers to fine-tune the ball's weight according to their preferences or physical condition on any given day. This feature would be particularly beneficial for players recovering from injuries or those who want to transition between different styles of play.",
    "**Ergonomic Grip Technology**: Develop a bowling ball with an innovative grip design that conforms to the user’s hand shape. Using 3D printing technology, the grip can be customized for each bowler, enhancing comfort and control. This could also include a textured surface for better handling, reducing the chance of the ball slipping during release.",
    "**Integrated LED Lights**: Incorporate LED lights within the bowling ball that activate upon impact with the pins. These lights could change color based on the type of strike (e.g., a spare versus a strike) or create a light show during bowling nights, adding a fun and engaging visual element to the game. This feature would be particularly appealing for family-friendly bowling alleys and parties.",
    "**Bowling Ball with Built-in Coaching**: Create a bowling ball equipped with an AI-driven coaching system. The ball would provide audio feedback through a small speaker embedded in the ball, offering tips on stance, approach, and release timing based on the bowler's performance. This would help beginners learn the sport more effectively and encourage seasoned players to refine their skills.",
    "**Temperature Regulation System**: Design a bowling ball with a built-in temperature regulation system that keeps the ball at an optimal temperature for performance. This feature could help maintain the ball’s grip and reaction on the lane, especially in extreme weather conditions. The system could use a rechargeable battery to power a small heating or cooling element inside the ball."
