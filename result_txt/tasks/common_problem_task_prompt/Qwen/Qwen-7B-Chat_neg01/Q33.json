    "\"Island Explorer\" - Create a virtual reality game where players are stranded on a deserted island and must explore their surroundings to find food, water, shelter, and other resources to survive. The game could include puzzles, challenges, and obstacles that players must overcome in order to progress.",
    "\"Island Building Challenge\" - In this idea, participants would be given a limited set of materials and tools, such as wood, stone, and rope, and challenged to build a shelter, a fishing rod, or a fire using only those resources. Participants could work alone or in teams to see who can create the most functional and innovative structures.",
    "\"Island Cooking Competition\" - Participants would be given a set of ingredients found on the island, such as fruits, fish, and plants, and challenged to create a delicious meal using only those resources. Judges could taste and rate the dishes based on flavor, creativity, and presentation.",
    "\"Island Survival Storytelling\" - In this idea, participants would be given a prompt, such as \"What happened when you first arrived on the island?\" or \"How did you learn to catch fish?\" and asked to write a short story about their experience. Participants could share their stories with each other and discuss what they learned from their experiences.",
    "\"Island Photography Contest\" - Participants would be encouraged to take photos of their surroundings, including the landscape, wildlife, and any other interesting sights they encounter.
