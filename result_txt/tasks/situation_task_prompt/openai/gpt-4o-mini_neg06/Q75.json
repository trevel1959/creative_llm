    "**Hydrogen Fuel Cells**: With the disappearance of oil, hydrogen could emerge as a primary fuel source. Vehicles could be designed to run on hydrogen fuel cells, which convert hydrogen gas into electricity, powering electric motors. Hydrogen can be produced through electrolysis using renewable energy sources like wind or solar power, making it a sustainable option. A global network of hydrogen production facilities and refueling stations could facilitate long-distance travel, similar to current gas stations.",
    "**Biofuel Production from Waste**: Vehicles could be powered by biofuels derived from organic waste materials, such as agricultural residues, food waste, and even municipal solid waste. Advanced fermentation and conversion technologies could transform these materials into biodiesel or bioethanol. This not only provides a renewable fuel source but also addresses waste management issues, turning garbage into valuable energy.",
    "**Electric Vehicles with Advanced Battery Technology**: The focus could shift to developing high-capacity, fast-charging batteries that allow electric vehicles to travel longer distances without the need for extensive charging infrastructure. Innovations like solid-state batteries or lithium-sulfur batteries could offer significantly improved energy density, reducing the weight and size of batteries while increasing range. Additionally, vehicles could feature regenerative braking systems to harness energy during deceleration.",
    "**Magnetic Levitation and Rail Systems**: A new era of transportation could arise through the expansion of magnetic levitation (maglev) systems for both passenger and cargo vehicles. Maglev trains and pods could operate on dedicated tracks, using magnetic forces to glide above the ground, drastically reducing friction and energy consumption. This mode of transport could complement existing road networks, allowing for rapid transit without reliance on fossil fuels.",
    "**Compressed Air Vehicles**: Vehicles powered by compressed air could revolutionize personal and public transport. These vehicles would utilize a system of compressed air tanks to drive pistons that power the wheels. The technology could be further enhanced with regenerative systems that capture energy from braking to recharge the air tanks. Compressed air stations could be established in urban areas, making it easy to refuel."
