Bury the tennis ball in a designated spot, to be opened in a year or more, serving as a reminder of the progress made and the growth experienced.",
    "**Racket-Wielding Robot**: Design a robot that uses a tennis racket to play a game of tennis against a human opponent.

    "**Tennis Ball Maze**: Construct a life-size maze using tennis balls as the primary material. The maze would be designed to test problem-solving skills, spatial awareness, and perseverance. Participants would navigate through the maze, using tennis balls as obstacles and tools to overcome challenges.",
    "**Serve-It-Forward**: Launch a community service initiative where tennis players and enthusiasts come together to serve food, toys, or other essential items to those in need. The twist? Each participant would use a tennis ball as a \"currency\" to \"buy\" the items they want to serve. For every tennis ball collected, a corresponding item would be donated to the community.",
    "**Ace of Resilience**: Develop a board game or card game that teaches players about the importance of resilience and perseverance in the face of challenges.
