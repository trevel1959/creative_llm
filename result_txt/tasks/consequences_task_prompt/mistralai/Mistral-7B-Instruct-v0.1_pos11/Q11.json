    "Increased Tides: If the Earth had two moons instead of one, the gravitational pull would be stronger, leading to higher tides in coastal areas. This could cause flooding and erosion, leading to significant damage to infrastructure and ecosystems.",
    "Unpredictable Weather: The gravitational pull of two moons could cause unpredictable weather patterns, such as more frequent and severe storms, including hurricanes and tornadoes.",
    "Changes in Axial Tilt: The gravitational pull of two moons could cause changes in the Earth's axial tilt, which could lead to significant climate changes.",
    "Increased Lunar Eclipses: If the Earth had two moons, there would be more opportunities for lunar eclipses, which could be a fascinating spectacle for people around the world.",
    "Impact on Satellite Communications: The gravitational pull of two moons could interfere with satellite communications, leading to disruptions in communication systems and potentially impacting critical infrastructure, such as emergency response systems."
