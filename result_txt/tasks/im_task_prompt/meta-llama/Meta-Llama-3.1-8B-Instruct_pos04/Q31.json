    "**Augmented Reality Treasure Hunt**: Create an immersive experience where participants use a custom-built AR app to explore a real-world location. The app reveals hidden clues, puzzles, and challenges that lead to a final treasure. Each clue is tied to a specific location, requiring participants to physically move around the area to progress. The twist: each participant has a unique AR perspective, reflecting their individual personality and interests, influencing the clues and challenges they encounter.",
    "**Soundscaping for Emotions**: Develop an AI-powered sound system that generates an immersive audio environment tailored to a person's emotional state. Using machine learning algorithms, the system analyzes a user's brain activity, heart rate, and other physiological responses to create a personalized soundscape. This could include calming nature sounds, energizing electronic beats, or even music that adapts to a user's mood. The goal is to create a therapeutic experience that helps individuals manage their emotions and find balance.",
    "**Bioluminescent Art Gallery**: Design an interactive light installation that responds to visitors' movements, emotions, and thoughts. Using bioluminescent organisms, LED lights, and AI-powered sensors, the gallery creates a dynamic, immersive environment that adapts to each visitor's presence. The lights change color, pattern, and intensity based on the visitor's emotional state, creating a unique experience for each person.",
    "**Neurofeedback-Driven Music**: Develop a system that uses neurofeedback to generate music in real-time, responding to a person's brain activity. EEG sensors track the user's brain waves, and an AI algorithm translates these signals into sound patterns, creating a personalized musical composition. This could lead to new forms of music therapy, allowing individuals to express themselves through sound and explore their cognitive processes.",
    "**Scent-Based Memory Retrieval**: Create an immersive experience that uses scent to evoke memories and emotions. A custom-built scent-emitting system releases specific fragrances in response to a user's brain activity, heart rate, and other physiological responses. The goal is to recreate memories and emotions through scent, allowing users to relive and process their experiences in a unique and powerful way."
