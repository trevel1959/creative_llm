    "**Smart Whisk**: Integrate a built-in scale and measuring system into the whisk handle. This feature would enable users to accurately measure ingredients while whisking, eliminating the need for separate measuring cups or spoons. The whisk could also come equipped with a Bluetooth or Wi-Fi connection, allowing users to track their recipes and cooking progress remotely.",
    "**Ergonomic Whisk**: Redesign the whisk handle to provide a comfortable grip and reduce fatigue during extended use. This could involve adding a contoured shape, soft-touch materials, or even a built-in wrist rest. The ergonomic design would make the whisk more accessible to users with arthritis or other hand mobility issues.",
    "**Whisk with Built-in Timer**: Incorporate a built-in timer into the whisk handle, allowing users to set a specific whisking time or interval. This feature would be particularly useful for recipes that require precise whisking times, such as meringues or mayonnaise. The timer could also be set to alert the user when the whisking process is complete.",
    "**Whisk with Heat-Resistant Materials**: Design a whisk with heat-resistant materials, such as silicone or ceramic, that can withstand high temperatures without degrading or melting. This feature would enable users to whisk hot mixtures or sauces without worrying about damaging the whisk.",
    "**Whisk with Built-in Storage**: Create a whisk with a built-in storage compartment for small ingredients, such as spices, herbs, or zest. This feature would save users space in their kitchen and make it easier to access the ingredients they need while cooking."
