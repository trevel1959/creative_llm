    "**Self-Cleaning Mechanism**: Design an electric kettle with a self-cleaning function that utilizes ultrasonic waves or a special cleaning solution to break down mineral deposits and bacteria inside the kettle. Users could activate this feature with a button, ensuring the kettle remains hygienic and prolonging its lifespan.",
    "**Eco-Friendly Insulation**: Introduce an eco-friendly thermal insulation material that maintains the temperature of the water longer without using additional energy. This could be made from recycled materials or bio-based substances, reducing the kettle's carbon footprint and energy consumption.",
    "**Multi-Functional Base**: Create a base for the kettle that includes additional functionalities such as a wireless charging pad for smartphones, a built-in Bluetooth speaker, or even a small compartment for storing tea bags or coffee pods. This would enhance the user experience by consolidating multiple functions in one area.",
    "**Interactive Display**: Integrate an interactive touch display that not only shows the current temperature and time but also provides recipes for different beverages, brewing tips, and even a guided tutorial for novice users. This could make the kettle not just a tool, but an engaging kitchen companion.",
    "**Portable and Rechargeable Design**: Develop a portable electric kettle that can be charged via USB and used wirelessly, making it perfect for travel, camping, or outdoor activities. It could feature a compact design with a foldable handle and a built-in battery that allows users to boil water without needing a power outlet."
