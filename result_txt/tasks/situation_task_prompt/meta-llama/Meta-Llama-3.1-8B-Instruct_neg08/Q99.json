    "**Illuminated Signatures**: Each object would have a unique, intricate pattern of raised lines or textures that serve as a tactile identifier. For instance, a chair would have a series of small bumps in a specific sequence, while a book would have a series of tiny ridges. This way, individuals could run their fingers over the object to identify it by touch.",
    "**Resonance Labels**: Every object would emit a distinct, inaudible frequency when tapped or vibrated. Using a specialized device, people could detect these frequencies and identify the object. This method would be particularly useful for people with visual impairments.",
    "**Olfactory Markers**: Each object would have a unique scent associated with it, allowing individuals to identify objects through smell. This could be achieved by incorporating specific fragrances or essential oils into the object's material or coating.",
    "**Thermal Signatures**: Objects would have distinct thermal properties, such as heat conductivity or emission, that could be detected using specialized sensors. This method would be particularly useful for identifying objects in low-light environments.",
    "**Electromagnetic Signatures**: Each object would have a unique electromagnetic signature, which could be detected using specialized devices. This method would allow individuals to identify objects based on their unique electromagnetic properties, such as their electrical conductivity or magnetic permeability."
