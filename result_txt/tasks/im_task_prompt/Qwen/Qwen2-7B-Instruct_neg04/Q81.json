    "**Innovative Cooking Utensil**: Design a spatula that incorporates a built-in thermometer for cooking precise temperatures. The handle would have a digital display that shows the temperature of the food being cooked. This would be especially useful for dishes like eggs, pancakes, and meats where temperature control is critical.",
    "**Self-Cleaning Spatula**: Develop a spatula with an integrated ultrasonic cleaner. When not in use, it can be placed in a slot that vibrates at high frequencies to clean the spatula, saving time and water from traditional washing.",
    "**Flexible Spatula for Baking**: Create a spatula with a flexible, silicone tip that can conform to the shape of various baking dishes, including cake pans and cookie sheets. This would help in easily spreading batter or frosting without leaving any gaps or spaces.",
    "**Spatula-Blender Hybrid**: Combine a spatula with a small, handheld blender attachment. This would allow users to blend ingredients directly on the countertop without needing to transfer them to a blender jar first, reducing mess and saving time.",
    "**Telescopic Spatula**: Design a spatula that can extend and retract. The handle could have a mechanism allowing it to expand to reach higher areas on the stove or oven without needing to stretch. It could also collapse for easier storage."
