    "**Self-Cleaning Mechanism**: Develop a self-cleaning feature that uses steam and specialized cleaning agents to maintain the interior of the washing machine. This system would run a cycle automatically every few months, eliminating the buildup of detergent residue, mold, and odors. Users could be notified through an app when the cleaning cycle is complete, ensuring the machine remains hygienic without manual effort.",
    "**Eco-Friendly Detergent Dispenser**: Design a built-in compartment that dispenses eco-friendly, concentrated detergent pods. The machine would automatically mix the right amount of detergent based on the load size and type, reducing waste and encouraging users to opt for environmentally friendly cleaning products. This feature could also include a refillable option for bulk detergent, minimizing plastic waste.",
    "**Customizable Wash Cycles**: Introduce a feature that allows users to create and save their own wash cycles based on specific needs, such as a \"delicate wash\" for certain fabrics or a \"quick refresh\" cycle for lightly soiled clothes. This would provide a more personalized laundry experience, allowing users to tailor their washing machine to their lifestyle and preferences.",
    "**Integrated Folding Assistant**: Imagine a washing machine that is paired with a robotic folding assistant. Once the washing cycle is complete, the clothes could be automatically transferred to a folding unit that neatly organizes and folds the laundry. This system could use AI to recognize different clothing types and apply the appropriate folding techniques, saving users time and effort.",
    "**Odor Neutralizing Technology**: Implement a feature that utilizes UV light and ozone to neutralize odors during the wash cycle. This technology would target bacteria and fungi that cause unpleasant smells, ensuring that clothes come out fresh and clean. Additionally, users could select a \"refresh\" cycle that focuses solely on odor elimination for clothes that haven't been worn but need a quick refresh."
