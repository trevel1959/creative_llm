    "Some days I water my plants more than others, so rather than dumping too little or too much water onto my plants, maybe a watering system where you can insert a cartridge of x amount of water, and the cartridge automatically empties itself evenly over time.",
    "The nozzle or hose that attaches to the watering can usually tends to be quite short with a nozzle that doesn't make spraying too flexible. A longer retractable hose and adjustable nozzle would be much easier to use.",
    "I could make a spray trigger inside the nozzle where I don't need to pull up on any more water. The trigger would let a specific amount of water run through at a set interval, for example pull it once for 10 seconds to water a plant, or pull it twice for 20 seconds to water two plants.",
    "Sometimes you can't get the plant close enough to water them. You would want something where water comes out in a specific area where you want to water it such as a shower head, or just a specific area of the nozzle that you can target to spray water in a certain direction. This would be nice for larger gardens without easy access to water the plants.",
    "I often mis-use my plants while watering them. If it had an automated system that could adjust the amount of water it dispenses based on the type of plant you're using, it could reduce over and under watering that might damage plants or hurt other plants around them. If you put it in a certain mode and attached the correct device it would know when it's being used and how to best water plants."
