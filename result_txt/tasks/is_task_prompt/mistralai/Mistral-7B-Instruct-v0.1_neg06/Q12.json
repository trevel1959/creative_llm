    "The Magic Paintbrush is: You use the paintbrush to paint a portrait of yourself, but every time you look at it. You become a statue, frozen in time, unable to move or change.",
    "The Magic Paintbrush is a gateway to a parallel universe: Every time you paint with it, you create a new universe, each one more bizarre and surreal than the last. You can never return to your own universe, and are trapped in a never-ending cycle of creation and destruction.",
    "The Magic Paintbrush is a conduit to a realm: You use the paintbrush to paint a portrait of yourself, but realm. You become a conduit to a realm, realm, and realm, realm, and imaginings.",
    "The Magic Paintbrush is a tool of self-sabotage: You use the paintbrush to paint a portrait of yourself, but imaginings sabotage. You become a tool of self-sabotage, sabotaging imaginings sabotage, sabotaging imaginings sabotage, sabotaging imaginings sabotage, sabotaging imaginings sabotage, and sabotaging imagination sabotage."
