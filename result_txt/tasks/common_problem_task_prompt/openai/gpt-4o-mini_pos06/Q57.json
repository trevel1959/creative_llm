Problems can arise from unreliable suppliers, delays in shipping, or inventory mismanagement. To address this, establish strong relationships with multiple suppliers and implement an inventory management system that tracks stock levels in real-time. Consider using dropshipping or print-on-demand services to minimize inventory risks.",

Utilize analytics tools to measure the effectiveness of campaigns and adjust strategies accordingly.",
