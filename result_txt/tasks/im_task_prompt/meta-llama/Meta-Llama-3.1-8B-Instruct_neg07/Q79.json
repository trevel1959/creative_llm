    "**Hanger of the Future**: Design a smart clothes hanger that incorporates AI-powered sensors to detect the type of garment hung on it. Based on the garment's material, the hanger would adjust its grip to prevent wrinkles and creases, ensuring the item is stored in its optimal condition. The hanger could also detect when a garment is being taken off and adjust its grip accordingly, reducing the likelihood of creases.",
    "**Eco-Friendly Hanger**: Develop a clothes hanger made from a biodegradable material, such as mushroom-based mycelium or a plant-based plastic alternative. This hanger would not only reduce waste but also provide a sustainable solution for garment storage. The hanger could also be designed with a built-in recycling system, allowing users to compost or recycle the hanger when it reaches the end of its life cycle.",
    "**Hanger for the Visually Impaired**: Create a clothes hanger with raised tactile markers and Braille labels to assist visually impaired individuals in identifying different garments. The hanger could also incorporate a built-in audio system that provides a verbal description of the garment, allowing users to easily identify their clothes.",
    "**Smart Hanger with Built-in Lighting**: Design a clothes hanger with integrated LED lights that provide a soft, gentle glow. This feature would not only enhance the ambiance of a bedroom or closet but also help users locate their garments in the dark. The hanger could also be programmed to change colors or patterns based on the time of day or the occasion, creating a unique and personalized experience.",
    "**Collapsible Hanger for Small Spaces**: Develop a collapsible clothes hanger that can be easily stored in a compact space, making it ideal for small apartments, dorm rooms, or travel. The hanger could be designed with a spring-loaded mechanism that allows it to expand and contract, providing ample storage space when needed. This feature would be particularly useful for individuals who live in areas with limited closet space."
