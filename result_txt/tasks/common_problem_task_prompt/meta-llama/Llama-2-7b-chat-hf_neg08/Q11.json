    "Insufficient Funding: Another issue that may arise is insufficient funding. The event may require a significant amount of money to cover expenses such as venue rental, catering, and marketing. If the budget is not enough, it may be difficult to provide the necessary resources for a successful event.",
    "Conflicting Goals: Organizers may also face conflicting goals from different stakeholders, such as the charity organization, sponsors, and attendees. These conflicting goals can lead to disagreements and delays in decision-making, potentially jeopardizing the success of the event.",
    "Logistical Challenges: Organizing a charity event requires coordinating multiple logistical elements, such as transportation, parking, and accessibility. If these elements are not properly planned, it can cause frustration and delays for attendees, which can negatively impact the event's success.",
    "Competition: With so many charity events happening throughout the year, there may be competition for attendees' attention and donations. Organizers must find creative ways to differentiate their event and stand out from the crowd to attract attendees and generate donations.",
    "Media Attention: Another potential problem is the difficulty in securing media attention for the event. Without adequate promotion, it may be challenging to attract attendees and generate buzz around the event, which can negatively impact the event's success."
