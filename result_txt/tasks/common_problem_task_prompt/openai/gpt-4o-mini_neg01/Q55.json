    "**Funding and Resource Allocation**: Securing funding for the park can be a significant challenge. Potential problems include insufficient initial funding, lack of ongoing financial support, or misallocation of resources. To address this, a multi-faceted funding strategy could be developed, including grants, crowdfunding campaigns, partnerships with local businesses, and community fundraising events, ensuring a steady stream of financial resources.",
    "**Community Engagement and Support**: Engaging the local community is crucial for the park's success, but there may be resistance or apathy towards the project. Potential issues include conflicting interests (e.g., land use for agriculture or development) and a lack of awareness about the park's benefits. To mitigate this, organizing community workshops, educational programs, and volunteer opportunities can foster a sense of ownership and promote the parkâ€™s value for both the environment and the community.",
    "**Invasive Species Management**: The introduction of invasive species can disrupt the ecosystem balance within the conservation park. These species may outcompete native flora and fauna, leading to biodiversity loss. A proactive approach could involve implementing an invasive species management plan that includes regular monitoring, removal efforts, and public education on the importance of protecting native species.",
    "**Visitor Impact and Infrastructure**: While attracting visitors can help raise awareness and generate funds, it can also lead to environmental degradation if not managed properly. Potential problems include littering, trampling of sensitive habitats, and wildlife disturbances. Solutions could involve establishing designated trails, creating educational signage about Leave No Trace principles, and limiting visitor numbers during peak seasons to minimize impact.",
    "**Legal and Regulatory Challenges**: Establishing a nature conservation park may involve navigating complex legal and regulatory frameworks, including land ownership disputes, zoning laws, and environmental regulations. Potential problems could arise from opposition from landowners or bureaucratic hurdles. To address this, forming a legal advisory committee to guide the process and ensure compliance with all regulations can help mitigate these challenges."
