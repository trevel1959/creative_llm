    "**Modular Lens System**:    Design a modular lens system that allows users to easily swap out components of the lens. For example, users could replace the aperture blades, filters, or even add telephoto or wide-angle attachments without needing to buy an entirely new lens. This flexibility would cater to different photography styles and preferences, making it easier for photographers to adapt to various shooting conditions.",
    "**Augmented Reality (AR) Viewfinder**:    Incorporate an AR viewfinder that overlays helpful information onto the live view, such as grid lines for composition, suggested exposure settings, and even virtual subjects for focus practice. This feature could help photographers visualize their shots better and make more informed decisions on framing and exposure before capturing the image.",
    "**Eco-Friendly Solar Charging**:    Equip cameras with solar panels integrated into the body, allowing users to charge the battery using sunlight. This sustainable feature would be particularly beneficial for outdoor photographers or travelers, reducing reliance on traditional charging methods and promoting eco-friendly practices.",
    "**Smart Remote Control via Smartphone App**:    Develop a smartphone app that connects to the camera via Bluetooth or Wi-Fi, allowing users to control various camera functions remotely. The app could include features like live view, shutter release, and even advanced settings adjustments. Additionally, users could set up time-lapse or long-exposure shots without being physically present at the camera, enhancing creative possibilities.",
    "**Built-In Image Stabilization with Gyroscopic Sensors**:    Introduce advanced image stabilization technology that uses gyroscopic sensors to detect movement and compensate for it in real-time. This would be particularly useful for handheld shooting or capturing action shots, resulting in sharper images and smoother videos without the need for bulky stabilizing equipment."
