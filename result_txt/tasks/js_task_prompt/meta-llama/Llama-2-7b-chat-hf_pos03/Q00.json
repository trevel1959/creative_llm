    "Start a flying school: I would open a flying school where people could learn how to fly and experience the thrill of soaring through the skies. I would teach students of all ages and skill levels, from beginner to advanced, and help them earn their pilot's license.",
    "Become a delivery service: I would use my flying abilities to start a delivery service, delivering packages and goods to people all over the world. I could fly over traffic and navigate through tight spaces, making delivery times faster and more efficient.",
