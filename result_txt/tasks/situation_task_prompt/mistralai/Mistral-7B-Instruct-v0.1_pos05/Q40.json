    "Solar-powered devices: One alternative to battery-powered devices is to use solar panels to generate electricity. Solar panels can be attached to the device or placed nearby to capture sunlight and convert it into energy. This would require the device to have a solar panel charging port or a built-in solar panel.",
    "Kinetic energy: Another option is to use kinetic energy to power devices. Kinetic energy can be generated of motion, such as from a bicycle or a car. This energy can be used to charge a device or power it directly.",
    "Hand-crank devices: A hand-crank device can be used to generate electricity by using a hand-crank to turn a small generator. This electricity can then be used to power the device.",
    "Fuel cell devices: Fuel cells can be used to generate electricity by using a fuel, such as hydrogen, to generate an electrical current. This can be used to power a device directly.",
    "Nuclear-powered devices: Nuclear power can be used to generate electricity, which can then be used to power a device. This option is not practical for most people, as it requires a nuclear reactor and specialized knowledge to operate."
