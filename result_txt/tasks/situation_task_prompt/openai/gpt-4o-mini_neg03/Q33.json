    "**Biological Rhythms**: Tap into the human body's natural rhythms, such as the circadian rhythm. By paying attention to when you feel sleepy or hungry, you can develop a personal schedule that aligns with your biological clock. Create routines based on these feelings—meals at certain intervals, sleep times, and activity periods that reflect your body’s natural cues.",
    "**Seasonal Events**: Establish a calendar based on seasonal changes and agricultural cycles. For example, the blooming of certain flowers can indicate spring, while the harvest of crops signals autumn. Mark significant events like solstices and equinoxes to track the passing of months and seasons, creating a communal calendar that everyone can reference.",
    "**Sound Signals**: Create a system of sound signals to mark the passing of time. For example, a bell or drum can be struck at regular intervals, such as every hour, to signify the time. Community gatherings could include a series of chimes or songs that correspond to specific times of day, creating a shared auditory experience of timekeeping.",
    "**Visual Markers**: Designate specific landmarks or visual markers that can help indicate time. For example, you could use the shadow cast by a tall object (like a tree or pole) to create a sundial effect. By measuring the length and position of the shadow throughout the day, you can estimate the time based on the sun’s position.",
    "**Event-Based Tracking**: Create a system of tracking time based on significant events or activities. For instance, you could structure your day around tasks, such as \"after breakfast\" or \"after the community meeting,\" allowing you to keep a loose sense of time without the need for precise measurements. This method would rely on communal agreements about when certain activities take place."
