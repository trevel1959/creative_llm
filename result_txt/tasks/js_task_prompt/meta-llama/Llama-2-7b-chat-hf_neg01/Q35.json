    "Woolly Mammoth - With their large size and shaggy fur, woolly mammoths would be a sight to behold in modern times. They were also herbivores, so they wouldn't pose a threat to human livestock or crops. Additionally, their large size and strength would make them useful for heavy labor tasks.",
    "Quagga - The quagga is an extinct subspecies of zebra that was once found in large numbers in South Africa. They were known for their distinctive stripes, which were limited to the front half of their body. Bringing them back to life would allow us to study their unique stripe pattern and learn more about their behavior and habitat.",
    "Passenger Pigeon - Once the most abundant bird species in North America, the passenger pigeon went extinct in 1914 due to overhunting.

    "Tasmanian Tiger - Also known as the thylacine, the Tasmanian tiger was a carnivorous marsupial that was native to Tasmania and mainland Australia. They were known for their distinctive stripes and powerful jaws. Bringing them back to life would allow us to study their unique biology and learn more about their role in their ecosystem.",
    "Moa - The moa was a group of large, flightless birds that were native to New Zealand. They were known for their size, with some species reaching heights of over 10 feet (3 meters) and weighing over 500 pounds (230 kilograms). Bringing them back to life would allow us to study their behavior and ecology, as well as learn more about the prehistoric ecosystems of New Zealand."
