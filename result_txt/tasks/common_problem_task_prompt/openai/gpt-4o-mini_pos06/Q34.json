    "**Programming Challenges**: Writing the software that controls the robot can be complex. Bugs in the code can cause unexpected behavior, leading to a malfunctioning robot. Additionally, if the programming does not account for real-world variables (like obstacles or varying terrain), the robot may struggle to operate effectively. Rigorous testing and iterative development can help mitigate these issues.",
    "**Power Supply Issues**: Robots require a reliable power source, and any interruption in power can lead to failure during operation. If the battery is not adequately sized for the robot's workload or if there are inefficiencies in power consumption, the robot may run out of power prematurely. Designing an efficient power management system and considering alternative energy sources, such as solar power, can help address this concern.",
    "**Cost Overruns**: Developing a robot can be expensive, and costs can escalate quickly due to unforeseen expenses in materials, technology, or labor. Budgeting effectively and maintaining a contingency fund for unexpected costs can help manage financial risks.",
    "**User Interface and Usability**: If the robot is designed for user interaction, creating an intuitive interface is vital. Complicated controls or unclear instructions can lead to user frustration and improper use of the robot. Engaging potential users in the design process and conducting usability testing can improve the final product's effectiveness.",
    "**Safety Concerns**: Depending on the robot's application, safety can be a significant issue. Robots that operate in environments with humans must be designed with safety features to prevent accidents. This includes emergency stop functions, physical barriers, or sensors that detect human presence. Conducting thorough risk assessments and adhering to safety standards is essential."
