    "**Shipping and Handling of Components**: Acquiring individual components from multiple vendors can lead to delayed delivery or even lost or damaged components if the buyer relies on standard shipping services. In addition, packaging may not be adequate to protect the delicate electronic components during transit.",
    "**Electrical and Electronic Safety**: Mixing incompatible or unsuitable power supplies can result in electrical hazards, such as short circuits or power surges. Additionally, incorrect orientation or improper assembly of connectors, such as power cables or HDMI/USB cables, can lead to accidents or data corruption.",
    "**Software and Driver Issues**: Installing an operating system and installing necessary drivers for various components can be complex, especially if they are not the latest versions. This could result in compatibility issues with certain software and require the user to invest time and effort in troubleshooting to resolve such problems.",
    "**Cost Management**: Building a computer from scratch can be less cost-effective than buying a complete system, especially if the buyer is inexperienced and makes errors in component selection. Factors like mismatched components and inefficiencies in assembly can lead to a higher price tag than anticipated.",
    "**Workmanship and Assembly**: Poorly designed or assembled components, such as a motherboard or cooling system, can lead to overheating, reduced performance, or even hardware failure. This could result in data loss and may require the user to replace or upgrade components in the future."
