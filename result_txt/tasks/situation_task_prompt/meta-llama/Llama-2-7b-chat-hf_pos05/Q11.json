    "Utilize Alternative Computing Devices: In the event of a global computer crash, individuals could rely on alternative computing devices such as smartphones, tablets, or even smartwatches to continue their work or studies. These devices can access the internet, run productivity apps, and provide access to cloud-based services, allowing for uninterrupted workflow.",
    "Paper-Based Solutions: A retro approach could be taken by transitioning to paper-based solutions for work and studies. This could include writing notes by hand, using paper planners, and creating physical artwork or designs. This method allows for a disconnection from technology and provides an opportunity to focus on creativity and problem-solving skills.",
    "Collaborative Brainstorming: In the absence of computers, individuals could come together to brainstorm and collaborate on projects. This could involve whiteboard sessions, group problem-solving exercises, or even outdoor activities like hiking or picnics. By removing the reliance on technology, individuals can focus on their creativity and communication skills.",
    "DIY Hardware Solutions: For those with technical expertise, building DIY hardware solutions could be an option. This could include creating custom circuits, building simple computers, or even inventing new devices. By creating these solutions, individuals can not only continue their work but also develop new technologies that could potentially solve the problem of global computer crashes.",
    "Nature-Inspired Solutions: Nature has provided us with countless solutions to everyday problems. In the event of a global computer crash, individuals could look to nature for inspiration. For example, studying the patterns of ants to develop new algorithms, observing the structure of trees to improve data storage, or even using the human brain as a computer (through brain-computer interfaces). By looking to nature, individuals can find innovative solutions to continue their work and studies."
