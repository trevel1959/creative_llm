    "**Steering Wheel Virtual Reality Experience**: Develop a VR headset that allows users to immerse themselves in a simulated driving experience. The headset would track the user's head movements and translate them into realistic steering wheel movements, providing an unparalleled sense of presence and immersion. The VR experience could include realistic graphics, physics, and sound effects, making it feel like the user is actually driving a car. This could be used for training purposes, entertainment, or even therapy for individuals with anxiety disorders related to driving.",
    "**Smart Steering Wheel with Integrated Health Monitoring**: Design a smart steering wheel that incorporates health monitoring features, such as heart rate, blood pressure, and oxygen saturation tracking. The wheel could also include a built-in electrocardiogram (ECG) and a pulse oximeter. This would allow drivers to monitor their physical and mental well-being in real-time, receiving alerts and recommendations for improvement. The data could also be synced with a mobile app, enabling drivers to track their progress and share it with healthcare professionals.",
    "**Steering Wheel with Built-in Gesture Recognition**: Develop a steering wheel with integrated gesture recognition technology, allowing drivers to control various in-car functions, such as adjusting temperature, music, or navigation, using hand gestures. This could be achieved through a combination of computer vision, machine learning, and sensor technology. The wheel could also include haptic feedback, providing a tactile response to the driver's gestures, enhancing the overall user experience.",
    "**Steering Wheel with Integrated Biometric Authentication**: Design a steering wheel with integrated biometric authentication, such as fingerprint or facial recognition, to ensure secure vehicle access and prevent unauthorized use. The biometric data could be stored locally on the vehicle's onboard computer or synced with a mobile app, providing an additional layer of security. This feature could be particularly useful for fleet vehicles, rental cars, or vehicles with multiple users.",
    "**Steering Wheel with Integrated Haptic Feedback for Safety**: Develop a steering wheel with integrated haptic feedback, providing subtle vibrations or tactile cues to alert drivers to potential hazards, such as pedestrians, animals, or other vehicles. The haptic feedback could be triggered by sensors and cameras monitoring the surroundings, providing an additional layer of safety and reducing the risk of accidents. This feature could be especially useful for autonomous vehicles or vehicles with advanced driver-assistance systems (ADAS)."
