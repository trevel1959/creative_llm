    "In the event of a complete internet outage, it would be challenging to access information. However, there are still several ways to gather information without the internet. One could use traditional sources such as books, newspapers, and radio broadcasts. Alternatively, individuals could rely on personal networks and word-of-mouth to gather information.",
    "Another option would be to use offline communication tools such as telegrams or text messages to gather information. While these methods may not be as quick or convenient as the internet, they can still provide valuable information.",
    "In some cases, individuals may be able to access information through their personal networks or by reaching out to experts in the field. For example, a historian may be able to provide information on historical events without the internet.",
    "Another option would be to rely on physical resources such as libraries, archives, and museums to gather information. These resources may not be as up-to-date as the internet, but they can still provide valuable information.",
    "Finally, individuals could use mobile devices to access information stored locally on their devices. This would require downloading information before the internet outage, but it could still provide valuable information in the absence of an internet connection."
