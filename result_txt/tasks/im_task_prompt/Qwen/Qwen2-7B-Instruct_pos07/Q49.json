    "**Smart Oral Health Tracker**: Create an electric toothbrush that integrates with a smartphone app. This device can track brushing habits, alert users when they've brushed too aggressively or missed certain areas, and suggest brushing techniques based on dental health data. The app could also provide personalized oral care routines, track fluoride levels, and even remind users to replace their brush heads.",
    "**Eco-Friendly Toothbrush**: Design an electric toothbrush powered by renewable energy sources like solar cells or kinetic energy. This innovation would reduce the environmental impact of traditional battery-powered devices. Users can charge the toothbrush by simply leaving it in sunlight during the day or by using a motion-activated charger while brushing. ",
    "**Customizable Oral Care Experience**: Develop an electric toothbrush with interchangeable heads that offer different bristle textures and materials tailored to specific oral health needs. For instance, one head might be ideal for sensitive teeth, another for gum health, and yet another for deep cleaning. Users can customize their brushes according to their changing dental needs over time.",
    "**Oral Health Education Tool**: Create an educational platform embedded into the toothbrush handle that provides interactive lessons on proper brushing techniques, dental hygiene, and oral health facts. The tool could use augmented reality to simulate brushing actions, provide instant feedback, and motivate users through gamification elements such as badges and achievements.",
    "**Dental Check-up Reminder System**: Integrate a built-in camera into the toothbrush handle that can take panoramic images of the userâ€™s mouth after brushing. These images are then analyzed by AI to check for signs of cavities, gum disease, or other issues. If abnormalities are detected, the toothbrush sends reminders to schedule a dentist appointment. This system could significantly improve early detection and treatment of oral health problems."
