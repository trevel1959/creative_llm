    "**Adjustable Weight Distribution**: Design ski poles with a mechanism that allows users to adjust the weight distribution along the pole. This could involve adding or removing weights at different points, enabling skiers to customize their poles for different conditions or personal preferences. For example, a heavier pole could provide more stability in deep powder, while a lighter pole could enhance agility on groomed runs.",
    "**Ergonomic Grip with Temperature Control**: Create ski poles with grips made from advanced materials that can change temperature based on the user's preference. This feature would allow skiers to have a warm grip on cold days or a cooler grip when skiing in warmer conditions. The grip could also have an ergonomic design that molds to the user's hand for maximum comfort and reduced fatigue.",
    "**Retractable/Expandable Poles**: Design ski poles that can be easily adjusted in length, allowing them to be used for various skiing styles (e.g., alpine, cross-country) or terrain types. The poles could have a simple locking mechanism that enables quick adjustments, making them versatile for different skiers or conditions. This would also make them more portable, as they could be collapsed for easy transport.",
    "**Built-in Avalanche Safety Features**: Integrate safety features into the ski poles, such as a built-in avalanche beacon or a collapsible shovel. This would make it easier for backcountry skiers to carry essential safety equipment without the need for additional gear. The poles could also have a reflective or bright color design to enhance visibility in poor conditions.",
    "**LED Lighting for Night Skiing**: Equip ski poles with LED lights along the shaft that can illuminate the path in low-light conditions, such as during night skiing or in foggy weather. The lights could have different brightness settings and colors to indicate various modes (e.g., steady for regular use, flashing for emergencies). This feature would enhance safety and visibility for skiers on the slopes."
