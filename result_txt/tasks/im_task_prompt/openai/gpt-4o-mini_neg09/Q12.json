    "**Modular Wallet Design**: Create a wallet that consists of interchangeable modules, allowing users to customize the layout based on their needs. For example, one module could hold cards, another could hold cash, and a third could be designed for coins or small items. Users could easily snap on or off modules depending on whether theyâ€™re going for a casual outing or a formal event, promoting versatility and personalization.",
    "**Eco-Friendly Wallet Made from Recycled Materials**: Develop a wallet made entirely from recycled materials, such as plastic bottles or repurposed textiles. This wallet could feature a sleek design and come in various colors and styles, appealing to environmentally conscious consumers. Additionally, a portion of the proceeds could be donated to environmental charities, encouraging customers to make sustainable choices.",
    "**Digital Wallet with Built-In Budgeting Tools**: Innovate a wallet that includes a digital component, where users can sync their cards and cash to an app that tracks spending and offers budgeting advice. The app could analyze spending habits, provide alerts for overspending, and even suggest savings plans. This would help users manage their finances more effectively while still enjoying the convenience of a physical wallet.",
    "**Integrated Power Bank Wallet**: Design a wallet that includes a built-in power bank for charging smartphones and other devices on the go. The wallet could have a discreet charging port and a slim battery, ensuring that it remains lightweight and functional. This would be especially useful for travelers or busy professionals who rely heavily on their devices throughout the day.",
    "**RFID-Blocking Wallet with Anti-Theft Features**: Create a wallet that not only blocks RFID signals to protect against identity theft but also includes additional anti-theft features, such as a hidden alarm that activates if the wallet is moved without the owner's consent. The wallet could also have a tether that connects to a smartphone, alerting the user if they walk too far away from it, providing peace of mind in crowded areas."
