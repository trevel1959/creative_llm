    "**Interchangeable Plates for Diverse Recipes**: Design a waffle iron with interchangeable plates that allow users to create not just traditional waffles but also pancakes, hash browns, or even grilled sandwiches. Each plate could have unique patterns or shapes, providing versatility in cooking and making it fun for users to explore different breakfast options.",
    "**Built-in Mixer and Ingredient Dispenser**: Incorporate a small mixing bowl and an automatic ingredient dispenser into the waffle iron. Users could add their wet and dry ingredients, and the machine would mix them before pouring the batter into the waffle plates. This feature would streamline the cooking process and minimize cleanup, making it more convenient for busy mornings.",
    "**Temperature Control and Customization Features**: Equip the waffle iron with adjustable temperature settings and a digital display that allows users to customize the crispiness of their waffles. This feature would enable users to achieve their desired texture, whether they prefer soft and fluffy or crispy and golden-brown waffles.",
    "**Self-Cleaning Functionality**: Introduce a self-cleaning mechanism that uses steam and heat to clean the plates after use. Users would simply need to add water to a designated compartment, and the waffle iron would heat up to create steam that loosens any stuck batter. This would significantly reduce the hassle of cleaning and make the appliance more appealing to users.",
    "**Waffle Iron with Built-in Recipe Book**: Design a waffle iron that includes a digital screen with a built-in recipe book. Users can browse through various waffle recipes, including savory and sweet options, and follow step-by-step instructions. This feature would inspire users to try new flavors and techniques, enhancing their cooking experience."
