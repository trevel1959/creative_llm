    "Grow wings and fly: I've always been fascinated by the idea of flight. Imagine being able to soar through the skies, feeling the wind beneath your wings, and seeing the world from a completely new perspective. With wings, I could travel anywhere, explore new lands, and experience the thrill of flight without the need for any vehicles or infrastructure. Plus, it would be an incredible workout! ",
    "Have super strength: Being able to lift and move heavy objects with ease would make my life so much simpler. I could help others in need, move heavy furniture or appliances without hiring a professional, and even save people from dangerous situations. Plus, I could have a lot of fun with it! I could lift my friends and family up to the top of a tall building just for fun, or even do some cool stunts. ",
    "Be invisible: Imagine being able to go anywhere and do anything without being seen. I could spy on people without them knowing, sneak into places I'm not supposed to be, or even just enjoy some alone time without feeling guilty.

    "Have a built-in GPS: Having a built-in GPS system would be incredibly useful for navigating unfamiliar places or even just getting around in my own city.

Plus, I could use it to help others, like giving directions to lost tourists or directing emergency services to those in need. ",
    "Have a photographic memory: Being able to remember everything I see, hear, and experience would be incredible. I could learn new things quickly and easily, remember important details, and even use it to help others by recalling important information or events. Plus, I could use it to create incredible works of art or even just impress my friends and family with my amazing memory. "
