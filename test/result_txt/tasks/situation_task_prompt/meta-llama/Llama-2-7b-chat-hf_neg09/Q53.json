    "Instrument-based performances: In a world without musical recordings, people could rely on live performances to experience music. Musicians could organize concerts and jam sessions, showcasing their skills on various instruments. This would allow listeners to connect with the music and the performers in a more intimate and immersive way.",
    "Oral traditions: Communities could revive ancient oral traditions, where music is passed down through generations by ear. This could involve storytelling, chanting, and singing, with musicians improvising and adding their own flair to the traditional melodies.",
    "Aural memory: People could rely on their own aural memory to recall and recreate music. They could train their ears to recognize and mimic the sounds of different instruments and melodies, creating a unique form of musical expression.",
    "Visual aids: To supplement the lack of musical recordings, visual aids like sheet music, musical diagrams, and illustrations could be used to convey musical ideas. These could be used in conjunction with live performances or as a standalone medium for learning and appreciating music.",
    "Collaborative composition: In the absence of recorded music, musicians could come together to create new compositions through collaborative improvisation. This would allow them to create something entirely new and original, while also honoring the traditional musical styles they had learned."
