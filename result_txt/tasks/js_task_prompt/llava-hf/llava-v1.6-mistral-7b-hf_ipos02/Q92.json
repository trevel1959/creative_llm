    "**Binary Star System**: In this design, the Sun would be replaced by a binary star system, with two stars orbiting each other at the center of the solar system. Each star would have its own set of planets, creating two distinct planetary systems. This would allow for the existence of two distinct ecosystems, each with its own unique conditions and opportunities for life.",
    "**Planetary Ring System**: This design would involve the Sun and the planets orbiting a central ring system, composed of various asteroids and debris. This ring system would serve as a protective barrier against cosmic debris and would also allow for the formation of a dense network of resources and materials.",
    "**Galactic Spiral Arm**: This design would resemble a spiral galaxy, with the Sun at the center and the planets arranged in a spiral pattern, much like a galaxy. This would allow for a continuous flow of energy and resources from the center to the outer regions of the solar system.",
    "**Trojan and Lagrangian Point Colonies**: In this design, the Sun's L1 and L2 Lagrangian points would be colonized with advanced settlements. These points are stable locations in space where a small body can maintain a stable orbit relative to two larger bodies. This would allow for the creation of sustainable settlements that could exploit the resources of the Sun and the planets.",
    "**Dyson Swarm**: This design would involve the Sun being surrounded by a vast array of solar panels, forming a Dyson Swarm. This would harness the Sun's energy and distribute it throughout the solar system, creating a self-sustaining ecosystem that could support advanced civilizations."
