    "Glasses-free Vision Aids: Developing non-invasive, hands-free devices that use artificial intelligence to enhance and correct vision. These devices could be worn like a headband or mounted on eyeglasses and use sensors to detect and adjust to the user's eye movements, providing a seamless vision correction experience.",
    "Advanced Corneal Implants: Engineers could develop corneal implants that could restore vision in individuals with mild to moderate vision loss. These implants would be designed to mimic the natural lens of the eye, allowing for focusing and magnification.",
    "Bionic Eye Technology: Harnessing the power of artificial intelligence and machine learning, researchers could create bionic eyes that can bypass damaged or non-functional retinas to directly stimulate the visual cortex. This would provide a more natural and intuitive visual experience for individuals with severe vision loss.",
    "Virtual Reality Vision Rehabilitation: Developing immersive virtual reality environments that simulate real-world situations, allowing individuals with poor vision to practice and improve their visual skills. These environments could include tasks such as navigating through a busy street or recognizing objects in a cluttered room.",
    "Personalized Gene Therapy: Scientists could identify the genetic causes of vision loss in specific populations and develop targeted gene therapies to restore vision. This could involve introducing healthy copies of the missing or faulty genes into the affected cells, allowing for the restoration of vision."
