    "Quantum Flux Energy: This new form of energy would be derived from the quantum realm, harnessing the power of subatomic particles. It would be an ethereal, constantly shifting energy that could be manipulated to create unique effects. For example, a user could generate a field of quantum flux that would allow them to teleport short distances, or create a localized quantum flux bubble that would grant them temporary invincibility.",
    "Echo Energy: This energy source would be based on the concept of sound waves, but instead of being limited to audible frequencies, it would encompass all forms of vibrational energy. Users could manipulate the energy to create powerful sonic blasts, generate force fields, or even manipulate the molecular structure of objects.",
    "Graviton Energy: Tapping into the mysterious forces of gravity, this energy source would allow users to manipulate the fabric of spacetime itself. They could create gravitational fields, manipulate the weight of objects, or even teleport themselves or others across vast distances.",
    "Nexus Energy: Drawing inspiration from the complex networks of neurons in the human brain, this energy source would be based on the concept of interconnectedness. Users could harness the power of this energy to enhance their cognitive abilities, create complex neural networks, or even communicate with other beings directly through a shared nexus.",
    "Aether Energy: This energy source would be based on the hypothetical fifth element, aether, which was thought to be the fundamental substance of the universe. Users could manipulate aether to create powerful blasts of energy, generate shields, or even bend the fabric of reality to their will."
