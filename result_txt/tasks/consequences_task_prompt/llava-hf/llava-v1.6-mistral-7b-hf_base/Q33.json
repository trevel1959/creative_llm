    "Habitat Adjustments: Animals growing to twice their size would require larger habitats to accommodate their increased size. This would put pressure on natural habitats and require larger areas of land or water to be preserved or created.",
    "Food Supply: The increased size of animals would require more food to sustain them, putting pressure on food resources and potentially impacting the food chain.",
    "Hunting and Fishing: The larger size of animals would make them more challenging to hunt or fish, requiring more skill and resources to capture them.",
    "Impact on Ecosystems: The larger size of animals could disrupt the balance of ecosystems, as their increased weight and size could cause more damage to plants and habitats.",
    "Breeding and Reproduction: The larger size of animals could impact their ability to reproduce, as mating and birthing processes might become more difficult due to the increased size and weight."
