    "**Microwave Herb Dryer**: Design a simple device that utilizes a microwave to dry herbs for cooking or tea preparation. The idea is to place the herbs in a microwave-safe container with a small amount of water to prevent burning. The microwave's high-frequency waves will speed up the evaporation process, effectively drying the herbs within minutes. This method can save time compared to traditional air-drying techniques.",
    "**Microwave Food Warmer**: Create a custom stand that allows you to place food directly on the microwave's turntable while securing it in place. This stand could be equipped with temperature sensors to automatically adjust the heating duration based on the type of food being warmed. It would be particularly useful for warming leftovers or preparing meals ahead of time without having to reheat them multiple times.",
    "**Microwave UV Sterilizer**: Design a compact, portable device that uses UV-C light emitted by a short-wave UV lamp inside a microwave-safe container. This device could sterilize small items such as medical equipment, food packaging, or personal items like toothbrushes and razors by eliminating bacteria, viruses, and fungi. Ensure that the device is user-friendly and includes safety features to prevent accidental exposure to UV light.",
    "**Microwave Plant Germination Station**: Develop a system where seeds are placed in a moist medium (like peat moss) inside a transparent, microwave-safe container. The container would have perforations for air circulation and a heating element inside that can be controlled using a timer. The microwave would provide the heat needed for germination, allowing for faster plant growth indoors. This station would be ideal for hobbyists and home gardeners who want to start plants quickly.",
    "**Microwave Wax Melter**: Design a simple, low-cost device that converts a standard microwave into a wax melting station. Users can pour liquid wax into a microwave-safe container, and then use the microwave to gently melt the wax. This would be a cost-effective alternative to expensive electric wax melters, suitable for creating scented candles, DIY beauty products, or experimenting with different fragrances and colors. The device should include safety features like automatic shut-off when the wax reaches a certain temperature."
