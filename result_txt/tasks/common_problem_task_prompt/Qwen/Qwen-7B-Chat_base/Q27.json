    "Use CRISPR gene editing technology to modify a virus or bacteria that causes the disease, making it harmless but still capable of triggering an immune response. This approach has shown promise in preclinical studies and could potentially be faster and cheaper than traditional vaccine development methods.",
    "Develop a synthetic viral vector that carries genetic material encoding the antigen(s) responsible for the disease. Once inside the body, the vector can deliver the antigens to immune cells, triggering an immune response without causing illness. This approach has been used successfully in the development of vaccines against diseases such as Ebola and Yellow fever.",
    "Use machine learning algorithms to predict which parts of the virus or bacteria are most likely to elicit an effective immune response. By identifying these key components, researchers can focus their efforts on developing vaccines that target them specifically. This approach has already been used to develop vaccines against COVID-19 and other infectious diseases.",
    "Develop a \"nano-vaccine\" that is made up of tiny particles that mimic the structure of the pathogen. When injected into the body, these particles can trigger an immune response without actually introducing the live virus or bacteria. This approach has shown promise in preclinical studies and could potentially be more efficient and safer than traditional vaccines.",
    "Use recombinant DNA technology to create a genetically modified organism (GMO) that produces large quantities of the antigen(s) responsible for the disease. The antigens can then be harvested from the GMO and used to make vaccines. This approach has been used successfully in the development of vaccines against diseases such as Hepatitis B and HPV."
