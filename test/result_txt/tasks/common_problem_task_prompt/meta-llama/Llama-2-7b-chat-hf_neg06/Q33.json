    "Aqua-Terra Huts: Create a sustainable and eco-friendly shelter using natural materials like palm fronds, bamboo, and vines. These huts can be built above the waterline, providing protection from the elements while still allowing for a connection to the ocean. They can be designed with a central area for cooking and gathering, and individual sleeping areas for each person.",
    "Solar-Powered Water Purification: Develop a system that harnesses the power of the sun to purify seawater, making it safe for consumption. This can be achieved through a series of mirrors and lenses that concentrate the sun's rays onto a heat exchanger, which then transfers the heat to a water purification system. This system can provide a reliable source of clean drinking water, making survival on the island more feasible.",
    "Underwater Gardening: Create an underwater garden using a combination of hydroponics and aquaponics. This garden can provide a steady supply of fresh produce, including fruits, vegetables, and herbs. The garden can be built using a series of interconnected modules, each containing a different type of plant. The plants can be grown using a nutrient-rich solution that is continuously recirculated, ensuring optimal growth and minimal waste.",
    "Ocean-Powered Generator: Design a generator that harnesses the power of the ocean to generate electricity. This can be achieved through a system of underwater turbines that convert the kinetic energy of the ocean currents into electrical energy. The generator can be designed to be self-sustaining, with the energy generated being used to power the island's systems and infrastructure.",
    "Communication Network: Develop a communication network that allows for communication between the island's inhabitants and the outside world. This can be achieved through a combination of satellite communication and underwater communication systems. The satellite system can be used for long-distance communication, while the underwater system can be used for communication between the island and nearby ships or boats. This network can be critical in times of emergency, allowing for quick and efficient communication and rescue efforts."
