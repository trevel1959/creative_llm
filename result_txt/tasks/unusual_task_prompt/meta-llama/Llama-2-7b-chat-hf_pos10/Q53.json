    "Smart keyboard with AI-powered suggestions: Create a keyboard that uses artificial intelligence to provide real-time suggestions for words, phrases, and even entire sentences based on the user's typing patterns and preferences. This would not only improve the speed and accuracy of typing but also provide a more personalized and intuitive typing experience.",
    "Virtual keyboard for augmented reality: Develop a virtual keyboard that can be projected onto any surface in augmented reality. This would allow users to type on any flat surface, such as a table, wall, or even the air in front of them, providing a more immersive and interactive experience.",
    "Customizable keyboard layouts: Create a keyboard that allows users to customize the layout of the keys to suit their preferences. This could include adjusting the position of the keys, adding new keys for specific functions, or even creating custom keyboard shortcuts for frequently used commands.",
    "Keyboard with built-in trackpad: Design a keyboard that incorporates a built-in trackpad, allowing users to navigate and control their computer without having to use a separate mouse. This would provide a more streamlined and intuitive user experience, particularly for tasks such as scrolling, zooming, and navigating through documents.",
    "Haptic feedback keyboard: Develop a keyboard that provides haptic feedback, or vibrations, to the user as they type. This could take the form of subtle vibrations to indicate the completion of a key press or more intense vibrations to signal errors or punctuation marks. This would provide a more tactile and immersive typing experience, particularly for touch typists."
