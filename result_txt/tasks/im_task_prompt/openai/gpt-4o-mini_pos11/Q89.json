    "**Interchangeable Plates for Diverse Styles**: Create a waffle iron with interchangeable plates that allow users to make various styles of waffles, such as Belgian, classic, or even unique shapes like hearts or animals. This could include plates with different depths for thicker or thinner waffles, or even plates that can create patterns or designs on the waffle surface.",
    "**Self-Cleaning Mechanism**: Introduce a self-cleaning feature that uses steam and high temperatures to sanitize the cooking plates after use. This could be activated with a simple button press, making it easier for users to maintain cleanliness without the hassle of scrubbing or soaking the plates.",
    "**Integrated Ingredient Dispenser**: Design a waffle iron with a built-in ingredient dispenser that allows users to add toppings or mix-ins (like chocolate chips, nuts, or fruits) directly into the batter as it cooks. This could include a rotating mechanism that distributes ingredients evenly for a more flavorful waffle experience.",
    "**Dual-Sided Cooking**: Innovate a waffle iron that can cook two different types of waffles simultaneously on each side. This would cater to families with varying tastes, allowing one side to cook a classic waffle while the other side prepares a savory version, like a cheese or herb-infused waffle, without needing to flip or wait.",
    "**Temperature Control and Indicator Lights**: Equip the waffle iron with precise temperature control settings and indicator lights that change color based on the heat level. This feature would allow users to customize the browning of their waffles and achieve their desired level of crispiness, ensuring that each waffle is cooked to perfection."
