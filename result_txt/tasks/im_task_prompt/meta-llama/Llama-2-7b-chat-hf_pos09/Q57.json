    "Customizable Shape and Size: Create a mouse that can be molded into different shapes and sizes to accommodate various hand sizes and preferences. This would allow users to tailor their mouse to their specific needs and find the most comfortable fit.",
    "Built-in Ergonomic Support: Design a mouse that includes built-in ergonomic support, such as a curved design or a contoured grip, to reduce strain on the hand and wrist. This would help users work comfortably for extended periods without experiencing fatigue.",
    "Interactive Feedback: Develop a mouse that provides interactive feedback to the user, such as vibrations or color-changing patterns, to enhance the user experience. For example, the mouse could vibrate when the user reaches the edge of a scrolling area or change color to indicate when a button has been pressed.",
    "Integrated Trackball: Create a mouse that incorporates a trackball into the design, allowing users to navigate by rotating the ball with their thumb rather than using a traditional left-click/right-click mechanism. This would be particularly useful for users who prefer a more intuitive and precise way of navigating on their computer.",
    "Virtual Reality Compatibility: Design a mouse that is specifically optimized for use with virtual reality (VR) headsets. This could include features such as motion sensing, haptic feedback, or even a VR-specific button layout to enhance the VR experience."
