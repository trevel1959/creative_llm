    "Everyone in the world would have to learn and practice gratitude: If everyone in the world had to follow one rule, I would propose that they all had to learn and practice gratitude. Gratitude is the practice of recognizing and appreciating the good things in our lives, no matter how small they may seem. By cultivating a sense of gratitude, individuals would become more positive, more empathetic, and more compassionate towards others. It would lead to a more harmonious and content society.",
    "Mandatory volunteer work: Requiring everyone to volunteer their time and skills towards a cause they are passionate about would not only benefit the community but also the individual. Volunteering has been shown to improve mental health, increase empathy, and foster a sense of purpose. By making volunteering a global rule, people would be more inclined to give back to their communities, and the world would become a better place.",
    "Universal language education: If everyone in the world had to follow one rule, I would propose that they all had to learn a second language. Language barriers are a significant obstacle to communication and understanding between cultures. By learning a second language, people would gain a deeper appreciation for other cultures and be better equipped to connect with people from diverse backgrounds. This would promote global understanding, tolerance, and peace.",
    "A daily 30-minute digital detox: In today's digital age, it's easy to get caught up in the constant stream of notifications and endless scrolling. To combat this, I would propose that everyone in the world had to dedicate 30 minutes each day to a digital detox. This would give people a chance to disconnect from their devices, relax, and recharge. It would also help reduce stress, improve mental health, and promote a healthier balance between technology and human connection.",
    "A global fund for art and creativity: If everyone in the world had to follow one rule, I would propose that they all had to contribute a small portion of their income towards a global fund for art and creativity. This fund would provide financial support to aspiring artists, musicians, writers, and creators from all over the world. By investing in the arts, we would foster a culture of creativity, innovation, and expression."
