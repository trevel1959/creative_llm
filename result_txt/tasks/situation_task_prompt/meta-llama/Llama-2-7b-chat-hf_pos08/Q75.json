    "Solar Powered Vehicles: One possible solution to power vehicles if all the world's oil disappeared is to switch to solar-powered vehicles. Solar panels could be installed on the roof of the vehicle, or even integrated into the body of the car, allowing the vehicle to harness the energy of the sun to power its engines. This would provide a clean and sustainable source of energy, reducing the dependence on fossil fuels and minimizing the impact on the environment.",
    "Hydrogen Fuel Cells: Another option for powering vehicles without oil is to use hydrogen fuel cells. Hydrogen can be extracted from various sources, including water, and converted into a clean-burning fuel that can power vehicles. Hydrogen fuel cells are efficient, produce only water vapor and heat as emissions, and have the potential to significantly reduce greenhouse gas emissions.",
    "Electric Vehicles with Advanced Batteries: As technology advances, electric vehicles (EVs) are becoming more practical and efficient. With the development of advanced batteries, EVs can travel longer distances without needing to recharge, making them a viable alternative to gasoline-powered vehicles. Additionally, the batteries can be powered by renewable energy sources, such as wind or solar power, further reducing the carbon footprint of transportation.",
    "Biofuels: Biofuels are another alternative to oil for powering vehicles. These fuels are made from organic matter, such as agricultural waste, algae, or even carbon dioxide, and can be converted into a liquid fuel that can power vehicles. Biofuels offer a sustainable and renewable source of energy, reducing the dependence on fossil fuels and decreasing greenhouse gas emissions.",
    "Advanced Materials for Lightweight Vehicles: To reduce the weight of vehicles and improve fuel efficiency, advanced materials such as carbon fiber, magnesium, or advanced composites could be used. By using these lightweight materials, vehicles can travel farther on a single tank of fuel, reducing the need for oil and minimizing the environmental impact of transportation."
