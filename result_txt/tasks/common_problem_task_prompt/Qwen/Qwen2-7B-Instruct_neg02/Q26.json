    "**Virtual Reality Everest Expedition**: Create an immersive virtual reality experience that simulates climbing Mount Everest. This could involve high-quality 3D graphics, realistic sound effects, and interactive elements that simulate the physical and mental challenges of a real climb. Participants can use VR headsets to feel like they're physically climbing the mountain, complete with altitude sickness, weather changes, and breathtaking views. This allows people to experience the thrill of climbing Everest without the risks and physical demands.",

    "**Everest Virtual Challenge**: Launch a global online challenge where participants compete to virtually climb Mount Everest as many times as possible within a set period (e.g., one month). Participants track their progress using fitness apps or wearables, which calculate the number of steps or calories burned equivalent to climbing the mountain. This initiative promotes physical activity and healthy competition while raising awareness about the beauty and dangers of Mount Everest.",

By promoting sustainable tourism, these tours encourage visitors to appreciate the mountain's natural beauty while supporting the preservation of the surrounding ecosystem.",
    "**Everest Mental Health Summit**: Organize an international summit focused on the psychological aspects of climbing Mount Everest. The event could bring together psychologists, psychiatrists, mountaineers, and researchers to discuss topics such as decision-making under extreme conditions, team dynamics, and overcoming mental barriers.
