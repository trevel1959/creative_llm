    "A Smart Cookie Jar with a Twist: Create a cookie jar that can identify the type of cookie inserted and display the information on a small screen. The jar could use image recognition technology to analyze the cookie's shape, size, and color, and then use this information to identify the type of cookie. For example, if a chocolate chip cookie is inserted, the jar could display \"Chocolate Chip Cookie\" on the screen. This would make it easier for people to keep track of their cookie intake and make healthier choices.",
    "Cookie Jar with a Built-in Cooler: Design a cookie jar that has a built-in cooler to keep cookies fresh for longer. The cooler could use a small refrigeration unit to keep the cookies at a consistent temperature, ensuring they stay soft and delicious for hours. This would be especially useful for people who want to enjoy their cookies without worrying about them going stale.",
    "Interactive Cookie Jar with Games: Create a cookie jar that incorporates games and activities to make snack time more fun. For example, the jar could have a built-in game board that lights up when a cookie is inserted. The player could then use a small controller to play games like \"Cookie Tetris\" or \"Cookie Puzzle.\" This would make snack time more engaging and enjoyable for kids and adults alike.",
    "Customizable Cookie Jar with Personalized Labels: Design a cookie jar that allows users to customize the labels on the jar to reflect their personality or preferences. Users could choose from a variety of templates or create their own designs using a mobile app. This would make the cookie jar a fun and personalized addition to any kitchen.",
    "Cookie Jar with a Built-in Scale: Create a cookie jar that has a built-in scale to measure the weight of the cookies. This would be especially useful for people who are trying to manage their weight or track their snack intake. The scale could be calibrated to display the weight of the cookies in grams or ounces, making it easy to keep track of portion sizes. This would be a unique and practical feature that would make the cookie jar stand out from other designs."
