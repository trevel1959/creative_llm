    "**Vapor Inhalers**: Develop a new type of vapor inhaler that uses essential oils or extracts from plants known for their anti-inflammatory and anti-viral properties. This could include oils like eucalyptus, peppermint, or thyme, which are believed to help clear nasal passages and soothe throat irritation.",
    "**Probiotic Lozenges**: Create lozenges that contain probiotics specifically designed to promote a healthy balance in the gut microbiome, which can influence immune function. By strengthening the gut, these lozenges may indirectly support the body's ability to fight off colds.",
    "**Nano-Particle Treatment**: Research and develop a nano-sized particle that can be sprayed directly onto the skin or inhaled, containing a mix of antiviral agents. This treatment aims to disrupt the virus's ability to replicate within the body, potentially preventing the onset of a cold.",
    "**Virtual Reality Therapy**: Design a VR system that immerses users in a relaxing environment, reducing stress and enhancing sleep quality.
