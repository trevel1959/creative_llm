    "**Liability and Insurance Issues**: In the event of an accident involving a self-driving car, determining liability can become complicated. Is it the manufacturer's fault for a software malfunction, or is it the owner's fault for not maintaining the vehicle properly? This ambiguity can lead to legal disputes and challenges in the insurance industry, as traditional policies may not adequately cover autonomous vehicles.",
    "**Ethical Dilemmas in Decision-Making**: Self-driving cars are programmed to make decisions in critical situations, such as choosing between the safety of the occupants or pedestrians. These ethical dilemmas raise questions about how these decisions are programmed and who is responsible for the outcomes, leading to public debate and potential regulatory challenges.",
    "**Job Displacement**: The widespread adoption of self-driving cars could lead to significant job losses in driving-related professions, such as taxi drivers, truck drivers, and delivery personnel. This displacement may cause economic and social issues, requiring a rethinking of workforce training and transition strategies for those affected.",
    "**Infrastructure Challenges**: Self-driving cars may require specific infrastructure adaptations, such as dedicated lanes, charging stations, or communication systems to interact with traffic signals and other vehicles. The lack of necessary infrastructure could hinder the effective operation of self-driving vehicles and create disparities between urban and rural areas.",
    "**User Dependency and Skill Degradation**: As people become accustomed to relying on self-driving technology, there may be a decline in driving skills among the general population. This dependency could pose risks if a driver needs to take control in an emergency situation, potentially leading to accidents due to lack of practice or confidence."
