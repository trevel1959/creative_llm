    "Economic Boost: If all world debt was erased, it would lead to an immediate economic boost as people would have more money to spend on goods and services, leading to increased demand and economic growth. This could also lead to lower interest rates, as lenders would be more willing to lend money at lower rates since they would not have the burden of debt.",
