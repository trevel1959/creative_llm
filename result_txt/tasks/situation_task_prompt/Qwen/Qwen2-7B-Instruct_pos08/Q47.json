    "**Sun Hat with UV Protection:** This idea involves using a sun hat specifically designed for sun protection. These hats often come with features like wide brims that shield the face and neck, as well as UPF (Ultraviolet Protection Factor) ratings. The hat would be a stylish and practical solution to protect the scalp from harmful UV rays.",
    "**Wearable Sunscreen Cap:** A creative option could be to develop a cap infused with sunscreen. The cap could have a layer of sunscreen material that is activated by sunlight or when in contact with water, offering continuous protection against UV rays. This would be an innovative approach to protect bald heads from sunburn.",
    "**Reflective Fabric Cap:** Utilize a cap made from reflective fabric that helps deflect the sun's rays away from the scalp. The fabric could be coated with a reflective material or have a special weave that enhances its ability to reflect light. This would create a physical barrier between the scalp and direct sunlight.",
    "**Smart Headwear with Cooling Technology:** Develop a smart cap equipped with cooling technology to maintain a lower temperature on the scalp. This could involve integrated fans or phase change materials that absorb heat from the scalp, keeping it cooler and reducing the risk of sunburn. Additionally, these caps could be connected to a smartphone app for monitoring and adjusting settings according to environmental conditions.",
    "**Customized Hair Replacement Solution:** For a more permanent solution, one could explore options such as custom-made bald caps, wigs, or hairpieces that are designed to fit securely and provide comprehensive coverage. These items can be tailored to match skin tone and can be crafted with advanced materials that offer UV protection. Regular maintenance and replacement could ensure continued protection against sunburn."
