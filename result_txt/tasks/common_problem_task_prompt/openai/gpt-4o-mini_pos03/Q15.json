    "**Invasive Species**: Introducing non-native plants can lead to problems with invasive species that outcompete local flora and disrupt the ecosystem. Gardeners should research native plants and consider their growth habits before planting. To prevent invasiveness, they can choose native species that support local wildlife and maintain the ecological balance, ensuring a sustainable garden.",
    "**Pest Infestations**: A common issue in gardening is dealing with pests that can damage plants and reduce yield. Early detection is key, and gardeners can implement integrated pest management (IPM) strategies, which include using beneficial insects, companion planting, and organic pest control methods. Regular monitoring and maintaining plant health can help deter pests before they become a significant problem.",
    "**Watering Challenges**: Overwatering or underwatering can severely affect plant health. Inconsistent watering schedules can lead to root rot or drought stress. Gardeners should implement a watering plan that considers the specific needs of each plant and the local climate. Installing a drip irrigation system or using moisture sensors can help maintain consistent soil moisture levels.",
    "**Sunlight Availability**: Insufficient sunlight can stunt plant growth and reduce flowering or fruiting. Gardeners need to assess the sunlight patterns in their backyard to determine the best planting locations. If certain areas receive too much shade, they may need to trim back overhanging branches or choose shade-tolerant plants that thrive in lower light conditions.",
    "**Competing Weeds**: Weeds can quickly take over a garden, competing for nutrients, water, and sunlight. Regular maintenance is necessary to keep weeds at bay. Gardeners can use mulch to suppress weed growth, practice crop rotation, and hand-pull weeds before they set seed. Establishing a dense planting arrangement can also help shade out potential weeds."
