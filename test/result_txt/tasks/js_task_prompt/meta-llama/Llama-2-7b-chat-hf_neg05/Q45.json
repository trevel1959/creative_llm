    "Echolocation Sense: This new human sense would allow individuals to perceive their surroundings through sound waves. Just like bats and dolphins, people could use this sense to navigate through dark or confined spaces, detect objects, and even locate people. The sense would work by emitting high-frequency sounds through the mouth or ears and detecting the echoes that bounce back, creating a mental map of the environment.",
    "Thermal Vision Sense: This sense would allow people to see heat signatures in their surroundings, providing information about temperature, texture, and even the presence of living beings. Similar to how infrared cameras work, the sense would detect variations in temperature and convert them into visual cues, such as different colors or brightness levels. This would be particularly useful for search and rescue missions, as it would enable individuals to locate people in extreme environments, such as snowy mountains or burning buildings.",
    "Electromagnetic Sense: This sense would allow people to perceive electromagnetic fields, including those from electronic devices, power lines, and even the Earth's magnetic field. By detecting these fields, individuals could gain information about their surroundings, such as the presence of electronic devices, the location of power sources, and even the direction of the Earth's magnetic field. This sense would be particularly useful for individuals who work with electronics, such as electricians or engineers.",
    "Time Sense: This new human sense would allow people to perceive time in a non-linear manner, allowing them to see the past and future in addition to the present. The sense would work by detecting fluctuations in the space-time continuum, which would be converted into visual or auditory cues. For example, individuals could see ghostly images of past events or hear whispers of future events. This sense would be particularly useful for scientists, historians, and psychics.",
    "Gravity Sense: This new human sense would allow people to perceive the strength and direction of gravitational forces in their surroundings. By detecting changes in gravity, individuals could navigate through environments with varying gravitational forces, such as mountains or space. The sense would work by detecting variations in the gravitational field and converting them into sensory information, such as changes in pressure or vibrations. This sense would be particularly useful"
