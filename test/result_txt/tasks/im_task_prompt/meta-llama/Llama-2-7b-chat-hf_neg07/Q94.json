    "Scent-sational: Create a candle line that incorporates unique and alluring scents, such as \"Midnight Garden\" (a blend of lavender, jasmine, and rose), \"Cozy Fireplace\" (a warm, spicy blend of cinnamon, vanilla, and musk), or \"Boho Beach\" (a tropical mix of coconut, pineapple, and a hint of sea salt). Each candle could be packaged in a decorative, eco-friendly container to enhance the overall experience.",
    "Artisanal Art: Collaborate with local artists to create one-of-a-kind, hand-painted candle designs. The artists could use a variety of techniques, such as layering, blending, and dripping, to create unique, visually striking designs. This would not only add a creative touch to the candles but also provide a platform for local artists to showcase their talents.",
    "Customizable Candles: Offer a custom candle-making service where customers can choose the scent, color, and shape of their candle. This could be done through an interactive website or in-store experience. Customers could also have the option to personalize their candle with their name or a special message, making it a unique and thoughtful gift.",
    "Wellness Candles: Create candles specifically designed to promote relaxation and wellness. These candles could be infused with essential oils such as lavender, chamomile, or peppermint, which are known for their calming properties. The candles could also be packaged in a way that promotes mindfulness, such as a meditation guide or a breathing exercise, to enhance the overall wellness experience.",
    "Interactive Candle Experience: Create an immersive candle-based experience that combines scent, sound, and light. The candle could be designed with a built-in speaker that plays soothing music or nature sounds, and the light could be programmed to change colors and patterns in sync with the music. This would create a multisensory experience that transports the user to a peaceful and relaxing environment."
