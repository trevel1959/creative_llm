    "Build a Greenhouse: One creative solution to regulate indoor temperature without heaters or air conditioners is to construct a greenhouse. A greenhouse uses natural sunlight to warm up the interior space, which can be supplemented with thermal mass materials like concrete, brick, or stone to store heat during the night. This way, the greenhouse can maintain a consistent temperature throughout the day, providing a comfortable and energy-efficient indoor environment.",
    "Insulate with Straw: Another creative solution is to use straw as an insulation material. Straw has excellent thermal insulation properties and can be used to line walls, floors, and ceilings. By using straw, heat can be retained inside the building, reducing the need for heaters or air conditioners. Additionally, straw can be used to create a passive ventilation system, allowing fresh air to circulate and cool the space naturally.",
    "Utilize Thermal Curtains: Thermal curtains are a simple and effective solution to regulate indoor temperature. These curtains are made of materials that can absorb and release heat, such as wool, cotton, or bamboo. By closing the curtains during the night, the heat can be retained inside the building, while during the day, the curtains can be opened to allow the heat to escape. This way, the temperature can be maintained at a comfortable level without the need for heaters or air conditioners.",
    "Employ Phase Change Materials: Phase change materials (PCMs) are substances that can absorb and release heat energy as they change phase from solid to liquid or vice versa. By incorporating PCMs into building materials, such as walls, floors, or ceilings, the temperature inside the building can be regulated. When the temperature drops, the PCMs will absorb heat from the environment and release it back when the temperature rises, providing a consistent and stable indoor climate.",
    "Install a Passive Solar Chimney: A passive solar chimney is a structure that uses natural convection to circulate air and regulate the temperature inside a building. By constructing a chimney with a large enough volume and a narrow opening, the chimney can create a convective current that pulls warm air from the top of the building and push"
