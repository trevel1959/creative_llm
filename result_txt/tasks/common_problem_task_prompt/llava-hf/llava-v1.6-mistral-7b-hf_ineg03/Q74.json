    "**Technical Malfunctions**: There is always a risk of technical malfunctions during the launch process. If any of the launch vehicle's systems fail, the satellite may not reach its intended orbit or may be lost.",
    "**Navigation and Control**: Once the satellite is in space, it needs to be navigated and controlled. If the communication link between the satellite and ground control fails, the satellite may become lost or be unable to perform its intended functions.",
    "**Debris and Collisions**: There is a risk of debris in space, such as defunct satellites or spacecraft, that could collide with the satellite, causing damage or failure.",
    "**Reentry and Landing**: When the satellite reaches the end of its operational life, it must be deorbited and brought back to Earth. This process can be risky and may involve the possibility of the satellite reentering the atmosphere and burning up or landing in a populated area.",
    "**Space Weather**: The satellite may be affected by space weather events, such as solar flares or geomagnetic storms, which can cause interference with the satellite's communication systems or disrupt its power supply."
