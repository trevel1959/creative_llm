    "**Artificial Sunlight Towers**: Construct large, vertical towers equipped with advanced LED technology that mimics natural sunlight. These towers would be strategically placed around cities and towns, providing bright, full-spectrum light during the day. The light emitted would not only illuminate public spaces but could also be adjusted to simulate different times of day, helping to regulate people's circadian rhythms and improve overall mood and productivity.",
    "**Reflective Light Canopies**: Design and install expansive canopies made of highly reflective materials over urban areas. These canopies would capture and redirect ambient light from artificial sources, such as streetlights and buildings, creating a brighter environment during the day. The canopies could also incorporate solar panels, generating renewable energy while serving the dual purpose of enhancing visibility and reducing heat in urban spaces.",
    "**Light Harvesting Drones**: Develop a fleet of drones equipped with light-harvesting technology that can collect and store energy from existing artificial light sources. These drones would fly around cities during the day, gathering light and then releasing it in designated areas as needed. This system would not only provide illumination but could also be programmed to follow people, creating personalized light trails for individuals as they navigate through darkened environments.",
    "**Glow-in-the-Dark Infrastructure**: Implement glow-in-the-dark materials in urban infrastructure, such as sidewalks, roads, and buildings. These materials would absorb light during the day and emit a soft glow at night, creating a safe and visually appealing environment. This could be particularly useful in parks and outdoor areas, where natural light is essential for safety and recreation.",
    "**Portable Light Pods**: Create portable light pods that individuals can carry with them throughout the day. These pods would utilize a combination of solar panels and energy-efficient LEDs to provide adjustable lighting options. They could be used in homes, workplaces, or outdoor settings, allowing people to customize their light experience according to their needs, whether for reading, working, or socializing."
