    "Beach-themed art gallery: With all the sand gone, you could turn the beach into an art gallery featuring sculptures and installations made from other materials like driftwood, shells, and sea glass. Visitors could admire the creative use of found objects and appreciate the beauty of the ocean without the need for sand.",
    "Underwater exploration park: Instead of a beach, you could create an underwater exploration park where visitors can swim and discover the hidden wonders of the ocean. The park could feature submerged sculptures, coral reefs, and even a sunken ship or two. The lack of sand would allow for a more immersive and interactive experience.",
    "Beachside biodomes: Build large biodomes along the coastline that simulate the conditions of different beach ecosystems, such as mangroves, dunes, and salt marshes. Each biodome could house a variety of plants and animals, providing a unique and protected environment for visitors to explore. The lack of sand would allow for a more controlled and sustainable environment.",
    "Floating islands: Create a series of floating islands in the ocean, each one designed to mimic the unique features of a different beach. The islands could be made from recycled materials and could be connected by a network of bridges and canals. Visitors could explore the islands and enjoy the beach-like atmosphere without the need for sand.",
    "Virtual reality beach: Develop a virtual reality experience that simulates the feeling of being on a beach without the need for physical sand. Visitors could don VR headsets and be transported to a virtual beach environment, complete with waves, sand, and all the other sensory experiences of a real beach. The lack of physical sand would allow for a more immersive and interactive experience."
