    "One day, the parrot spotted an old man who talked to himself all the time. She flew over to him and began to practice her talking skills.",
    "Unsurprisingally, the old man did not talk like any of the other parrots she knew. In fact, he only seemed to grunt and mumble incoherently.",
    "It took some time, but the parrot finally managed to learn to repeat the old man's mumbles.",
    "As time went on, the old man developed an unusual friendship with the parrot. The two became inseparable, and the man began to rely on the parrot to keep him company."
