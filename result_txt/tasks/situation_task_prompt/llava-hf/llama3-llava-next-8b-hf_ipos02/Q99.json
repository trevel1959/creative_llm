    "Shapes: Another way to differentiate between objects would be to focus on their shapes. For instance, the round shape of a ball could be distinguished from the square shape of a book or the rectangular shape of a keyboard. This could be achieved through the use of a ruler or a protractor to measure and draw the shapes.",
    "Sizes: Size can also be used to differentiate between objects. For example, the large size of a book could be distinguished from the small size of a mouse or the tiny size of a key. This could be achieved through the use of a measuring tape or a scale to determine the size of the objects.",
    "Patterns: Patterns can also be used to differentiate between objects. For instance, the striped pattern of a shirt could be distinguished from the dotted pattern of a tie or the solid color of a wall. This could be achieved through the use of a ruler or a protractor to measure and draw the patterns.",
    "Reflections: Reflections can also be used to differentiate between objects. For example, the reflection of a person in a mirror could be distinguished from the reflection of a book on a table. This could be achieved through the use of a mirror or a glass to capture the reflections.",
    "Shadows: Shadows can also be used to differentiate between objects. For instance, the shadow of a person could be distinguished from the shadow of a chair. This could be achieved through the use of a light source or a flashlight to cast shadows on the objects."
