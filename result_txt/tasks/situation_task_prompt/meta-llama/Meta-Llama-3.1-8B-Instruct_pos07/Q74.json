    "**Reimagined uses for household items**: I would repurpose household items to create makeshift cosmetic products. For instance, I'd use coconut oil and beeswax to create a natural lip balm, or mix baking soda and water to create a gentle exfoliating scrub. I'd also utilize everyday items like cotton balls, Q-tips, and even old cloth scraps to create makeshift applicators and tools.",
    "**Nature-inspired beauty routines**: I'd turn to nature for inspiration and create my own beauty products using locally sourced ingredients. I'd forage for wild herbs like chamomile and calendula to create soothing face masks, or collect rose petals to create a natural face toner. I'd also use clay from nearby rivers or streams to create a detoxifying face mask.",
    "**DIY beauty kits**: I'd create a DIY beauty kit using items like empty containers, bottles, and jars. I'd collect and repurpose items like old candles, jam jars, and soap containers to create a variety of cosmetic products. For example, I'd use an old candle to create a homemade candle-based face moisturizer or a jam jar to create a natural face mask.",
    "**Bartering and trading**: I'd establish a network of friends and neighbors to trade skills and resources. I'd offer to help with gardening or cooking in exchange for access to natural ingredients like honey, olive oil, or fresh herbs. I'd also trade skills like makeup application or hair styling for access to rare or hard-to-find ingredients.",
    "**Community-driven beauty**: I'd organize a community-driven beauty initiative where neighbors and friends come together to share knowledge, skills, and resources. We'd create a shared space for DIY beauty projects, where we'd share recipes, techniques, and ingredients. We'd also host workshops and classes to teach each other new skills and share knowledge on natural beauty practices. This way, we'd not only maintain our personal grooming habits but also build a stronger, more connected community. [/INST] "
