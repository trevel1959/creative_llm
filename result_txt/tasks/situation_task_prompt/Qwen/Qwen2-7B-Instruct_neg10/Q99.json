    "**Color Coding System**: Create a unique color code for each object by using patterns or textures instead of color. For example, a series of dots could represent a book, while a line could symbolize a pencil. This system can be easily applied to various objects and allows for differentiation even in a monochromatic world.",
    "**Material Identification**: Since the color disappears, focus on the material of each object. Different materials have distinct textures and sounds when manipulated. You could create a tactile library where you touch and feel objects to differentiate them. For instance, a metal pen might feel colder than a wooden one, and a fabric shirt would have a softer texture compared to a plastic bottle.",
    "**Incorporate Sound**: Each object can produce a unique sound when manipulated or interacted with. For example, a metal spoon could clink against a glass, while a piece of paper might rustle. By creating an auditory catalog of sounds, you can identify objects without relying on their color.",
    "**Scent Identification**: Introduce scented markers or labels that can be attached to objects. Each item can be given a specific scent (like lavender for books, vanilla for candles, etc.), helping to distinguish them from others. This is particularly useful for items like clothing, books, or personal belongings.",
    "**Shape Recognition**: Objects can be designed or labeled with distinct shapes that help in identification. For instance, a round object could be a ball, a cube could be a dice, and a cylinder could be a tube. By creating a variety of shapes, it becomes easier to differentiate between objects based on their geometric properties. This method works well for both flat and three-dimensional items."
