    "Off-grid Energy Harvesting Community: Create a community that harnesses renewable energy sources such as solar, wind, and hydroelectric power to generate electricity. This community would be designed to be self-sustaining, with energy-efficient buildings and appliances, and a focus on reducing waste and carbon emissions.",
    "Solar-Powered Air Travel: Develop a solar-powered aircraft that can fly using only the sun's energy. This aircraft would be designed with lightweight solar panels and advanced energy storage systems, allowing it to fly for extended periods of time without refueling.",
    "Energy-Harvesting Clothing: Design clothing that can harness energy from the wearer's movements and convert it into electricity. This clothing would be made with special fabrics that are woven with energy-harvesting materials, such as piezoelectric fibers, and would be designed for everyday wear.",
    "Community-Scale Wind Turbines: Create a community-scale wind turbine system that can be installed in urban areas to generate electricity. These turbines would be designed to be aesthetically pleasing and would be integrated into the cityscape, providing a sustainable source of energy for the community.",
    "Energy-Harvesting Roadways: Develop a system of energy-harvesting roadways that can capture and convert kinetic energy from traffic into electricity. This system would be made up of specialized roads that are embedded with energy-harvesting materials, such as piezoelectric crystals, and would be designed to be cost-effective and easy to install."
