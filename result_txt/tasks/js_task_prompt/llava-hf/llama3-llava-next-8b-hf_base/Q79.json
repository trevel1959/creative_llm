    "Hyperloop: A high-speed transportation system that uses vacuum-sealed tubes to propel vehicles at speeds of up to 700 mph (1,127 km/h). This would significantly reduce travel time between cities and provide a more sustainable alternative to air and road travel.",
    "Magnetic Levitation Train: A train that uses magnetic levitation technology to float above the tracks, reducing friction and allowing for faster, more efficient travel. This would also reduce the environmental impact of traditional trains.",
    "Solar-Powered Boat: A boat that uses solar panels to harness the power of the sun and propel itself through the water. This would provide a sustainable and eco-friendly alternative to traditional boats and reduce the reliance on fossil fuels.",
    "Vertical Farming Airship: A large, airship-like structure that uses vertical farming techniques to grow food in a controlled environment. This would provide a sustainable and efficient way to produce food, while also reducing the environmental impact of traditional farming methods.",
    "Self-Driving Car: A car that uses advanced artificial intelligence and sensor technology to drive itself, eliminating the need for human intervention. This would reduce the risk of accidents and provide a more efficient and sustainable mode of transportation."
