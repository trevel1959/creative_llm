    "**Plastic Bottle Garden Terrarium**: Use plastic bottles to create miniature indoor gardens. Cut off the top portion of the bottle and use it as a lid for a mini terrarium. Fill the bottom part with small stones or gravel for drainage, then add a layer of soil. Plant small succulents or other low-maintenance plants. This idea can be used in classrooms or offices to promote green spaces and help reduce stress.",
    "**Recycled Plastic Bottle Solar Cooker**: Design a simple solar cooker using plastic bottles. By arranging several bottles in a pyramid shape, you can concentrate sunlight on a single point, allowing you to cook food without fire. Cover the top with aluminum foil to reflect light inward, and use a dark color pot inside to absorb heat efficiently. This project teaches about renewable energy and can be a fun science experiment.",
    "**DIY Plastic Bottle Wind Chime**: Collect plastic bottles of various sizes, cut them into different lengths, and attach them to a string or wire with loops at the tops. Fill each bottle with small objects like pebbles or seeds to create unique sound tones. Hang this wind chime outside to enjoy pleasant sounds from the breeze.",
    "**Plastic Bottle Water Filtration System**: Construct a basic water filter using a plastic bottle. Drill holes along the side of the bottle and insert a filter material such as sand, charcoal, and cotton. The filter traps contaminants while letting clean water pass through. This idea can be especially useful in areas where access to clean water is limited.",
    "**Plastic Bottle Bird Feeder**: Transform an empty plastic bottle into a bird feeder. Punch small holes around the sides of the bottle and thread twine or string through these holes to create a hanger. Fill the bottle with birdseed, leaving enough space at the top for birds to reach the seed. This not only provides food for local wildlife but also encourages observation and appreciation for nature."
