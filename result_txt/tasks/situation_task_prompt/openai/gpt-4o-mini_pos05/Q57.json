    "**Vertical Farming Skyscrapers**: In urban areas, skyscrapers could be transformed into vertical farms that not only produce food but also serve as living spaces. These buildings would be designed with hydroponic and aeroponic systems, providing fresh produce year-round. Residents could live in apartments within the structure while contributing to a community food source. Rooftop gardens and green spaces would enhance air quality and provide recreational areas, making the skyscrapers self-sustaining.",
    "**Underground Habitats**: As a response to rising sea levels, developing underground living spaces could become a viable option. These habitats would be designed with natural ventilation, thermal insulation, and sustainable energy sources. They could be located in regions where the ground is stable and would be insulated from flooding. The use of natural materials and innovative design would create comfortable living environments while also preserving the surface landscape for agriculture and recreation.",
    "**Treehouse Villages**: In areas where flooding is a concern, building treehouse villages in elevated forests could provide a unique living solution. These homes would be built high in the trees, interconnected by bridges and walkways, allowing residents to live among nature while staying safe from rising waters. Each treehouse could be equipped with rainwater collection systems and solar panels, promoting a sustainable lifestyle. The community would focus on conservation and harmony with the surrounding ecosystem.",
    "**Mobile Homes on Barges**: Another innovative idea would be to create mobile homes on barges that can navigate rising waters. These homes would be designed for comfort and mobility, allowing residents to relocate as needed. Each barge could include green spaces, gardens, and communal areas, fostering a sense of community. This solution would also enable families to explore different regions and cultures while maintaining a flexible lifestyle.",
    "**Island Revitalization Projects**: Some coastal areas may become uninhabitable due to rising sea levels, but smaller islands could be revitalized and developed into sustainable living spaces. These islands would be fortified against flooding and designed with renewable energy sources, water filtration systems, and community gardens. Residents could engage in eco-tourism and conservation efforts, preserving the natural beauty of the area while creating a vibrant community."
