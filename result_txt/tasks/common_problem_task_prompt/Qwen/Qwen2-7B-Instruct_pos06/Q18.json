    "**Solar-Powered Tiny House:** Build a small, energy-efficient house that uses solar panels to generate power. This would require a thorough understanding of solar technology, including panel efficiency, battery storage, and inverter systems. The house could also include passive solar design elements like large windows to maximize sunlight, and insulation to keep it warm in winter and cool in summer. Confidence Score: 0.9",
    "**Wind Turbine and Hydroponics Farm:** Utilize a small wind turbine for electricity generation and build a hydroponics farm to grow fresh produce. This idea requires knowledge about wind turbine operation, maintenance, and hydroponic farming techniques. It also involves designing a system that integrates the two to ensure a sustainable living environment. Confidence Score: 0.8",
    "**Off-Grid Community Garden Village:** Create a community where houses are built around shared gardens, which not only provide food but also generate compost and organic waste. Each house could have solar panels and water catchment systems, with shared resources like water tanks and communal kitchens. This idea involves community planning, sustainable architecture, and resource management. Confidence Score: 0.7",
    "**Hand-Cranked Technology:** Design and manufacture devices that can operate manually, such as hand-cranked lights, fans, and even computers. This would require inventing or modifying existing technologies to function without electricity. It would also involve developing ergonomic designs and user-friendly interfaces. Confidence Score: 0.8",
    "**Bioluminescent Plant Lighting:** Cultivate plants that emit light naturally, such as certain species of algae and fungi, to replace artificial lighting. This would involve genetic modification, plant biology, and potentially creating a symbiotic relationship between different plant species to optimize light production. Confidence Score: 0.6"
