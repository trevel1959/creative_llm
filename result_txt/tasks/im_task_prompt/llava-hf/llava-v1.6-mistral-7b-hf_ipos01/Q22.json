    "**Modular Flashlight**: Design a flashlight with interchangeable attachments that can serve different purposes. For example, one attachment could be a magnetized tool that can pick up small objects, another could be a small speaker for playing music or making emergency calls, and a third could be a small first aid kit.",
    "**Eco-Friendly Flashlight**: Create a flashlight with a solar panel that can be charged using sunlight. This would make it more sustainable and environmentally friendly. Additionally, the flashlight could be designed to turn off automatically after a certain period of inactivity to save energy.",
    "**Smart Home Integration**: Develop a flashlight that can be controlled using voice commands or smart home devices. For example, users could turn the flashlight on and off, change its brightness, or switch between different modes (e.g., high, medium, low) without physically touching the flashlight.",
    "**Portable Charging Station**: Incorporate a built-in USB port or charging dock into the flashlight design, allowing users to charge their smartphones or other devices on the go. This would make the flashlight a multi-functional tool.",
    "**LED Light Replacement**: Replace the traditional bulb with an LED light that has a longer lifespan and uses less energy. This would make the flashlight more durable and cost-effective."
