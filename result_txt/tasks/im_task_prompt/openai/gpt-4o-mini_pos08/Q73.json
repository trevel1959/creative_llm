    "**Multi-Functional Key Fob**: Create a key fob that not only unlocks the car but also includes additional features like a built-in flashlight, a bottle opener, and a panic button that can alert emergency services or send an SOS signal to designated contacts. This would add practicality to the key fob, making it a useful tool beyond just starting the car.",
    "**Customizable Key Cover with NFC Technology**: Introduce customizable key covers that come with NFC (Near Field Communication) chips embedded. Users could personalize their key covers with designs or colors and program the NFC chip to perform specific actions when tapped on their phone, such as opening an app, sharing contact information, or linking to a digital business card.",
    "**Keyless Entry with Biometric Authentication**: Develop a keyless entry system that uses biometric authentication, such as fingerprint recognition or facial recognition, to unlock the car. This would enhance security by ensuring that only authorized users can access the vehicle, eliminating the need for physical keys altogether.",
    "**Solar-Powered Key Fob**: Innovate a key fob that is powered by solar energy. By incorporating solar panels into the design, the fob could recharge itself while in the sun, reducing the need for battery replacements. This would make it environmentally friendly and ensure that users never find themselves with a dead key fob.",
    "**Voice-Activated Key Fob**: Create a voice-activated key fob that responds to specific voice commands. Users could unlock their cars or start the engine simply by speaking a designated phrase. This feature would enhance convenience, especially for those who have their hands full or are carrying items when approaching their vehicle."
