    "**Botanical Infusion Method:** This creative idea involves using natural ingredients like herbs, fruits, and spices to create custom blends. For example, a combination of lavender, rose petals, and orange zest could mimic a floral perfume. The process would involve steeping these ingredients in a carrier oil or alcohol for several days, then straining and diluting the extract to use as a scent. ",

By choosing the right waxes and oils, one can craft candles with a variety of scents, from calming lavender to energizing citrus.",
    "**Scented Room Sprays with DIY Base:** Instead of perfumes, creating room sprays can offer versatile and customizable scents.

Adding a few drops of food coloring can also enhance the visual appeal of the spray.",
    "**DIY Scented Jewelry:** Transform everyday jewelry pieces into wearable scents by incorporating essential oils.

Attach these to necklaces, bracelets, or earrings to carry subtle fragrances throughout the day. This not only adds a personal touch but also provides a convenient way to enjoy pleasant scents without relying on traditional perfumes."
