    "**Mood-Shifting Bookshelf**: Design a bookshelf that can change its color and pattern to match the mood of the person interacting with it. Using a combination of LED lights, sensors, and AI, the bookshelf can detect the user's emotions and adjust its appearance accordingly. For example, if the user is feeling stressed, the bookshelf could shift to a calming blue color, while a joyful user might see a vibrant rainbow pattern. This interactive feature would not only add a touch of magic to the user's reading experience but also provide a unique conversation starter.",
