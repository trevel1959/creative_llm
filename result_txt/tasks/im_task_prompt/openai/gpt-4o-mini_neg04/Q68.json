    "**Augmented Reality Display**: Incorporate augmented reality (AR) technology into the calculator. Users could point their smartphone camera at a problem, and the calculator would overlay the solution on the screen in real-time. For instance, when solving geometry problems, users could visualize shapes and angles in 3D, enhancing understanding and engagement with mathematical concepts.",
    "**Personalized Learning Mode**: Create a calculator that adapts to the user’s learning style and proficiency level. It could offer hints, step-by-step solutions, and practice problems based on the user’s performance. For example, if a user struggles with fractions, the calculator could provide targeted exercises and explanations, turning it into a personalized math tutor.",
    "**Gamification Features**: Introduce gamification elements into the calculator, where users can earn points, badges, or rewards for completing calculations, solving puzzles, or mastering new concepts. This could encourage students to engage more with mathematics and make learning fun. For example, a \"Math Quest\" mode could challenge users to solve a series of problems to advance through levels or unlock new features.",
    "**Integration with Educational Platforms**: Allow the calculator to connect seamlessly with online educational platforms, enabling users to import problems from their coursework or homework directly into the calculator. It could also sync progress with educational apps, providing teachers and students with insights into areas needing improvement.",
    "**Solar-Powered and Eco-Friendly Design**: Redesign the calculator to be solar-powered and made from sustainable materials. This would not only reduce battery waste but also promote environmental awareness among users. A sleek, modern design could appeal to eco-conscious consumers, making the calculator a stylish yet responsible choice."
