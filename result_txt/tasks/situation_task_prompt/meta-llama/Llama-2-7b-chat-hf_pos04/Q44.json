    "Bicycle-powered trains: In a world where public transport has stopped working, people could use bicycles to power trains. The trains could be designed with bicycle-like wheels and a frame that would allow people to pedal and generate power. This would provide a sustainable and eco-friendly way to travel long distances without relying on fossil fuels.",
    "Hydrogen-powered boats: With public transportation no longer available, people could use hydrogen-powered boats to travel across waterways. Hydrogen fuel cells would provide a clean and efficient source of energy, reducing the carbon footprint of transportation.",
    "Gravity-powered sleds: In a post-apocalyptic world where technology has failed, people could use gravity-powered sleds to travel long distances. The sleds would be designed with a low center of gravity and a flat bottom, allowing them to glide down hills and valleys with minimal effort.",
    "Solar-powered hot air balloons: With the lack of public transportation, people could use solar-powered hot air balloons to travel long distances. The balloons would be designed with large solar panels that would capture the sun's energy during the day, allowing them to float high above the ground and travel great distances without the need for fuel.",
    "Human-powered maglev trains: In a world where technology has failed, people could use human-powered maglev trains to travel long distances. The trains would be designed with magnetic levitation technology, allowing them to float above the ground without touching it. Passengers would pedal or row to generate power, providing a sustainable and efficient way to travel long distances without relying on fossil fuels."
