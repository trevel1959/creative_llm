    "Plastic-based food packaging would break down in minutes: If plastic could biodegrade as quickly as paper, food packaging made of plastic would decompose rapidly, reducing the amount of plastic waste in landfills and oceans. This would minimize the impact of plastic on marine life and reduce the risk of microplastics entering the food chain.",
    "Plastic bags would become obsolete: With plastic biodegrading quickly, single-use plastic bags would no longer be necessary. This would significantly reduce the amount of plastic waste generated each year, leading to a cleaner and more sustainable environment.",
    "Plastic products could be made from biodegradable materials: With plastic biodegrading faster, manufacturers could start using biodegradable materials like plant-based plastics or bioplastics. These materials would break down naturally, reducing the amount of plastic waste in the environment.",
    "Plastic recycling would become more efficient: If plastic could biodegrade quickly, recycling facilities could focus on processing more plastic waste, rather than storing it for extended periods. This would lead to a more efficient recycling process, reducing the amount of plastic waste that ends up in landfills.",
    "Microplastics would disappear: Microplastics, which are small plastic particles that enter the environment through various sources, including plastic waste, would break down quickly if plastic could biodegrade as fast as paper. This would significantly reduce the amount of microplastics in the environment, minimizing their impact on marine life and the food chain."
