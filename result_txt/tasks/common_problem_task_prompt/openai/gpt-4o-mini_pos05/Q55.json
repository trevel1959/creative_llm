    "**Funding and Financial Sustainability**: Securing funding for the establishment and ongoing maintenance of a nature conservation park can be a significant challenge. Initial costs may include land acquisition, habitat restoration, and infrastructure development (such as trails and visitor centers). Ongoing expenses may include staff salaries, maintenance, and conservation programs. Problems could arise if funding sources, such as grants or donations, are insufficient or if financial mismanagement occurs, leading to budget shortfalls that jeopardize the park's sustainability.",
    "**Community Engagement and Stakeholder Conflict**: Engaging local communities and stakeholders is crucial for the success of a nature conservation park. Conflicts may arise if local residents feel excluded from decision-making processes or if their land-use practices (such as farming or logging) are threatened by the park's establishment. Building trust and fostering collaboration through workshops, public meetings, and stakeholder committees will be essential to address these issues, but challenges may persist if communication is inadequate or if community interests are not aligned.",
    "**Invasive Species Management**: Invasive species pose a significant threat to the biodiversity of conservation parks. These species can outcompete native flora and fauna, leading to declines in local populations and altered ecosystems. Problems may arise if a robust management plan is not implemented from the outset, as invasive species can quickly establish themselves and become difficult to control. Regular monitoring, removal efforts, and public education campaigns will be necessary to mitigate this issue.",
    "**Visitor Management and Environmental Impact**: While public access to the park is important for education and enjoyment, high visitor numbers can lead to environmental degradation, such as soil erosion, littering, and disturbance to wildlife. Problems may arise if visitor management strategies are not developed, leading to overuse of certain areas and negative impacts on the park's natural resources. Implementing visitor limits, designated trails, and educational programs about responsible behavior in natural spaces will be essential to address these concerns.",
    "**Climate Change Adaptation**: Climate change poses a long-term threat to ecosystems and species within the conservation park. Problems may arise if the park's design and management strategies do not account for changing climate conditions, such as altered rainfall patterns, increased temperatures, and shifting species distributions. Developing a climate adaptation plan that includes habitat restoration, species relocation, and ongoing research will be critical to ensure the park remains resilient to these changes."
