    "**Customizable LED Lights**: Incorporate customizable LED lights into the roller skates that can change colors and patterns based on the skater's movements or music. This feature would not only enhance visibility for safety at night but also allow skaters to express their personal style, creating a fun and dynamic skating experience.",
    "**Modular Design**: Develop roller skates with a modular design that allows users to easily swap out components like wheels, frames, and boots. This would enable skaters to customize their skates for different surfaces (e.g., outdoor vs. indoor) or performance levels, making them versatile for various skating styles and conditions.",
    "**Ergonomic Boot Design**: Redesign the boot with an emphasis on ergonomic support and comfort. Use advanced materials that mold to the skater's foot over time, providing personalized fit and reducing the risk of blisters or discomfort. This would be particularly beneficial for long skating sessions or for those new to the sport.",
    "**Built-in Suspension System**: Introduce a built-in suspension system in the frame of the roller skates to absorb shocks and vibrations from uneven surfaces. This would enhance stability and comfort, making it easier for skaters to maintain balance and control, especially on rough terrain.",
    "**Reflective Safety Features**: Add reflective materials to the skates, especially on the boot and wheels, to increase visibility during low-light conditions. These features could include reflective stripes or patterns that glow when light hits them, making skaters more visible to traffic and pedestrians."
