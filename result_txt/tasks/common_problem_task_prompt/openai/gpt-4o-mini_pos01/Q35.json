    "**Zoonotic Diseases**: Zoos can be breeding grounds for diseases that can transfer from animals to humans. Issues could arise from inadequate health protocols, such as not properly vaccinating animals or failing to implement strict hygiene measures. An outbreak could endanger both staff and visitors, requiring immediate action and possibly leading to a temporary closure of the zoo.",
    "**Financial Sustainability**: Running a zoo can be expensive, with costs for animal care, maintenance, and staffing. Problems may emerge if ticket sales drop due to external factors like economic downturns or public perception. This could result in budget cuts affecting animal care or even the potential for closure. Diversifying income streams through memberships, donations, and special events can help mitigate this risk.",
    "**Staff Training and Retention**: A zoo relies heavily on knowledgeable staff for animal care, education, and visitor engagement. Problems may arise if there is a lack of proper training or high turnover rates, leading to inconsistent care and visitor experiences. Implementing ongoing training programs and fostering a positive work environment can help retain skilled employees.",
    "**Public Safety**: The safety of visitors is crucial. Problems could arise from inadequate safety measures, such as failing to secure enclosures properly or not having sufficient emergency protocols in place. An incident involving an animal escaping or an aggressive encounter could result in injuries and negative publicity. Regular safety drills and thorough inspections of facilities can help prevent such occurrences.",
    "**Environmental Impact**: Zoos can have a significant environmental footprint, from energy consumption to waste management. Problems may arise if the zoo does not implement sustainable practices, leading to negative impacts on local ecosystems. Initiatives such as solar energy, water recycling, and habitat restoration can help reduce the zoo's environmental impact and promote conservation efforts."
