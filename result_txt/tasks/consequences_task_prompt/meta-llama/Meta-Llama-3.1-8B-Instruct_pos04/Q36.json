    "**Revolutionized Prosthetics**: With the ability to regenerate limbs like starfish, the need for traditional prosthetics would significantly decrease. However, the prosthetic industry could adapt by focusing on more advanced, high-tech solutions that integrate with the regenerative process, providing enhanced functionality and comfort for individuals who still require prosthetic assistance. This could lead to a new wave of innovative prosthetic designs and materials.",
    "**New Medical Specializations**: The study of regenerative limbs could give rise to new medical specializations, such as \"Regenerative Limb Surgeons\" or \"Regenerative Wound Specialists.\" These professionals would focus on understanding and treating the complex biological processes involved in limb regeneration, leading to breakthroughs in various medical fields.",
    "**Impact on Disability Rights**: Regenerative limbs could challenge traditional notions of disability and accessibility. Governments and organizations might need to reassess their policies and infrastructure to accommodate individuals who can regenerate limbs, potentially leading to a more inclusive and adaptive society.",
    "**Ethical Considerations**: The ability to regenerate limbs like starfish raises complex ethical questions. For example, would it be morally justifiable to prevent individuals from regenerating limbs for certain conditions, or would this be seen as a form of medical discrimination? The medical community and society at large would need to address these ethical dilemmas.",
    "**Evolutionary Implications**: If humans could regenerate limbs like starfish, it could have significant evolutionary implications. Over time, humans might adapt to their environment in new ways, potentially leading to changes in population dynamics, migration patterns, and even the development of new species. This could raise questions about the role of humans in the natural world and our responsibility to the environment. </s> [/INST] "
