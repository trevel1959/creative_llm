    "**Temperature-Sensitive Spatula**: Create a spatula with a temperature-sensitive material that changes color when it comes into contact with hot surfaces. This feature would help cooks gauge the heat of their pans, reducing the risk of burning food or damaging the spatula itself. It could also serve as a visual cue for when food is adequately cooked.",
    "**Ergonomic Design with Grip Enhancements**: Revamp the spatulaâ€™s handle to include an ergonomic design tailored for comfort during extended use. This could involve a non-slip, cushioned grip that molds to the user's hand. Additionally, the handle could be adjustable in length to accommodate various cooking positions and preferences, making it suitable for both right- and left-handed cooks.",
    "**Smart Spatula with Built-in Timer**: Integrate a digital timer into the spatula's handle that allows users to set cooking times for specific foods. The spatula could emit a gentle beep or vibrate when the set time is reached, ensuring that food is not overcooked. This feature would be particularly useful for recipes that require precise timing.",
    "**Spatula with Removable Head**: Design a spatula with a removable head that can be swapped out for different types, such as a slotted head for draining liquids, a solid head for flipping, or a flexible head for scraping. This modular design would allow users to customize their spatula for various cooking tasks, enhancing versatility in the kitchen.",
    "**Self-Cleaning Spatula**: Innovate a spatula with a self-cleaning feature that utilizes UV light technology to sanitize the spatula's surface after use. This would help eliminate bacteria and food residues, making it safer and more hygienic. The spatula could also have a detachable, dishwasher-safe component for thorough cleaning when needed."
