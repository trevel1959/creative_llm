    "Solar-powered cars: Solar panels could be installed on the roofs of cars to generate electricity to power the vehicle's motor. This would require a significant investment in solar technology and infrastructure, but it would be a clean and renewable source of energy.",
    "Hydrogen fuel cells: Fuel cells could be used to generate electricity from hydrogen, which could be produced from water using renewable energy sources like wind or solar power. This would require significant investment in infrastructure and technology, but it would be a clean and renewable source of energy.",
    "Electric cars: Electric cars could be powered by batteries, which could be charged from renewable energy sources like wind or solar power. This would require significant investment in infrastructure and technology, but it would be a clean and renewable source of energy.",
    "Biodiesel: Biodiesel could be produced from plant-based sources like soybeans or corn, which could be grown using renewable energy sources like wind or solar power. This would require significant investment in infrastructure and technology, but it would be a clean and renewable source of energy.",
    "Nuclear power: Nuclear power could be used to generate electricity to power vehicles. This would require significant investment in infrastructure and technology, but it would be a clean and renewable source of energy. However, it is important to note that nuclear power is a controversial source of energy due to safety concerns and the potential for nuclear accidents."
