    "**Liability and Insurance Challenges**: The question of liability in the event of an accident involving a self-driving car can be complicated. If the car is at fault, is the manufacturer responsible, or is it the owner? This ambiguity could lead to disputes and challenges in insurance claims, requiring new policies and regulations to be developed to address these unique scenarios.",
    "**Dependence on Technology**: Relying on a self-driving car could lead to a decline in driving skills among users. Over time, individuals may become less adept at handling a vehicle manually, which could pose a risk if they ever need to take control of the car in an emergency situation. This dependency could also lead to a lack of situational awareness while traveling.",
    "**Ethical Decision-Making in Crises**: Self-driving cars may encounter situations where they must make ethical decisions, such as choosing between two harmful outcomes in an unavoidable accident. The programming of these decisions raises moral questions about how to prioritize lives, and owners may struggle with the implications of these programmed choices.",
    "**Impact on Traffic and Urban Planning**: The widespread adoption of self-driving cars could alter traffic patterns and urban infrastructure. For example, increased convenience might lead to more cars on the road, exacerbating congestion and pollution. City planners may need to rethink public transportation systems, parking regulations, and road designs to accommodate the new dynamics of self-driving vehicles.",
    "**Accessibility and Inclusivity Issues**: While self-driving cars have the potential to improve mobility for those unable to drive, such as the elderly or disabled, not everyone may have equal access to this technology. Issues may arise related to affordability, availability, and the digital divide, where those without access to technology or resources may be left behind."
