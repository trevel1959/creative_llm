    "A focus on education and learning: Since children are naturally curious and love learning, a child-led world might place great emphasis on education. Schools would be fun and engaging, with interactive lessons and plenty of hands-on activities to spark interest and encourage creativity. However, this could also lead to a lack of discipline and structure, as children often lack the patience and skills necessary to manage a complex curriculum.",
    "An increase in global cooperation: Children are often more open-minded and accepting than adults, and a child-led world might prioritize global cooperation and understanding over nationalism and conflict. This could lead to a more peaceful world with fewer wars and international tensions. However, this could also be challenging to implement, as adults currently in power may be resistant to change and the redistribution of resources.",
    "A focus on sustainability and environmentalism: Children have been raised in an era of increasing environmental concerns, and a child-led world might be particularly focused on preserving and protecting the planet. This could lead to a shift to renewable energy, sustainable agriculture, and conservation efforts. However, this could also be challenging to achieve without the support of adults who currently hold the reins of power and hold different values.",
    "A more empathetic and compassionate world: Children are often more empathetic and compassionate than adults, and a child-led world might prioritize the well-being of individuals over economic growth or profit. This could lead to a more caring and inclusive society, with a focus on social equity and support for those in need. However, this could also be challenging to implement, as adults in power may be more focused on individual achievement and competition.",
    "An increase in creativity and innovation: Children are often more open-minded and willing to take risks than adults, and a child-led world might be particularly focused on innovation and creativity. This could lead to breakthroughs in science, technology, and the arts, as well as new approaches to solving complex problems. However, this could also be challenging to implement, as adults in power may be resistant to change and reluctant to invest in new ideas."
