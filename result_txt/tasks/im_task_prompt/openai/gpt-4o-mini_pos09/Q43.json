    "**Multi-Functional Oven with Modular Components**:    Design an oven that allows users to swap out different cooking modules depending on their needs. For example, one module could be a convection oven, another could be a steamer, and a third could be a dehydrator. This modular design would cater to various cooking styles and preferences, making it a versatile kitchen appliance that adapts to the user's culinary adventures.",
    "**Integrated Air Quality Monitoring**:    Incorporate air quality sensors within the oven that monitor the emissions and odors released during cooking. This feature could alert users when harmful fumes are detected, allowing them to ventilate their kitchen properly. Additionally, the oven could have a built-in air purification system that activates during cooking to maintain a healthy environment.",
    "**Self-Cleaning Technology with Eco-Friendly Solutions**:    Enhance the self-cleaning function of the oven by integrating eco-friendly cleaning solutions that use steam and natural enzymes to break down grease and food residue. This method would be less harmful to the environment compared to traditional chemical cleaners and would eliminate the need for users to manually scrub the oven.",
    "**Augmented Reality (AR) Cooking Guide**:    Create an oven with an integrated AR system that displays step-by-step cooking instructions directly onto the oven's glass door or through a paired AR headset. Users could see visual cues for ingredient quantities, cooking times, and even plating suggestions, making it easier for novice cooks to follow recipes and improve their culinary skills.",
    "**Built-in Recipe Library and Meal Planner**:    Equip the oven with a touchscreen interface that features a built-in recipe library and meal planner. Users could browse through thousands of recipes, create shopping lists, and schedule meal prep directly from the oven. The oven could also suggest recipes based on dietary preferences and restrictions, helping users maintain a balanced diet."
