    "Built-in surfboard wax: Surfboard wax can be improved by integrating it directly into the board's surface. This would not only provide a smoother application experience but also last longer and perform better in cold water.",
    "Surfboard traction pad upgrade: The surface of the surfboard could be upgraded to include a non-slip traction pad, providing better grip and preventing surfers from slipping off the board while riding waves.",
    "Integrated fin system: An integrated fin system could be designed to replace the traditional fins on the bottom of the surfboard. These new fins could be adjustable, allowing surfers to customize their board's performance and maneuverability.",
    "Surfboard storage solution: A compact and durable surfboard storage solution could be designed to keep the board safe and secure when not in use. This would not only be convenient for storage but also help protect the surfboard from damage.",
    "Surfboard lighting system: A surfboard lighting system could be integrated into the board's design, allowing surfers to see the board in low-light conditions and making it more visible to other surfers and swimmers in the water."
