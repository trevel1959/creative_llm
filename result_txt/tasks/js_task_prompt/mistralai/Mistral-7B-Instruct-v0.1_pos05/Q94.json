    "\"Energy of Imagination\": This new energy source would harness the power of human imagination to generate electricity. People would wear devices that track their brainwaves and convert them into usable energy. This could be used to power homes, devices, and even entire cities.",
    "\"Solar-Fusion Energy\": This energy source would use advanced solar panels to harness the power of the sun and combine it with nuclear fusion to create a virtually limitless source of clean energy.",
    "\"Kinetic Energy\": This energy source would capture the motion of objects and convert it into usable electricity. This could be done through the use of special shoes or clothing that generate electricity with every step or movement.",
    "\"Geothermal Energy\": This energy source would use the heat from the Earth's core to generate electricity. This could be done through the use of specialized drills that reach deep into the Earth's crust to tap into the natural heat.",
    "\"Bio-Energy\": This energy source would use the natural metabolic processes of living organisms to generate electricity. This could be done through the use of genetically modified bacteria that produce electricity through their metabolism."
