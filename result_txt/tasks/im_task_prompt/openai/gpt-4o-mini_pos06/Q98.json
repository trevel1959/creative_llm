    "**Self-Cleaning Mechanism**: Incorporate a self-cleaning feature that uses high-pressure steam or a rotating brush system to clean the juicerâ€™s components after each use. This would significantly reduce the time and effort required for cleaning, making the juicer more user-friendly and encouraging more frequent use.",
    "**Modular Juicing System**: Design a modular juicer with interchangeable parts that can be easily swapped out for different functions, such as a citrus juicer, a smoothie blender, or a nut milk maker. This would allow users to customize their juicer based on their specific needs and save space in the kitchen.",
    "**Cold-Press and Heat-Infusion Technology**: Combine cold-press juicing with a heat-infusion option that allows users to create warm, nutrient-rich juices or teas. This would cater to those who enjoy warm beverages, especially in colder climates, and could enhance the extraction of certain flavors and nutrients.",
    "**Sustainable Material Construction**: Create a juicer made entirely from sustainable, biodegradable materials. This could include using bamboo, recycled plastics, or bioplastics. Not only would this appeal to environmentally conscious consumers, but it would also reduce the carbon footprint associated with manufacturing and disposing of traditional juicers.",
    "**Built-in Nutrient Analyzer**: Equip the juicer with a small sensor that analyzes the nutrient content of the juice being produced. This could provide real-time feedback on vitamins, minerals, and other health metrics, helping users make informed decisions about their juice intake and encouraging them to incorporate a wider variety of fruits and vegetables."
