    "**Rainwater Harvesting System**: You could install a rainwater harvesting system on your property. This system collects rainwater from rooftops, filters it through a series of sand, gravel, and charcoal layers to remove impurities, and then stores it in a large tank for later use. Rainwater is naturally cleaner than most surface water sources and can provide a reliable supply of clean drinking water.",
    "**Portable Water Filtration Devices**: Invest in portable water filtration devices such as water purifiers or water filters. These devices are designed to remove contaminants like bacteria, viruses, and chemicals from water. They can be carried around easily, making them useful when traveling or during emergencies.",
    "**Water Purification Tablets**: Use water purification tablets, which contain chemicals that disinfect water by killing harmful microorganisms. These tablets are simple to use, require no electricity, and can be carried in a small container, making them an excellent option for camping, hiking, or emergency situations.",
    "**Solar Distillation**: Set up a solar still, which uses the heat from the sun to evaporate contaminated water. The vapor then condenses on a surface and collects as clean water. This method requires minimal resources and doesn't consume any energy once set up.",
    "**Biological Filtration**: Utilize natural biological processes to clean water. Construct a bioreactor or a constructed wetland system where plants and microorganisms break down pollutants. This method requires some initial setup but can produce clean water sustainably over time without the need for constant intervention or external resources."
