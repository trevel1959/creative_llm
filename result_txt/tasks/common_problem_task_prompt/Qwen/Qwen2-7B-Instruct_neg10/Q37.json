    "**Logistical Challenges**: Moving large, delicate pieces of art can be challenging, especially if the exhibition space is located far from the artists' studios or galleries. Efficient logistics planning, including transportation methods, packaging, and insurance for the items during transit, are crucial to avoid any mishaps.",
    "**Artwork Damage**: During setup, accidents such as scratches, dents, or tears can occur, potentially affecting the value and integrity of the pieces. Implementing careful handling protocols, providing protective materials like bubble wrap or padding, and training staff on proper techniques can mitigate this issue.",
    "**Cultural Sensitivity**: Some artworks might contain themes or symbols that could be offensive or inappropriate in certain cultural contexts. Ensuring the exhibition respects diverse cultural perspectives requires thorough research and consultation with relevant experts or communities.",
    "**Visitor Safety**: Large crowds during peak times could pose risks of overcrowding, tripping hazards, or even stampedes. Managing visitor flow through crowd control measures, setting up clear signage, and having emergency evacuation plans in place is essential.",
    "**Technical Issues**: Displaying art often involves lighting, projection, or interactive elements that require technical expertise. Technical failures, such as faulty equipment or software bugs, can disrupt the viewing experience and potentially damage the artworks. Regular maintenance checks and having backup solutions ready are important precautions."
