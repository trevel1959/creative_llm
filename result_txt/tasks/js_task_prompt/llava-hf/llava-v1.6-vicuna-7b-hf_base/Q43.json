    "Non-Intrusive Surveillance: I would use my ability to see through walls to monitor my neighbors' homes without actually being there. This would allow me to keep an eye on their activities and ensure their safety without making them feel like they are being watched.",
    "Improved Communication: I would use my power to communicate with people inside a room, even if they are on the other side of a wall. This would be especially useful in emergency situations, such as a fire or a natural disaster, where every second counts.",
    "Easier Navigation: With the ability to see through walls, I would no longer need to rely on traditional navigation tools like maps or GPS devices. I could simply look through walls to find my way around unfamiliar areas.",
    "Enhanced Social Interaction: I would use my power to see through walls to connect with people who are on the other side of a wall, even if they are not aware of my presence. This could be a great way to make new friends or to reconnect with old ones.",
    "Increased Productivity: With the ability to see through walls, I could easily monitor multiple rooms at once, allowing me to keep an eye on my children while I work or to keep an eye on my pets while I am away from home."
