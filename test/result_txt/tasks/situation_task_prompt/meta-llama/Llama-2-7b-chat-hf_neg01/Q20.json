    "Magnetic Levitation Train: Without planes, traveling to another continent would be a significant challenge. However, a magnetic levitation train could be an innovative solution. This train would use magnetic fields to lift and propel trains, allowing for faster and more efficient travel. By harnessing the power of magnetic levitation technology, passengers could reach speeds of over 300 mph and travel across continents in a matter of days.",
    "Floating Islands: In a world without planes, floating islands could offer a unique and eco-friendly way to travel. These islands would be constructed using advanced materials and technology, allowing them to float on the ocean's surface. Passengers could travel from one continent to another by hopping from one island to another, enjoying the stunning views of the ocean along the way.",
    "Hydrogen-Powered Submarines: Submarines are already used for underwater exploration, but with no planes, they could become the primary means of intercontinental travel. Hydrogen-powered submarines would be an eco-friendly and efficient option, as they produce zero emissions and have a much lower carbon footprint than traditional submarines. With advanced technology, these submarines could travel at high speeds, making long-distance journeys possible in a relatively short amount of time.",
    "Space Tourism: In a world without planes, space tourism could become the next big thing. With private space companies like SpaceX and Blue Origin leading the charge, space travel is becoming more accessible than ever before. Passengers could travel to the moon or even other planets, experiencing weightlessness and witnessing the breathtaking views of space. While still in its infancy, space tourism has the potential to become a major mode of intercontinental travel in the future.",
    "Advanced Tunnels: Advanced tunnels could revolutionize the way we travel between continents. Using cutting-edge technology, tunnels could be constructed under the ocean or through mountains, allowing for fast and efficient travel. These tunnels could be powered by renewable energy sources, such as solar or wind power, making them both eco-friendly and sustainable. With advanced safety features and comfortable accommodations, traveling through tunnels could become"
