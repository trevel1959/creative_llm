    "Self-Driving Electric Scooters: Design electric scooters that can drive themselves, using advanced sensors and AI to navigate roads and avoid obstacles. These scooters would be equipped with GPS, and users could input their destination. The scooters would be charged at designated charging stations and could be used for short-distance travel within cities.",
    "Magnetic levitation Trains: Create high-speed trains that use magnetic levitation technology to travel at incredible speeds while maintaining stability and comfort. The trains would be powered by electricity and could be connected to a high-speed rail network. The train cars would be designed with smooth surfaces and ergonomic seating for a comfortable ride.",
    "Floating Bicycle Taxis: Develop bicycles that can levitate using a combination of magnets and sensors, allowing them to travel effortlessly through the air. These bicycles would be used for short-distance transportation within cities and could be controlled by a joystick or a remote control. The bicycles would be powered by solar panels and could be charged at designated charging stations.",
    "Solar-Powered Trains: Design trains that run on solar panels, allowing them to travel long distances without the need for traditional fossil fuels. The trains would be equipped with a large array of solar panels and would use energy-efficient batteries to store energy during the day for use at night. The trains would be environmentally friendly and could be used for both passenger and freight transportation.",
    "Vertical Farming High-Rises: Create high-rise buildings that incorporate vertical farming technology, allowing for the cultivation of food in urban environments. The buildings would be equipped with a series of interconnected vertical gardens, where plants could be grown in a controlled environment. The buildings would also house apartments and offices, providing a sustainable and efficient use of space."
