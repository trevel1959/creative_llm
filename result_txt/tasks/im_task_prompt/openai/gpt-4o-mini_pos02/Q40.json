    "**Smart Sunglasses with AR Integration**: Develop sunglasses that incorporate augmented reality (AR) technology. Users could access navigation, notifications, and even fitness tracking directly in their field of vision. With a heads-up display, these sunglasses would enhance outdoor activities, allowing users to see maps, texts, and other information without needing to look at their phones.",
    "**Eco-Friendly Materials**: Design sunglasses using biodegradable or recycled materials to reduce environmental impact. This could include frames made from plant-based plastics or ocean plastics, promoting sustainability. Additionally, an initiative could be launched where for every pair sold, a portion goes towards ocean cleanup efforts.",
    "**Interchangeable Frame and Lens System**: Introduce a modular sunglasses system where users can easily swap out frames and lenses to create a personalized look. This could include a variety of colors, styles, and lens types (polarized, mirrored, etc.). This system would encourage creativity and allow users to adapt their sunglasses to different outfits or occasions.",
    "**Built-in UV and Blue Light Sensors**: Integrate sensors that detect UV radiation and blue light exposure, alerting the wearer when they have been in the sun too long or when they are exposed to harmful blue light from screens. The sunglasses could connect to a smartphone app that tracks exposure levels and offers tips for eye protection.",
    "**Fashion-Forward Customization**: Offer a service where customers can design their own sunglasses online, choosing frame shapes, colors, and lens types. This could include options for engravings or patterns on the frames, appealing to fashion-conscious consumers who want unique accessories that reflect their personal style."
