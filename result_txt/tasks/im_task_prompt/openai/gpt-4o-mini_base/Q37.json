    "**Modular Design with Interchangeable Components**: Create a chair with a modular design that allows users to customize and change components based on their needs. For example, users could swap out the seat cushion for a firmer or softer option, change armrests for different heights, or even add a footrest. This would cater to individual preferences and improve ergonomic support.",
    "**Built-in Fitness Tracker**: Design a chair that encourages movement by incorporating a fitness tracker that monitors sitting time, posture, and even encourages users to stand or stretch at intervals. It could vibrate gently or send notifications to a connected app when it's time to take a break, promoting healthier habits for those who sit for long periods.",
    "**Eco-Friendly Materials and Upcycling**: Focus on sustainability by using eco-friendly materials like recycled plastics or sustainably sourced wood. Additionally, create a program where customers can send back their old chairs for upcycling, turning them into new furniture pieces or components, thus reducing waste and promoting a circular economy.",
    "**Integrated Storage Solutions**: Design chairs with built-in storage compartments for small items like books, tablets, or remote controls. This could be achieved through hidden drawers or pockets in the armrests or under the seat. This functionality would help keep living spaces tidy and organized while providing easy access to frequently used items.",
    "**Adaptive Lumbar Support**: Introduce an innovative lumbar support system that adapts to the user's back shape and movement. Using memory foam or inflatable elements, the chair could adjust dynamically to provide optimal support throughout the day, ensuring comfort and reducing back strain for various activities, from working to relaxing."
