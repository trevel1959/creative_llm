    "In the heart of the Serengeti, there lived a lion named Leo, known for his majestic mane but cursed with a silent roar. Other animals mocked him, believing he lacked the strength of a true king. One fateful day, a wildfire erupted, threatening the savannah. While the other lions fled, Leo stood his ground, using his keen instincts to guide the frightened animals to safety. His bravery spoke louder than any roar. When the danger passed, the animals realized that true leadership isnâ€™t about sound, but about courage and compassion. From that day forward, Leo became the revered protector of the plains.",
