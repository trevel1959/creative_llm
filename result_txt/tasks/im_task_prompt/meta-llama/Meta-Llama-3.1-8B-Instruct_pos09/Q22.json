    "**Lumina Loop**: Design a wearable device that doubles as a flashlight and a stress-relief tool. The device would have a flexible, wrist-worn design with a built-in LED light that can be adjusted to different brightness levels. The twist? The device would also have a built-in tactile feedback system that responds to the user's emotions, providing a calming or energizing sensation through subtle vibrations and temperature changes. This innovative wearable would help individuals manage stress and anxiety while also providing a reliable source of light in low-light environments.",
    "**SolarSphere**: Envision a portable, solar-powered lantern that not only provides light but also serves as a miniature, self-sustaining ecosystem. The lantern would be equipped with a built-in hydroponic system, allowing users to grow their own herbs or microgreens while harnessing the power of the sun. This eco-friendly design would not only provide a sustainable source of light but also promote a connection with nature and encourage users to think creatively about their impact on the environment.",
    "**LuminaLens**: Develop a smart, augmented reality (AR) flashlight that overlays digital information onto the real world. The device would use a high-resolution display and advanced computer vision to detect and highlight specific objects, people, or features in the user's surroundings. This cutting-edge flashlight would be an invaluable tool for professionals, such as emergency responders, maintenance workers, or historians, who need to quickly access information in the field.",
    "**GlowGrid**: Design a modular, grid-based lighting system that can be easily assembled and rearranged to create unique, artistic light installations. Each module would be equipped with a high-intensity LED light and a wireless connectivity system, allowing users to control and synchronize the lights remotely using a mobile app. This innovative lighting system would enable artists, designers, and event planners to create immersive, interactive experiences that engage and inspire audiences.",
    "**AuroraAmp**: Envision a wearable, sound-emitting flashlight that combines light and sound to create an immersive, 3D audio experience. The device would use advanced audio processing algorithms to generate a spatial, 3D sound field that corresponds to the user's surroundings. This revolutionary flashlight would not only provide a reliable source of light but also transport users to new sonic dimensions, making it an essential tool for musicians, sound designers, and anyone looking to enhance their audio experiences.
