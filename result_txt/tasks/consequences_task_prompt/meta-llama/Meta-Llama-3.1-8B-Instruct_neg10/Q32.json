    "**The Great Exchange**: Imagine a world where the dead can communicate with the living, but with a twist. The dead can only share their knowledge and experiences, but they cannot provide any new information or insights. This would lead to a great exchange of information, with the living gaining a deeper understanding of history, science, and the human experience. However, it would also create a sense of stagnation, as the dead would be unable to provide any new ideas or perspectives. This could lead to a culture of nostalgia, where people become overly attached to the past and resist change.",

This would create a culture of seeking guidance and advice, where people become reliant on the dead for answers to their problems. However, it could also lead to a sense of dependence, as people become overly reliant on the dead and lose their own agency and decision-making abilities.
