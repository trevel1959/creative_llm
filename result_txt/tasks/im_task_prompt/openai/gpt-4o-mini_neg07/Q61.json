    "**Mood-Based Scheduling**: Introduce a feature that allows users to input their mood or energy levels for the day. The calendar assistant could then suggest tasks and events that align with the user's current emotional state. For example, if a user feels energized, it might recommend scheduling a workout or a brainstorming session, while on a low-energy day, it could suggest lighter tasks or relaxation periods.",
    "**Integrated Wellness Features**: Incorporate wellness features that remind users to take breaks, hydrate, or practice mindfulness throughout their day. The calendar assistant could integrate with health apps to monitor user activity levels and suggest appropriate wellness breaks or activities, like stretching exercises or guided meditations, to promote overall well-being.",
    "**Augmented Reality (AR) View**: Develop an AR feature that allows users to visualize their schedules in a more immersive way. Users could point their device's camera at their workspace, and the calendar assistant would overlay their upcoming tasks and events in real-time. This could help users manage their time more effectively by providing a visual representation of their commitments.",
    "**Collaborative Planning Hub**: Transform the calendar assistant into a collaborative planning tool where users can invite friends, family, or colleagues to contribute to shared calendars. This feature could allow for real-time updates, collaborative event planning, and even group polls to find the best time for meetings or gatherings, making scheduling more democratic and efficient.",
    "**Voice-Activated Contextual Suggestions**: Implement a voice recognition feature that allows users to ask the calendar assistant questions about their schedules. For example, a user could say, \"What do I have planned for tomorrow?\" or \"Suggest a time for a meeting with John next week.\" The assistant could then provide contextual suggestions based on the userâ€™s calendar, priorities, and even their location, making scheduling more conversational and less cumbersome."
