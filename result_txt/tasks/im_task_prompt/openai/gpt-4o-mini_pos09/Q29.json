    "**Eco-Friendly Electric Mower with Solar Charging**: Design a lawn mower that runs entirely on electricity and incorporates solar panels on its surface. This would allow the mower to recharge while it’s parked outside, reducing reliance on the grid and promoting sustainable energy use. The mower could also feature a battery that stores energy from the solar panels, allowing it to operate even on cloudy days.",
    "**Multi-Function Mower with Attachments**: Create a modular lawn mower that can easily switch between different attachments for various yard tasks. For example, it could have a mowing deck, a leaf collector, and a dethatching rake that can be swapped out depending on the season. This would provide homeowners with a versatile tool that can handle multiple lawn care needs without the need for separate equipment.",
    "**Self-Cleaning Lawn Mower**: Innovate a lawn mower that features a self-cleaning mechanism, utilizing a series of rotating brushes and water jets that activate after each mowing session. This would help to remove grass clippings and debris from the blades and undercarriage, reducing the need for manual cleaning and maintaining optimal performance.",
    "**Ergonomic Design with Adjustable Height and Handles**: Revamp the lawn mower's design to include adjustable handle heights and ergonomic grips that reduce strain on the user’s back and arms. Incorporating a lightweight frame and larger wheels could also make it easier to maneuver across various terrains, making lawn care more accessible for people of all ages and physical abilities.",
    "**Noise-Canceling Technology**: Integrate noise-canceling technology into the lawn mower to significantly reduce the sound it produces while in operation. This could involve using sound-dampening materials and engineering the motor to operate at lower decibel levels. This improvement would allow homeowners to mow their lawns at any time without disturbing their neighbors or wildlife."
