    "Create a virtual reality newsroom: If all televisions disappeared, we could create a virtual reality newsroom where people could log in and access real-time news updates. This would be an immersive experience that would allow people to feel like they are in the middle of the action.",
    "Develop a mobile app: Another option would be to develop a mobile app that people could use to access news updates. This app could be designed to push notifications to users whenever there is breaking news, so they never miss an important update.",

    "Create a social media platform: We could create a social media platform that is specifically dedicated to news updates. This platform could be designed to be easy to use and would allow people to follow their favorite news sources and stay up-to-date on the latest developments.",
    "Host a live streaming event: Finally, we could host a live streaming event that provides news updates in real-time. This would be a great way for people to stay informed and engaged with the news, and could be done in partnership with major news networks to ensure that people have access to the most accurate and up-to-date information."
