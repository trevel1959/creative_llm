    "**Evolving Democracy**: This form of government would adapt to societal changes, incorporating new technologies and feedback mechanisms to ensure governance remains relevant. For example, it could include an AI system that analyzes public sentiment and adjusts policies accordingly. This system would be designed to be transparent, allowing citizens to understand how decisions are made and contributing to their creation.",
    "**Sustainable Federation**: A government structure that prioritizes environmental sustainability, with regional or local governments responsible for managing natural resources and ecosystems within their boundaries. Each region would have its own sustainable development plan tailored to its specific environment and resources, with a central government ensuring cooperation and fair distribution of resources across regions.",
    "**Participatory Autocracy**: A blend of autocratic leadership with strong participation from the populace. The head of state would have significant decision-making power but would be elected and required to regularly consult with a democratically elected council that represents different segments of society. This ensures that while the government is efficient, it also maintains democratic values.",
    "**Temporal Governance**: This government structure would change its form over time based on the current era's needs. For instance, during times of rapid technological advancement, the government might focus more on innovation and education. Conversely, in times of economic crisis, the focus might shift towards stability and fiscal management. The system would rely on a panel of experts and representatives to determine the most appropriate form of governance for each period.",
    "**Cosmopolitan Democracy**: A global government structure where citizens from all countries can participate in the decision-making process. This could be achieved through a digital platform that allows citizens to vote on issues affecting the global community, with representatives from various nations making final decisions. The system would ensure cultural representation and equity, allowing smaller nations to have a voice equivalent to larger ones in certain decisions."
