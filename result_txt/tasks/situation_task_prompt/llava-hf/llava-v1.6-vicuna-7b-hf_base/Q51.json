    "Use a raft or canoe: If the river is shallow enough, a raft or canoe could be used to transport people across the river. This would require some level of skill in maneuvering the raft or canoe, but it could be a viable option in certain circumstances.",
    "Build a makeshift bridge: If the collapse of the bridges was unexpected, it might be possible to quickly construct a makeshift bridge using available materials. This could be done using natural materials such as trees, rocks, or even sandbags.",
    "Use a rope or cable system: A rope or cable system could be used to create a makeshift bridge. This would require a sturdy anchor point on one side of the river and a pulley system on the other. People could then be lowered across the river using a rope or cable system.",
    "Climb or climb down: If the river is relatively shallow and the banks are steep, it might be possible to climb down to the river level and then cross. This would require strong physical fitness and a good sense of balance, but it could be a viable option in some cases.",
    "Use a tire or inner tube: A large tire or inner tube could be inflated and used to create a makeshift raft-like structure that could be used to transport people across the river. This would require some level of skill in maneuvering the inflatable, but it could be a viable option in certain circumstances."
