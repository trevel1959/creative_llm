    "**Enhanced Sensory Perception Systems**: The disappearance of glasses and contact lenses could lead to the development of advanced technology that enhances other senses. For instance, wearable devices could translate visual information into auditory or haptic signals. This could be a sophisticated vest equipped with tiny microphones that pick up ambient sounds, then process and relay this information through vibrations or audio cues, helping individuals interpret their surroundings in real-time.",
    "**Augmented Reality Aids**: With glasses and contacts out of the picture, the use of augmented reality (AR) could increase significantly. AR glasses could project visual cues directly onto the user's field of view, compensating for visual impairments. These could include overlays indicating distances, warning of potential obstacles, or even displaying text-to-speech for reading purposes.",
    "**Immersive Virtual Environments**: People might turn to virtual reality (VR) environments to cope with poor vision. VR could provide an immersive experience where the user can navigate virtual spaces without physical constraints. They could customize their environment to suit their needs, such as increasing text sizes or adjusting lighting conditions, which could make tasks like reading and navigating more manageable.",
    "**Improved Lighting and Contrast Techniques**: Without glasses or contacts, individuals might focus on improving the natural environment around them. This could involve the use of high-quality lighting fixtures that adjust to varying light conditions, ensuring better visibility. Additionally, they might adopt techniques like using high-contrast colors in their living and work spaces, which could help them perceive details more clearly.",
    "**Community and Social Support Systems**: The absence of glasses and contacts might lead to a greater reliance on community support. Organizations could be established to provide guidance, resources, and training for coping with vision loss. These could include regular workshops, peer support groups, and online forums where individuals share strategies, tips, and resources for managing daily activities effectively."
