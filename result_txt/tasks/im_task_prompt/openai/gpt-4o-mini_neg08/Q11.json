    "**Self-Cleaning Technology**: Incorporate UV-C light technology into the cap of the water bottle that activates at the press of a button. This feature would eliminate 99.9% of bacteria and viruses inside the bottle, ensuring that users always drink from a clean surface. This would be particularly useful for those who often refill their bottles at public water sources.",
    "**Collapsible Design with Insulation**: Create a collapsible water bottle that can shrink down to a smaller size when empty, making it easier to carry around. This bottle would also have double-wall vacuum insulation to keep drinks cold for up to 24 hours or hot for up to 12 hours, combining convenience with functionality for outdoor enthusiasts and commuters alike.",
    "**Flavor Infuser Chamber**: Design a water bottle with a built-in infuser chamber that allows users to add fruits, herbs, or teas to flavor their water naturally. The infuser could have a detachable design for easy cleaning, and the bottle could include measurement markers to help users gauge how much flavoring they are adding, promoting healthier hydration habits.",
    "**Eco-Friendly Materials with Plantable Seed Cap**: Construct the water bottle from biodegradable materials, and design the cap to contain seeds of native plants. Once the bottle reaches the end of its life, users can plant the cap in soil, promoting sustainability and encouraging a connection with nature. This innovative approach could also raise awareness about environmental issues.",
    "**Interactive LED Display**: Equip the water bottle with an LED display that can show motivational messages, hydration reminders, or even the temperature of the liquid inside. Users could customize the messages via a connected app, and the display could change colors based on the temperature (e.g., blue for cold, red for hot), adding a fun and interactive element to hydration."
