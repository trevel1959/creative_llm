    "Solar-Powered Batteries: Develop a new type of battery that harnesses the power of the sun to generate electricity. These solar-powered batteries could be charged during the day and provide power to devices at night or during periods of low sunlight.",
    "Bio-Batteries: Create a battery that uses living organisms as the energy source. For example, bacteria could be used to break down organic matter and produce electricity. This would provide a sustainable and renewable source of energy.",
    "Magnetic Levitation Batteries: Develop a battery that uses magnetic levitation to generate electricity. This would involve using magnetic fields to suspend a conductive material in mid-air, allowing it to generate electricity through the movement of charged particles.",
    "Thermal Energy Batteries: Create a battery that harnesses the heat from the environment to generate electricity. This could involve using a thermoelectric material to convert heat into electricity, or using a phase change material to store heat energy and release it as electricity when needed.",
    "Hydrogen Fuel Cell Batteries: Develop a battery that uses hydrogen as the energy source. Hydrogen could be used to generate electricity through a fuel cell, providing a clean and efficient source of power. This would involve using a special membrane to separate the hydrogen and oxygen, allowing the hydrogen to be used as a fuel source."
