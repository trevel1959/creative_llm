    "**AI-Driven Content Curator**: Integrate an AI-driven assistant that learns user preferences over time and curates personalized content recommendations. This assistant could analyze viewing habits, genres, and even emotional reactions (using facial recognition) to suggest shows, movies, or documentaries that align with the viewer's mood and interests, making it easier for users to discover new content theyâ€™ll love.",
    "**Mood-Responsive Ambient Lighting**: Incorporate smart ambient lighting that adjusts according to the content being viewed. For instance, if a horror movie is playing, the lights could dim and shift to darker hues, while a romantic comedy might trigger softer, warmer lighting. This feature would enhance the viewing experience by creating a more immersive atmosphere that complements the on-screen action.",
    "**Modular Screen Technology**: Design televisions with modular screens that can be expanded or contracted based on the viewing environment. Users could attach or detach additional panels to create a larger screen for movie nights or revert to a smaller size for casual viewing. This flexibility would allow for better space utilization in homes, adapting to different occasions and room sizes.",
    "**Integrated Fitness Programs**: Incorporate fitness programs directly into the television, allowing users to participate in guided workouts or yoga sessions right from their living rooms. The TV could connect with fitness wearables to track progress, provide real-time feedback, and suggest routines based on user goals. This feature would encourage a healthier lifestyle while making exercise more accessible and enjoyable.",
    "**Social Viewing Experience**: Create a platform that allows friends and family to watch shows or movies together in a virtual environment, regardless of their physical location. Users could create a virtual room where they can chat, react, and even see each other's reactions in real-time, similar to a watch party. This would strengthen social connections and make long-distance relationships feel closer through shared experiences."
