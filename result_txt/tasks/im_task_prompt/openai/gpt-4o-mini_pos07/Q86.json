    "**Adaptive Seating Technology**:    Design wheelchairs with adaptive seating that automatically adjusts to the user's posture and pressure points. Using smart materials and sensors, the seat could change shape, firmness, and temperature based on the user's needs, providing enhanced comfort and reducing the risk of pressure sores during long periods of sitting.",
    "**Integrated Fitness Tracker**:    Incorporate a fitness tracking system into the wheelchair that monitors the user's physical activity, heart rate, and calories burned. This data could be synced with a mobile app, encouraging users to engage in physical activities and providing insights into their health. It could also include reminders for movement or stretching exercises to promote overall well-being.",
    "**Modular Design for Customization**:    Create a modular wheelchair design that allows users to easily swap out components based on their specific needs or preferences. For example, users could change the armrests, footrests, or wheels depending on their daily activities, such as sports, outdoor adventures, or formal events. This customization would empower users to personalize their mobility experience.",
    "**Solar-Powered Battery System**:    Develop a solar-powered wheelchair that incorporates solar panels on the frame to charge the battery while in use or parked outdoors. This eco-friendly feature would reduce reliance on traditional charging methods and extend the wheelchair's operational time, making it particularly beneficial for users who spend a lot of time outside.",
    "**Virtual Reality (VR) Integration**:    Create a VR system that can be integrated with the wheelchair, allowing users to experience virtual environments while remaining in their chair. This could be used for therapeutic purposes, such as exposure therapy for anxiety or rehabilitation exercises, or simply for entertainment, providing an immersive experience that can help alleviate boredom and enhance mental well-being."
