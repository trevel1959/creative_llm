    "**Fog Nets**: In areas where fog is prevalent, large mesh nets can be installed to capture tiny water droplets from the fog. As the wind blows, the droplets collect on the nets and trickle down into collection troughs. This method has been successfully implemented in regions like Chile and Morocco, where fog is abundant but rain is scarce. Fog nets are a low-tech, cost-effective solution for water collection.",
    "**Dew Collection Systems**: By setting up specially designed surfaces that cool down overnight, dew can be collected as it forms. These surfaces could be made of materials with high thermal conductivity, which cool quickly during the night. As dew forms, it condenses on the surface and can be directed into collection containers. This method is particularly useful in arid regions where nighttime temperatures drop significantly.",
    "**Water-Collecting Trees**: Genetic engineering could create trees specifically designed to maximize water collection. These trees would have leaves that can capture moisture from the air and funnel it down to the roots or a reservoir. The roots could then absorb the collected water, which could be tapped by surrounding communities. This method not only provides water but also contributes to reforestation and biodiversity.",
    "**Solar-Powered Desalination Units**: In coastal areas, solar-powered desalination units could be used to convert seawater into freshwater. These units use solar energy to heat seawater, creating steam that can be condensed into pure water. This method provides a sustainable way to access freshwater, especially in regions where rainfall is non-existent, and can be scaled to meet the needs of local communities.",
    "**Hydrogel Water Harvesters**: Hydrogel materials can absorb moisture from the air and release it when needed. By creating large sheets or containers filled with hydrogel, water can be harvested from the atmosphere even in dry conditions. The hydrogels can be engineered to release water gradually, making them an efficient source of water for agriculture and drinking purposes."
