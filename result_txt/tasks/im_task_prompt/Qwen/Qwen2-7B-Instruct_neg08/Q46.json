    "**Adjustable Blade Length:** Design the scissors with adjustable blades that can be extended or shortened by pressing a button. This feature would enable users to customize the sharpness and cutting capacity according to their needs or preferences, from precise crafting tasks to heavier-duty cutting.",
    "**Wire Cutting Feature:** Integrate a wire-cutting notch into the tip of the scissors. This would make it easier for users to cut through various wires without damaging the tool itself, eliminating the need for additional wire-cutting pliers.",
    "**Built-in LED Light:** Incorporate an LED light inside the scissors, activated by a button on the handle. This would provide better visibility when cutting in low-light conditions, such as crafting, sewing, or working with small objects.",
    "**Self-Sharpening Blades:** Implement a micro-sharpener inside the handles that automatically sharpens the blades after each use. This ensures the scissors remain sharp without requiring manual sharpening, saving time and effort.",
    "**Temperature-Resistant Material:** Use heat-resistant materials for the blades, allowing the scissors to be used for cutting through materials that might melt with standard scissors, such as wax paper or some types of plastic."
