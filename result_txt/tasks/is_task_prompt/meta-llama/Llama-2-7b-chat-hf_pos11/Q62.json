    "Create a virtual reality game where players take on the role of a starfish and must navigate through different environments, such as coral reefs, rocky shores, and sandy beaches. The game would challenge players to overcome obstacles and reach their goals, all while learning about the unique abilities of starfish.",
    "Develop a line of eco-friendly starfish-shaped products, such as tote bags, water bottles, and t-shirts. Each product would feature a different species of starfish and would raise awareness about the importance of marine conservation.",
    "Host a starfish-themed art competition where participants create artwork inspired by the beauty and diversity of starfish. The competition would culminate in an exhibit featuring the top pieces, which would be displayed in a local gallery.",
    "Create a mobile app that allows users to identify different species of starfish through a virtual guide. The app would feature high-quality images and information about each species, including their habitat, diet, and conservation status.",
    "Organize a community clean-up event where volunteers work together to remove trash and debris from local beaches and waterways. The event would culminate in a celebration of the importance of marine conservation and the role that individuals can play in protecting the ocean's ecosystem."
