    "**Smart Spatula with Temperature Sensor**: Develop a spatula that includes a temperature sensor embedded in the spatula head. It could connect to a smartphone app via Bluetooth, providing real-time temperature readings of the food being cooked. This would help home cooks achieve perfect doneness for meats and delicate dishes without guesswork.",
    "**Flexible Spatula with Adjustable Head**: Create a spatula with a flexible head that can be adjusted to different angles or shapes. This would allow for better access to corners of pans and bowls, making it easier to scrape, flip, or serve food. The head could lock into place at various angles, providing versatility for different cooking tasks.",
    "**Self-Cleaning Spatula**: Innovate a spatula made from materials that are self-cleaning or include a built-in cleaning mechanism. For example, the spatula could have a detachable head that can be rinsed with water or even include a small reservoir for soap that releases a cleaning solution when pressed, making cleanup easier after cooking.",
    "**Color-Changing Heat Indicator Spatula**: Design a spatula that changes color based on the temperature of the food being cooked. This could help prevent burning and overcooking by providing a visual cue when the food reaches certain temperatures. The color changes could be calibrated for different types of food, ensuring optimal cooking results.",
    "**Ergonomic Grip Spatula with Comfort Features**: Create a spatula with an ergonomic handle designed for comfort and ease of use. This could include a soft-touch grip, contouring to fit the hand better, and even a thumb rest for added control. The handle could also be designed with a slight curve to allow for a more natural wrist position, reducing strain during extended cooking sessions."
