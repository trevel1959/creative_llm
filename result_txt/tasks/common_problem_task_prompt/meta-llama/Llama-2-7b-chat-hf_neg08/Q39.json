    "Financial Sustainability: UBI requires significant funding, which may be challenging to secure, especially in countries with already-strained social welfare systems. If the financial burden of UBI cannot be sustained, it may not be able to be implemented or maintained in the long term.",
    "Inefficient Distribution: If the distribution of UBI is not well-designed, it may not reach those who need it most, such as low-income individuals and families. This could lead to a lack of trust in the system and decreased support for UBI.",
    "Work Disincentives: Some critics argue that UBI could reduce the incentive to work, as individuals may choose to rely on the government stipend rather than seeking employment. This could lead to a decrease in productivity and economic growth.",
    "Social Stigma: UBI may be met with resistance or stigma, particularly if it is perceived as a handout or if recipients are seen as undeserving. This could lead to social isolation or discrimination against UBI recipients.",
    "Monetary Policy Implications: UBI may have unintended consequences on monetary policy, such as inflation or devaluation of currency. Central banks may struggle to manage these risks, which could impact the overall effectiveness of UBI."
