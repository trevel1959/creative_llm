    "**Self-Cleaning Mechanism**:    Introduce a self-cleaning feature that uses ultrasonic waves to break down mineral deposits and impurities within the kettle. This could involve a special cleaning cycle activated by a button or through the smartphone app. The kettle would emit high-frequency sound waves that vibrate the interior surfaces, effectively dislodging any buildup without the need for harsh chemicals, making maintenance easier and promoting better hygiene.",
    "**Integrated Infuser for Herbal Teas**:    Design the kettle with a built-in infuser compartment that allows users to steep loose-leaf teas or herbal blends directly in the kettle. Users could add their ingredients, and the kettle would automatically brew them at the optimal temperature and time. Once finished, the infuser could be easily removed for cleaning. This feature would streamline the tea-making process and ensure that flavors are maximized.",
    "**Energy-Efficient Insulation and Heat Retention**:    Enhance the kettle's design with advanced insulation materials that maintain the temperature of the water for an extended period, reducing energy consumption. Users could pour from the kettle even hours later without needing to reboil, making it ideal for busy households. This could also be coupled with a temperature display that shows the current water temperature, allowing users to pour at their desired warmth.",
    "**Interactive LED Display with Recipe Suggestions**:    Incorporate an interactive LED display on the kettle that not only shows the current temperature but also suggests recipes based on the type of beverage being prepared. For instance, if the kettle detects that water is being boiled for tea, it could display recipes for different tea blends or even suggest food pairings. This feature could be enhanced with voice activation, allowing users to ask for suggestions hands-free.",
    "**Modular Design for Multi-Functionality**:    Create a modular electric kettle that can transform into different appliances. For instance, the kettle could have detachable components that allow it to serve as a steamer, a soup maker, or even a small slow cooker. This would provide users with versatility in the kitchen, reducing the need for multiple appliances and saving counter space."
