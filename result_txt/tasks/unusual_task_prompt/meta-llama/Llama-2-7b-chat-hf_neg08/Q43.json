    "A Bike-Powered Office: Inspired by your jealousy of others' efficiency, you create a bike-powered office where employees can pedal their way to productivity. The bikes are integrated into the office design, with stationary bikes placed near each desk. As employees pedal, they generate electricity that powers their computers, lights, and other office equipment. The bike-powered office not only promotes a healthy work-life balance but also reduces the office's carbon footprint.",
    "Pedal-Powered Task Management: You invent a system where employees can assign tasks to each other using a pedal-powered task management system. Employees can pedal a stationary bike to \"spin\" a wheel of fortune, which determines the task they must complete. The more they pedal, the easier the task becomes. This fun and interactive system encourages collaboration and teamwork while promoting a healthy work environment.",
    "Bicycle-Themed Team Building: To help employees overcome their jealousy, you organize a bicycle-themed team building event. Employees are divided into teams and given a series of bicycle-related challenges, such as a bike scavenger hunt or a bicycle obstacle course. These challenges promote teamwork, problem-solving, and communication while providing a fun and engaging experience.",
    "Bike-Friendly Work Perks: To show your support for employees who use bicycles as their primary mode of transportation, you offer a range of bike-friendly work perks. These include secure bike storage, shower facilities, and on-site bike maintenance services. By creating a bike-friendly work environment, you encourage employees to prioritize their health and well-being while also reducing their carbon footprint.",
    "Bike-Powered Virtual Meetings: To help employees stay connected and productive while working remotely, you invent a bike-powered virtual meeting system. Employees can pedal their bikes to generate electricity, which powers a virtual meeting platform. This innovative system allows employees to participate in virtual meetings from anywhere, promoting collaboration and communication while reducing the need for travel."
