    "**Modular Helmet Design**: Create a helmet with interchangeable parts that allow users to customize their helmet based on riding conditions or personal style. For example, riders could switch out the outer shell for a more aerodynamic design for racing or a more robust one for mountain biking. The interior padding could also be changed to provide different levels of comfort or ventilation.",
    "**Built-in Air Purification System**: Design a helmet that incorporates a small air filtration system. As riders cycle through urban areas with pollution, the helmet could purify the air around the wearer, providing cleaner air to breathe. This could be achieved through a combination of HEPA filters and a small fan system, making urban biking healthier.",
    "**Impact-Resistant Smart Material**: Develop a helmet made from a new class of smart materials that can change its properties upon impact. For instance, the helmet could be soft and flexible during regular use but harden instantly upon collision to provide better protection. This could be achieved through materials that utilize non-Newtonian fluids or advanced polymers.",
    "**Integrated Communication System**: Incorporate a Bluetooth communication system within the helmet, allowing riders to connect with each other or receive calls without needing to stop. This system could include bone conduction speakers, which transmit sound through the skull, ensuring that riders remain aware of their surroundings while still being able to communicate.",
    "**Helmet with Built-in LED Safety Lights**: Enhance visibility with a helmet that features built-in LED lights on the front, back, and sides. These lights could be programmed to flash or change colors based on the rider's speed or the time of day, improving visibility during night rides. The helmet could also include turn signal indicators that activate with a simple hand gesture or button press."
