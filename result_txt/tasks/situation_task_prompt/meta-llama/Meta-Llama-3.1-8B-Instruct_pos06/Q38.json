    "**Water-Based Cleaning**: Develop a system where water is used as the primary cleaning agent. This can be achieved by using natural soap-free cleansers, such as soap nuts or soap bark, which are rich in saponins. These natural cleansers can be used to create a variety of cleaning solutions, from gentle hand soaps to powerful all-purpose cleaners. Additionally, water can be used for washing clothes, dishes, and other household items. This approach would require a significant shift in how we think about cleaning and hygiene, but it's a feasible alternative to traditional soap-based products. **Confidence Score: 0.9**",
    "**Charcoal-Based Filtration**: Utilize activated charcoal as a primary means of filtration and purification. Charcoal has natural adsorption properties, making it an effective tool for removing impurities and contaminants from water, air, and surfaces. This method can be used to create a range of products, from water filters to air purifiers. Charcoal can also be used to absorb and neutralize odors, making it a useful tool for maintaining hygiene in personal and public spaces. **Confidence Score: 0.8**",
    "**Vinegar-Based Sanitizers**: Leverage the antimicrobial properties of vinegar to create a range of sanitizing products. Vinegar can be used to create disinfecting solutions for surfaces, as well as for washing clothes and dishes. Its acidity also makes it an effective tool for removing stubborn stains and odors. This approach would require a significant shift in how we think about cleaning and hygiene, but it's a feasible alternative to traditional soap-based products. **Confidence Score: 0.85**",
    "**Baking Soda-Based Scrubbers**: Develop a system where baking soda is used as a primary scrubbing agent. Baking soda's abrasive properties make it an effective tool for removing dirt, grime, and stains from surfaces. It can also be used to create a range of cleaning products, from gentle hand soaps to powerful all-purpose cleaners. Additionally, baking soda can be used to neutralize odors and absorb moisture, making it a useful tool for maintaining hygiene in personal and public spaces. **Confidence Score: 0.9**",
    "**UV-Based Disinfection**: Utilize ultraviolet (UV) light as a primary means of disinfection. UV light has natural antimicrobial properties, making it an effective tool for killing bacteria, viruses, and other microorganisms. This method can be used"
