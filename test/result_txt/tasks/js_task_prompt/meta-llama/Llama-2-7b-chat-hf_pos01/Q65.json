    "The first idea for a new form of life is a \"Glowing Forest.\" These organisms would resemble trees but have the ability to produce bioluminescent light. This light could be used for communication, attracting pollinators, or defending against predators. Confidence score: 0.8",
    "The second idea is a \"Water-Breathing Organism.\" This new life form would be able to survive in both water and air environments, allowing it to move between different ecosystems with ease. It could also have the ability to absorb nutrients from both water and air, making it a highly adaptable organism. Confidence score: 0.9",
    "The third idea is a \"Shape-Shifting Organism.\" This life form would have the ability to change its physical form in response to its environment, allowing it to adapt to different situations. For example, it could flatten itself to move through narrow spaces or change its shape to blend in with its surroundings. Confidence score: 0.8",
    "The fourth idea is a \"Solar-Powered Organism.\" This new life form would be able to harness the energy of the sun to power its movements and functions. It could also have the ability to store energy from the sun for use when needed, making it a highly efficient and sustainable organism. Confidence score: 0.9",
    "The fifth and final idea is a \"Self-Healing Organism.\" This life form would have the ability to repair and regenerate its own tissues and organs, making it virtually indestructible. It could also have the ability to transfer healing energy to other organisms, making it a valuable member of any ecosystem. Confidence score: 0.9"
