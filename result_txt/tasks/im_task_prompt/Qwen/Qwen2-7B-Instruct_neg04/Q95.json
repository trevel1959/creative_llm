    "**Smart Laundry Basket**: Create a smart laundry basket that connects to a mobile app or home automation system. The basket could have sensors that detect when it's full, sending an alert to the user's phone so they don't forget about dirty clothes piling up. Additionally, it can suggest how many loads of laundry need to be done based on the number of clothes inside, optimizing the use of water and detergent.",
    "**Biodegradable Laundry Basket**: Design a laundry basket made from biodegradable materials like bamboo or cornstarch. This environmentally-friendly option would not only help reduce waste but also make the laundry process more sustainable. It could be marketed towards eco-conscious consumers who prioritize green products in their daily lives.",
    "**Portable Laundry Basket with Storage**: Develop a foldable, lightweight laundry basket that doubles as a storage container. This innovative design would be perfect for travelers or those with limited space at home. The basket could feature multiple compartments for sorting clothes by color or type, making it easier to manage laundry while on-the-go.",
    "**Heated Laundry Basket**: In寒冷 regions, a heated laundry basket could be designed to prevent frozen clothes. Equipped with heating elements, the basket would keep clothes warm until they're ready to be washed, potentially saving energy and preventing damage to delicate fabrics during cold weather.",
    "**Wearable Laundry Basket**: Introduce a wearable laundry basket that integrates into clothing. This idea could take the form of a belt, backpack, or even a vest that collects laundry while the user moves around. It would be particularly useful for busy individuals who don't have time to stop and collect laundry manually, allowing them to gather clothes as they go about their day."
