    "Time Travel Clock: Create a clock that allows the user to travel back in time with each passing minute. The clock could have a dial that rotates in reverse, and as it does, the user is transported back in time. For example, if the dial is set to 5 minutes back, the user would be transported 5 minutes into the past.",
    "Memory Restoration Clock: Design a clock that restores lost memories with each passing minute. The clock could have a series of buttons or dials that the user can press or rotate to access different memories. As the user interacts with the clock, the memories are restored and become more vivid.",
    "Reverse Aging Clock: Create a clock that reverses the aging process. As the minutes pass, the user appears to age less and less, with wrinkles and gray hair disappearing. The clock could have a built-in camera that captures the user's image before and after each minute, showing the transformation.",
    "Day Reversal Clock: Design a clock that reverses the order of the day. As the minutes pass, the clock reverses the order of the day, so that the morning comes before the night, and the sun rises before it sets. The clock could have a display that shows the reversed day, with the hours and minutes reversed.",
    "Time Loop Clock: Create a clock that creates a time loop, where the user relives the same minute over and over again. The clock could have a button that the user can press to enter the time loop, and a display that shows the current time and the number of times the user has relived the same minute. As the user relives the same minute, they can try different actions and see how they affect the outcome."
