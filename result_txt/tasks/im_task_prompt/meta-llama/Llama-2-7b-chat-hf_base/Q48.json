    "Piano-themed escape room: Create an immersive experience where participants are trapped in a room with a grand piano. They must solve puzzles and clues related to the piano and music theory to escape. For example, they might have to play a specific chord progression to unlock a door or figure out the hidden meaning behind a cryptic message etched on the piano's keys.",
    "Piano-powered robotics: Develop a robot that can be controlled using piano keys. Participants can program the robot's movements and actions by playing specific chords or melodies on the piano. This can be used for educational purposes, such as teaching music and robotics concepts to children, or for artistic expression, such as creating choreographed dance routines with the robot.",
    "Piano-inspired fashion: Design a clothing line that incorporates elements of the piano into the designs. For example, a dress could have a pattern of piano keys on the fabric, or a jacket could have a built-in music stand that doubles as a shoulder piece. The clothing line could be marketed towards musicians and music lovers, and could be shown off at a runway show with a piano performance.",
    "Piano-themed video game: Create a video game where players control a character that must navigate through a virtual world using piano keys. The game could be designed for different skill levels, with more complex melodies and chords requiring more advanced techniques. Players could compete with each other or work together to complete levels, with a leaderboard tracking their progress.",
    "Piano-based meditation: Develop a meditation practice that incorporates the piano as a tool for relaxation and mindfulness. Participants can listen to calming piano music while following a guided meditation, or they can play the piano themselves to create a soothing atmosphere. This could be offered as a class or workshop, with a focus on the therapeutic benefits of music and meditation."
