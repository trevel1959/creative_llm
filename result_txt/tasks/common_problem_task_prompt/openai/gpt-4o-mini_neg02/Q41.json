    "**Radiation Exposure**: Spacecraft are exposed to high levels of cosmic radiation, which can pose significant health risks to astronauts. A creative solution would be to design the spaceship with radiation-shielding materials that can be deployed when in high-radiation areas, such as during solar flares. This could include movable panels or a protective “safety cocoon” that envelops the crew area during periods of increased radiation.",
    "**Psychological Stress**: The isolation and confinement of space travel can lead to psychological issues among crew members. To address this, the spaceship could include a dedicated \"wellness zone\" that features relaxation spaces, virtual reality experiences, and interactive entertainment systems. Regular psychological check-ins and group activities could also be incorporated to foster teamwork and mental well-being.",
    "**Communication Delays**: Long-distance space missions may encounter significant communication delays, which can hinder coordination and emergency response. To counter this, the spaceship could be equipped with an AI-based communication system that allows for asynchronous communication, enabling crew members to send messages and receive responses without needing real-time interaction. This system could also provide automated updates on critical systems and alerts.",
    "**Fuel and Resource Management**: Efficient fuel and resource management is essential for long-duration missions. One innovative approach would be to implement a closed-loop system that recycles water and waste into usable resources. The spaceship could also be designed with modular fuel cells that can be replenished or replaced in orbit, reducing the need for heavy fuel loads at launch.",
    "**Microgravity Effects on Health**: Prolonged exposure to microgravity can lead to muscle atrophy and bone density loss. To combat this, the spaceship could feature a gym with advanced exercise equipment that simulates gravity through resistance or centrifugal force. Additionally, nutritionists could develop meal plans that focus on maintaining muscle and bone health, incorporating supplements as needed."
