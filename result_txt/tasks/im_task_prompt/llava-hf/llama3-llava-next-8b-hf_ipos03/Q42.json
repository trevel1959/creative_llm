    "GPS Tracking: Equip the suitcase with a GPS tracking device that can be monitored through a mobile app. This would allow users to locate their luggage in real-time, especially in crowded airports or busy cities, reducing the risk of theft or loss.",
    "Expandable Storage: Design the suitcase with expandable compartments, allowing users to increase or decrease storage space as needed. This would be particularly useful for travelers who need to pack more items for extended trips or who want to maximize their luggage's capacity.",
    "Smart Weight Scale: Incorporate a built-in weight scale into the suitcase, allowing users to easily monitor their luggage's weight without the need for a separate scale. This would be especially helpful for those who need to adhere to airline weight limits.",
    "Travel App Integration: Develop a companion app that allows users to track their luggage's location, monitor their flight status, and access important travel documents. The app could also provide suggestions for local attractions, dining, and transportation based on the user's travel itinerary.",
    "Solar Charging: Equip the suitcase with solar panels that can be used to charge electronic devices, such as smartphones or tablets, during long flights or outdoor adventures. This would be a practical and eco-friendly feature for travelers who need to keep their devices charged on the go."
