    "**Establishing a Truthful Society**: You could create a system where individuals are required to tell the truth in certain situations or for specific purposes, like in legal proceedings, educational exams, or personal relationships. This would require a careful balance to ensure that privacy is respected and that people are not coerced into revealing sensitive information without their consent.",
    "**Educational Enhancement**: Use this power to ensure students tell the truth about their learning progress, homework completion, and understanding of subjects. This would help educators identify genuine gaps in knowledge, provide tailored support, and promote an environment where learning is valued over grades.",
    "**Conflict Resolution**: Apply this power in conflict resolution processes, such as mediation or negotiation. By making all parties truthful, misunderstandings and hidden agendas can be exposed, leading to more equitable outcomes and fostering deeper understanding between conflicting parties.",
    "**Public Accountability**: Implement a system where public officials, celebrities, and influential figures must tell the truth in interviews, speeches, and statements to the media and public.
