    "Sand-Sational Art: If all sand disappeared, I would use the beach as a canvas to create vibrant and intricate art pieces. I would mix sand with water to create a paint-like substance and use it to draw elaborate designs on the beach. The art would be temporary, as the tide would wash it away, but the memories of the beach's beauty would last forever.",
    "Wave-Powered Fun: Without sand, the beach would become a hub for water-based activities. I would use the waves to create a giant wave pool, where people could surf, bodyboard, or simply float on their backs and enjoy the ride. The pool would be designed with different wave patterns and heights to cater to all skill levels.",
    "Beachside Biosphere: In a world without sand, the beach would become a biosphere, teeming with life. I would create a series of interconnected tunnels and domes that would house a variety of marine life, from sea turtles to colorful fish. Visitors could explore the biosphere and learn about the importance of preserving our oceans and marine ecosystems.",
    "Sand-Free Sandcastles: Instead of building traditional sandcastles, I would create structures made entirely of recycled materials. The beach would become an art gallery, showcasing creative sculptures and installations made from plastic bottles, cans, and other recyclables. The art would be both beautiful and thought-provoking, raising awareness about the impact of pollution on our oceans and beaches.",
    "Beachside Parkour: Without sand, the beach would become a giant playground for parkour enthusiasts. I would design a series of obstacles and challenges that would test the limits of parkour athletes, including wall climbs, rail grinds, and gap jumps. The parkour course would be built into the surrounding cliffs and rocks, offering breathtaking views of the ocean and surrounding landscape."
