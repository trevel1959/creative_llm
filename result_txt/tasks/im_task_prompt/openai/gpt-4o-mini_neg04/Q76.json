    "**Multi-Functional Hair Tie with Built-in Hairbrush**: Design a hair tie that incorporates a compact, foldable hairbrush. The brush could be hidden within the hair tie’s design, allowing users to quickly detangle their hair before tying it up. This would be particularly useful for those on the go, as it combines two essential hair care tools into one stylish accessory.",
    "**Eco-Friendly Hair Tie with Reusable Materials**: Create a line of hair ties made from biodegradable or recycled materials, such as organic cotton or recycled plastics. These eco-friendly hair ties could come in various styles and colors, appealing to environmentally conscious consumers. Additionally, a recycling program could be introduced where customers can send back old hair ties for recycling.",
    "**Color-Changing Hair Tie**: Develop a hair tie that changes color based on temperature or UV exposure. This feature would not only be fun and visually appealing but could also serve as a reminder to users when they’ve been in the sun too long or when their body temperature rises during workouts. This innovative design would add an interactive element to the simple hair tie.",
    "**Adjustable Hair Tie for Different Hair Types**: Design an adjustable hair tie that can expand or contract based on the thickness and texture of the hair. This would cater to users with varying hair types, ensuring a secure hold without causing damage or discomfort. The adjustable mechanism could be hidden within the design, maintaining an aesthetic appeal.",
    "**Decorative Hair Tie with Interchangeable Charms**: Create a hair tie that features a base with a slot for interchangeable charms. Users could personalize their hair ties with different charms representing their interests, hobbies, or favorite colors. This customization would make hair ties not just practical, but also a fun fashion statement, allowing for self-expression."
