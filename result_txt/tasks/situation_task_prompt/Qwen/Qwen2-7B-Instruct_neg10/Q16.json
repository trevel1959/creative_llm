    "**Adapting to the Industrial Revolution:** Imagine being transported to the late 18th century, when the Industrial Revolution was transforming society. Your expertise in technology could help streamline manufacturing processes, improve safety regulations, and foster innovation. You might work alongside inventors like James Watt or Robert Fulton, contributing to the development of steam engines, iron bridges, or steamboats.",
    "**Navigating the Space Age:** If you were to wake up in the year 1969, just after the first moon landing, you'd have to navigate the rapidly evolving space industry. Using your knowledge of modern astronomy and space exploration, you could advise on satellite technology, lunar bases, or interstellar travel. Your understanding of contemporary engineering principles would enable you to innovate solutions for challenges faced by astronauts and space agencies."
