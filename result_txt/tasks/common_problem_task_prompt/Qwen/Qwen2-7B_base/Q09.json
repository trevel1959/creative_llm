    "Injury or health problems: Running over long distances can strain the body's joints and muscles, increase the chances of injuries, such as the shin splints, knee problems, tendonitis, and stress fractures. Therefore, runners need to maintain proper posture, wear appropriate shoes, and work on their training schedule to ensure they don't overdo it.",
    "Heatstroke or dehydration: If the half marathon is held in a hot or humid environment, the runners are at a higher risk of heatstroke or dehydration, which can reduce their performance and negatively affect their health. To avoid this, organizers should provide adequate hydrating fluids and make sure that the temperature is not too high.",
    "Logistics and organization: The race organizers must prepare a clear and thorough event plan, including registration, start and finish lines, aid stations, medical staff, and parking arrangements. If there are not enough resources, the race could be delayed or not run at all.",
    "Weather conditions: In many locations, the half marathon is held outdoors, and adverse weather conditions, such as extreme cold or heat, rain, fog, or lightning, can jeopardize the health and safety of the participants. Therefore, organizers should be prepared for different scenarios and make necessary adjustments, such as moving the race inside or delaying it for a few hours.",
    "Safety of participants: Race organizers must take the necessary precautions to ensure the safety of participants, including having proper safety gear, medical teams on standby, first aid stations close to the aid stations, and clear communication to alert participants of any hazards."
