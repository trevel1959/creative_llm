    "Smart Stapler: Create a stapler that can automatically recognize and sort documents based on their content, such as separating bills from receipts or categorizing emails based on their importance. The stapler could use AI-powered image recognition technology to identify the content of the documents and sort them accordingly.",
    "Staple-less Stapler: Design a stapler that uses a unique mechanism to bind documents together without the need for staples. For example, the stapler could use a spring-loaded mechanism to bind the pages together or use a special adhesive to secure them in place.",
    "Customizable Stapler: Create a stapler that allows users to customize the size and shape of the staples. This could be achieved through a simple adjustment mechanism or by using interchangeable staple cartridges. This would allow users to tailor the stapler to their specific needs and preferences.",
    "Stapler with Built-in Shredder: Develop a stapler that incorporates a built-in shredder, allowing users to securely dispose of sensitive documents. The shredder could be activated by a simple button press or by using a foot pedal. This would eliminate the need for a separate shredder and save space on the desk.",
    "Stapler with Ergonomic Design: Design a stapler that is ergonomically designed to reduce strain and discomfort when using the device. The stapler could have a contoured grip, an adjustable height, and a weighted base to reduce vibrations and improve stability. This would make the stapler more comfortable to use for extended periods of time and reduce the risk of injury."
