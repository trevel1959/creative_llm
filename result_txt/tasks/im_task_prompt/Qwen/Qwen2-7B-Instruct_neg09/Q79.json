    "**Transformative Closet Organizer**: Create a multifunctional hanger that doubles as both a clothes organizer and a space-saving tool. The hanger can have additional hooks for belts, ties, or accessories, and clips for scarves or bags. The design could also include detachable sections, allowing you to customize the arrangement based on your clothing needs.",
    "**Eco-Friendly Hangers**: Design biodegradable hangers made from materials like bamboo, cornstarch, or recycled plastics. These hangers can be produced in various shapes (like a traditional hanger, coat rack, or even a wall-mounted option) to cater to different clothing items. This idea promotes sustainability and reduces environmental impact.",
    "**Smart Hangers**: Integrate technology into hangers by adding sensors that can track when an item of clothing has been worn or unworn for a certain period. This information can be sent to a connected app on your smartphone, reminding you to rotate your wardrobe or donate unused items. The hangers could also include LED lights or QR codes linking to product care instructions.",
    "**Customizable Clothing Hangers**: Develop a system where users can customize their own hangers according to their preferences. This could involve options for color, material, size, and shape. Users might choose a hanger that fits their specific clothing styles, such as wider hangers for bulkier coats or smaller ones for delicate garments.",
    "**Interactive Fashion Display Hangers**: Create interactive hangers that allow customers to see how different clothing items look on them through augmented reality (AR) technology. When placed in front of a mirror or camera, the hanger displays digital images of outfits, providing a virtual fitting room experience without needing physical spaces or actual clothing."
