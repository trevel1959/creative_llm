    "**Edible Aroma Bombs**: Develop a line of edible, sugar-based candies infused with natural essential oils. These bite-sized treats would not only tantalize the taste buds but also release a subtle, pleasant aroma as they dissolve in the mouth. The flavors and fragrances could be tailored to evoke specific emotions or moods, such as a calming lavender or an invigorating citrus. This innovative approach would combine the senses of taste and smell, creating a multisensory experience.",
    "**Scent-Embracing Architecture**: Design buildings and public spaces that incorporate fragrant elements, such as aromatic plants, herbs, or flowers, into their structures. This could be achieved through the use of fragrant materials, like scented woods or aromatic paints, or by incorporating living green walls and roofs. The goal would be to create immersive environments that engage the sense of smell and promote well-being. For example, a hospital could be designed with calming scents to reduce stress, while a shopping mall could feature uplifting fragrances to boost customer mood.",
