    "**Technical Malfunctions**: The satellite and rocket systems are complex, and any malfunction—whether it’s a software glitch, a mechanical failure, or a communication breakdown—could jeopardize the mission. This could lead to loss of the satellite or an incomplete mission. To address this, rigorous pre-launch testing and simulations should be conducted, along with having contingency plans in place for various failure scenarios.",
    "**Regulatory Compliance**: There are numerous regulations and international treaties governing space launches, including spectrum allocation, debris mitigation, and safety protocols. Failing to comply with these regulations could result in legal penalties, mission delays, or even the inability to launch. Establishing a dedicated compliance team to ensure all regulatory requirements are met well in advance of the launch date is essential.",
    "**Funding and Budget Overruns**: Space missions often face budget constraints, and unexpected expenses can lead to funding shortages. Issues such as cost overruns due to delays, design changes, or technological challenges can put the entire mission at risk. To combat this, implementing a robust financial management system that includes thorough cost estimation, regular audits, and contingency funds can help keep the project on track.",
    "**Public Relations and Media Scrutiny**: High-profile space launches attract significant media attention, and any failure can lead to negative public perception and loss of stakeholder confidence. Miscommunication or lack of transparency can exacerbate this issue. To manage this risk, a proactive communication strategy should be developed, including regular updates to the public and media, and clear messaging regarding the mission's objectives and challenges.",
    "**Environmental Impact**: The environmental impact of rocket launches, including emissions and noise pollution, is a growing concern. This could lead to community opposition or regulatory pushback, particularly if launches are frequent. Conducting thorough environmental assessments and engaging with local communities to address their concerns can help mitigate potential backlash and promote sustainable practices."
