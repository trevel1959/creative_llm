    "Plastic-eating microbes: If plastic could biodegrade as quickly as paper, we could see the emergence of microorganisms that specifically feed on plastic waste. These microbes could break down plastic into smaller, more manageable pieces, reducing the amount of plastic in landfills and oceans. This would help to mitigate the harmful effects of plastic pollution on the environment and wildlife.",
    "Biodegradable plastic alternatives: With plastic biodegrading at the same rate as paper, there would be a renewed focus on developing biodegradable plastic alternatives. These alternatives could be made from renewable resources like corn starch, sugarcane, or potato starch, which would break down naturally in the environment. This would reduce the amount of plastic waste that ends up in landfills and oceans, and provide a more sustainable solution for packaging and other applications.",
    "Plastic-digesting buildings: With plastic biodegrading as quickly as paper, buildings could be designed with built-in plastic digesters. These digesters could break down plastic waste on-site, reducing the amount of plastic that needs to be sent to landfills. This would not only help to reduce plastic waste but also provide a new source of energy for buildings through the conversion of plastic into heat or electricity.",
    "Plastic-eating plants: Scientists could develop new plant species that are capable of breaking down plastic waste. These plants could be genetically engineered to produce enzymes that specifically target plastic, breaking it down into smaller pieces that can be easily degraded by microorganisms. This would provide a natural and sustainable way to reduce plastic waste, and could potentially be used to clean up existing plastic pollution.",
    "Plastic-based soil amendments: If plastic could biodegrade as quickly as paper, we could see a shift in the way we use plastic waste in agriculture. Plastic waste could be converted into soil amendments that improve soil health and fertility. For example, plastic waste could be broken down and mixed into soil to improve its structure, increase water retention, and provide a source of nutrients for plants. This would provide a new use for plastic waste, reducing"
