    "The human eye is very sensitive to light. The eye has a lens that focuses light on the retina. The retina is a layer of nerve cells that line the back of the eye. The retina converts light into electrical impulses that are sent to the brain. The brain then interprets these impulses as images. The eye is a very complex organ and there are many different parts that work together to allow us to see.",
