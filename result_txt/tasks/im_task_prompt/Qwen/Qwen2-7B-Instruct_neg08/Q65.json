    "**Task Buddy System**: Create a collaborative task system using an electric kettle. For instance, you can use it to signal when someone needs help finishing a task. Each person in the team gets a mug or cup, and the electric kettle is placed in a central location. Whenever someone feels overwhelmed, they turn on the kettle. This signals to everyone that they might need assistance. It encourages teamwork, empathy, and helps prevent feelings of isolation or jealousy.",
    "**Progress Indicators**: Use the electric kettle as a visual progress indicator for tasks. For example, if you're working on a project with multiple stages, each stage could be marked by a different color of water. When the kettle reaches the top, it indicates the completion of that particular task. This not only adds a fun, interactive element to your work but also serves as a tangible reminder of progress.",
    "**Creative Time-Outs**: Use the electric kettle to introduce a creative time-out during busy periods. Set the kettle to go off at random intervals throughout the day. When it does, everyone takes a short break to engage in a creative activity like brainstorming, drawing, or writing. This helps to refresh minds and reduce stress, potentially increasing productivity and reducing feelings of jealousy.",
    "**Mindfulness and Productivity Tool**: Incorporate the electric kettle into a mindfulness routine to enhance focus and productivity. Set a specific task timer and use the kettle to mark the end of each session. For example, after every 25-minute Pomodoro cycle, the kettle sounds, signaling a five-minute break. This creates a ritual that can help manage time effectively and improve concentration.",
    "**Motivational Challenges**: Organize a friendly competition where participants aim to complete tasks faster than the time taken by their peers. The electric kettle can act as a countdown timer, adding a sense of urgency and excitement. The participant who finishes their task the fastest can earn points or rewards. This gamification technique can motivate individuals to work more efficiently and can help alleviate feelings of jealousy by focusing on personal growth rather than comparing with others."
