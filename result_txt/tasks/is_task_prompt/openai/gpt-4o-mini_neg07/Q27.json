Roan, with his harp, played a powerful tune that resonated through the valley, mesmerizing the dragon. The beast, entranced, decided to leave the land in peace.

    "Deep in the jungle, there was a lion named Zara who was born without a roar. She felt inferior among her peers, but she had a gift for storytelling. One evening, a severe drought struck, and the animals were anxious. Zara gathered them under the ancient baobab tree and spun tales of hope and resilience. Her words ignited courage in their hearts, and they worked together to dig wells and find water. When the rains finally came, the animals celebrated Zara’s wisdom. They learned that sometimes, the loudest voices are not the ones that roar, but those that inspire and unite.",

While others panicked, Leo listened to the winds and sensed the safest path. He led the pride to safety, away from the storm’s wrath. Grateful, the lions realized that strength came in many forms, and they embraced Leo as their leader, understanding that a gentle heart can be more powerful than a mighty roar.",
