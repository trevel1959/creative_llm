    "Once in a hidden glen, there lived a group of mice gifted with melodious voices. Each night, under the silver glow of the moon, they gathered to sing enchanting songs that echoed through the forest. One day, a traveling musician heard their sweet harmonies and invited them to perform at a grand festival. Nervous yet excited, the mice agreed. On the day of the festival, they took the stage, their hearts pounding. As they sang, the crowd was mesmerized, and the mice realized their voices could bridge the gap between their tiny world and the vast realm of dreams. They became legends.",
