    "Solar-Powered Lanterns: One creative solution to light up a room at night without lamps or lighting fixtures is to use solar-powered lanterns. These lanterns can be placed in windows or on walls, and they use the energy of the sun to charge during the day, providing a soft and warm glow at night. They are eco-friendly, energy-efficient, and require no electricity, making them a perfect solution for a post-apocalyptic world without electricity.",
