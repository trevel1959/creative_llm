    "**Interchangeable Brush Heads with Magnetic Attachment**:    - A paintbrush designed with a magnetic attachment system that allows artists to quickly switch between various brush heads (flat, round, filbert, etc.) without needing to clean or replace the entire brush. This would streamline the painting process, allowing for seamless transitions between different techniques and styles, all while maintaining a single handle for comfort and control.",
    "**Ergonomic Grip with Adjustable Weight**:    - This paintbrush would feature an ergonomic handle that can be adjusted for weight distribution, allowing artists to customize how the brush feels in their hand. The handle could have a dial or slider that adjusts the weight, making it easier for artists to work for extended periods without fatigue. This would cater to different painting styles, from delicate detail work to broader strokes.",
    "**Integrated Paint Reservoir**:    - Imagine a paintbrush with a built-in reservoir that holds paint, allowing artists to paint continuously without needing to dip into a palette. The reservoir could be refillable and have a controlled flow mechanism, ensuring a consistent supply of paint to the bristles. This would be especially useful for plein air artists who need to work quickly and efficiently outdoors.",
    "**Self-Cleaning Brush Technology**:    - This innovative paintbrush would incorporate self-cleaning technology, using ultrasonic vibrations to remove paint residue from the bristles after use. Artists could simply place the brush in a cleaning station, and the device would use sound waves to break down and dislodge dried paint, making cleanup a breeze and extending the life of the brush.",
    "**LED Light for Precision Work**:    - A paintbrush equipped with a small, adjustable LED light on the handle would provide illumination for detailed work, especially in low-light conditions. This feature would help artists see their canvas more clearly and improve accuracy when working on intricate details. The light could be adjustable in brightness and angle, allowing for maximum versatility."
