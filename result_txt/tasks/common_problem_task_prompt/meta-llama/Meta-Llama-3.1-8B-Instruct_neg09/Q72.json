    "**Solar Energy Harvesting System**: Design a power plant that utilizes a combination of solar panels, mirrors, and lenses to focus and concentrate sunlight onto a central point, generating immense heat that can be converted into electricity using a steam turbine. The system could also incorporate a phase change material to store excess energy during the day for use at night.",
    "**Tidal Energy Generation**: Develop a power plant that harnesses the kinetic energy of ocean tides using a series of underwater turbines or barrages. The turbines could be designed to rotate in both directions, capturing energy during both the incoming and outgoing tides. The plant could also incorporate a desalination system to provide fresh water for local communities.",
    "**Bio-Energy with Carbon Capture**: Create a power plant that utilizes waste biomass from agricultural or forestry activities to produce electricity and capture the carbon dioxide emissions. The system could incorporate a gasifier to convert the biomass into a synthetic gas, which would then be used to generate electricity in a combined cycle power plant. The captured CO2 could be stored underground or utilized in various industrial applications.",
    "**Wind-Solar Hybrid Power Plant**: Design a power plant that combines wind turbines and solar panels to maximize energy production. The system could incorporate a energy storage system, such as batteries, to stabilize the grid and provide a reliable source of power. The plant could also be equipped with advanced weather forecasting systems to optimize energy production.",
    "**Geothermal Energy Plant with Enhanced Geothermal Systems (EGS)**: Develop a power plant that utilizes EGS technology to access hot rocks deep beneath the Earth's surface. The system could involve drilling and stimulating the rock formations to create a network of fractures, allowing hot water or steam to flow to the surface and generate electricity. The plant could also incorporate a closed-loop system to minimize environmental impact and maximize efficiency."
