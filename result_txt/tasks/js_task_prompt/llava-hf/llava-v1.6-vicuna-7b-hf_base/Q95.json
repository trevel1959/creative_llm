    "Advanced Filtration System: The habitat would have a state-of-the-art filtration system that could remove pollutants, toxins, and waste from the water and air, ensuring a clean and healthy environment for the animals.",
    "Underwater Viewing Decks: The habitat would have underwater viewing decks that would allow visitors to observe the animals without disturbing them. This would be especially beneficial for species that are not commonly seen by humans, such as deep-sea creatures.",
    "Artificial Sunlight: The habitat would have a system that could replicate the natural sunlight, allowing animals that require a specific amount of light for their survival to thrive. This would be especially beneficial for nocturnal animals or those that live in areas with limited sunlight.",
    "Multi-Species Zones: The habitat would be divided into different zones that cater to the specific needs of different species. For example, there could be a zone for aquatic animals, a zone for terrestrial animals, and a zone for arboreal animals. This would allow the animals to coexist peacefully and interact with others of their kind.",
    "Scent-Based Navigation: The habitat would have a system that would allow the animals to navigate through the environment using their sense of smell. This would be especially beneficial for animals that rely on their sense of smell to find food, water, and mates."
