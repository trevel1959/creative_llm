    "**Architecture and Construction**: Buildings and structures would have to be redesigned to withstand less gravitational force. This would lead to innovations in materials and construction techniques. For example, skyscrapers might be lighter and more flexible, while bridges could be thinner yet stronger to accommodate reduced gravitational loads.",
    "**Space Exploration**: With less gravitational pull, spacecraft could potentially achieve orbit with less fuel, making space travel more efficient and cost-effective. This could lead to increased space exploration, including missions to other planets and moons within our solar system, as well as the potential for human colonization of celestial bodies.",
    "**Agriculture**: Agriculture practices on Earth would change dramatically. Crops could grow faster and larger without the need for heavy support structures. Hydroponics and aeroponics might become more prevalent, allowing for vertical farming and space agriculture. The development of crops specifically adapted to lower gravity environments could also occur.",
    "**Healthcare**: Reduced gravity could impact human health, both positively and negatively. On one hand, it could help in treating certain conditions by reducing the strain on bones and muscles. However, it could also lead to issues like bone loss and muscle atrophy. This could spur advancements in healthcare technology, such as devices that simulate Earth-like conditions during long-term space missions.",
    "**Entertainment**: The entertainment industry could benefit from this scenario. Sports, movies, and theme parks could incorporate elements of weightlessness, creating new forms of entertainment. For instance, amusement park rides could simulate zero-gravity experiences, and movies could feature scenes shot in true zero-gravity environments."
