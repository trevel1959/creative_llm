    "**Submarine Housing**: Imagine a future where underwater housing becomes the norm in coastal areas threatened by rising sea levels. These structures could be built on the ocean floor, allowing for a normal lifestyle with access to sunlight through transparent domes or windows. They would also provide a buffer against storm surges and flooding.",
    "**Floating Cities**: Develop a concept of floating cities that can move as sea levels rise. These could be massive, self-sustaining structures with advanced technology to regulate their buoyancy. They could incorporate renewable energy sources, water purification systems, and vertical farming to sustain life.",
    "**Terraced Coastal Settlements**: Design communities built into the sides of hills or cliffs along the coast. These settlements could use gravity to manage water runoff and reduce the impact of floods. They would also have terraces for agriculture and living spaces, offering a unique aesthetic and efficient use of space.",
    "**High-Elevation Urban Environments**: Construct new urban areas at higher elevations inland. This could involve building skyscrapers and urban centers on platforms raised above the current sea level, or creating new cities on artificial islands or man-made mountains. These environments would need robust infrastructure to support large populations and industries.",
    "**Waterproofed Coastal Cities**: Adapt existing coastal cities by waterproofing them. This could involve reinforcing buildings and infrastructure to withstand flooding, creating drainage systems capable of handling extreme weather conditions, and using advanced technologies like smart grids to manage resources efficiently. Additionally, these cities could implement sustainable practices like rainwater harvesting and green roofs to mitigate the effects of rising sea levels. "
