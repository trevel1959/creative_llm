    "**Eco-Friendly Detergent Dispenser**: Create a washing machine with a built-in eco-friendly detergent dispenser that uses biodegradable capsules. Users can choose the amount of detergent based on load size and fabric type, minimizing waste and ensuring the right amount is used for each wash. This could also include a feature that automatically dispenses fabric softener and stain removers, reducing the need for multiple products.",
    "**Integrated Folding Mechanism**: Imagine a washing machine that not only washes and dries clothes but also has an integrated folding mechanism. After the drying cycle, the machine could use robotic arms to fold clothes neatly, eliminating the need for the tedious task of folding laundry. This would be a game-changer for busy households, saving time and keeping clothes organized.",
    "**Multi-Functional Laundry Hub**: Transform the traditional laundry room by designing a washing machine that is part of a multi-functional laundry hub. This hub could include a washer, dryer, ironing station, and storage for detergents and fabric softeners. The machine could feature a touchscreen interface that guides users through each step, from washing to ironing, and even offers laundry tips and tricks.",
    "**Virtual Reality Laundry Experience**: Introduce a virtual reality (VR) feature that makes doing laundry more engaging. Users could wear VR headsets and enter a gamified laundry experience where they can complete fun challenges related to sorting clothes, selecting wash cycles, and more. This could be especially appealing for families with children, turning a mundane chore into an interactive activity.",
    "**Laundry Monitoring and Maintenance App**: Create an app that connects to the washing machine and monitors its performance. It could provide real-time updates on water and energy usage, send alerts for maintenance needs, and offer troubleshooting tips. Users could also access a laundry history log to track their washing habits and find ways to improve efficiency and reduce costs."
