    "**Urban Planning and Development**: This power could be harnessed for urban development projects. By seeing through walls, I could assess the spatial relationships between buildings and their surroundings, allowing for better city planning. I could identify underutilized spaces and propose redevelopment projects that could enhance community resources, parks, and public transport systems. This could also aid in ensuring that new developments do not infringe on existing structures or ecosystems, leading to more sustainable urban environments.",
    "**Historical Preservation**: I would use this ability to explore and preserve historical sites. By seeing through walls of ancient structures, I could uncover hidden artifacts, understand the original layout of buildings, and document changes over time. This could provide valuable insights into past cultures and civilizations, helping historians and archaeologists to piece together history more accurately. Additionally, it could assist in restoration efforts by revealing how to best preserve the integrity of these sites while still allowing for modern use.",
    "**Emergency Response and Rescue Operations**: In emergencies such as fires, earthquakes, or building collapses, the ability to see through walls could be life-saving. First responders could locate trapped individuals quickly and assess the structural integrity of buildings before entering. This would enhance rescue operations, reduce response times, and ultimately save lives. Training programs could be developed to teach emergency personnel how to utilize this power effectively in crisis situations.",
    "**Conflict Resolution**: This power could be applied in conflict resolution scenarios, such as disputes between neighbors or legal cases involving property lines.

This could lead to quicker resolutions, reducing the need for lengthy legal battles and fostering a sense of community cooperation.",
    "**Home Renovation and Real Estate**: For homeowners and real estate agents, the ability to see through walls would be invaluable. Homeowners could assess the condition of plumbing, wiring, and insulation before purchasing or renovating a property, ensuring they make informed decisions. Real estate agents could use this ability to provide potential buyers with insights into the true value of a property, highlighting hidden features or necessary repairs that might not be visible during a standard walkthrough."
