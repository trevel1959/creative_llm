    "**Portable Energy Module**: A compact, wearable device that can be used to store and release energy. This module could be worn on a belt or clipped to clothing, providing an on-the-go power source for electronic devices, emergency situations, or outdoor activities. It could be powered by a small battery that can be recharged with solar panels or other renewable energy sources.",
    "**Energy-Sharing Network**: A decentralized network that enables the sharing of energy between individuals and communities. This system would allow neighbors to exchange excess energy from solar panels or wind turbines, reducing the need for centralized power plants and promoting local energy production.",
    "**Energy Harvesting Materials**: A line of materials that can convert environmental energy into usable power. These materials could be integrated into buildings, vehicles, and infrastructure, providing a continuous flow of energy with minimal environmental impact.",
    "**Energy-Efficient Transportation**: A fleet of vehicles that use advanced technologies to maximize fuel efficiency and minimize emissions. These vehicles would be designed with aerodynamic shapes, lightweight materials, and hybrid or electric power systems to reduce the environmental impact of transportation.",
    "**Energy-Conserving Cities**: Urban planning and infrastructure that incorporates energy-saving measures at every level. This could include green buildings, energy-efficient transportation systems, and public spaces designed to reduce energy consumption and waste."
