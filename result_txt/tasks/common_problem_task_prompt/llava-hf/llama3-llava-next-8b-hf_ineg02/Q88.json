    "Media Coverage: A candidate may struggle to gain media coverage, especially if they are not well-known or the media is biased towards a particular party or ideology. This could make it difficult for the candidate to reach a wider audience and build public support.",
    "Negative Campaigning: Political opponents may engage in negative campaigning, attacking the candidate's personal or professional record, rather than focusing on policy issues. This can tarnish the candidate's image and make it difficult to win over undecided voters.",
    "Volunteer Recruitment: A candidate may have difficulty recruiting volunteers to help with campaign activities such as door-knocking, phone banking, and social media outreach. This can limit the campaign's ability to reach potential voters and build momentum.",
    "Social Media Disasters: A candidate may inadvertently post controversial or inappropriate content on social media, which could harm their reputation and damage their campaign.",
    "Debate Performance: A candidate may struggle during debates, either by not being able to articulate their platform effectively or by being outshone by their opponent. This can lead to a loss of support among undecided voters."
