    "Skylights: Installing skylights in the ceiling would allow natural light to enter the room during the day, even when the sun isn't visible. This would create a well-lit space and help reduce the need for artificial lighting.",
    "Battery-operated lanterns: Keeping a few battery-operated lanterns on hand would provide a portable and convenient source of light when needed. They can be easily moved around the room or taken with you if you need to work outside.",
    "Candles and lanterns: Using candles and lanterns can provide a warm, ambient light that creates a cozy atmosphere. This can be particularly appealing in the evenings when the natural light is low.",
    "LED strips: Installing LED strips along the walls or under furniture can provide a subtle, ambient light that can be controlled with a smartphone app. This would allow you to adjust the lighting to your preference and create a customized lighting environment.",
    "Reflective surfaces: Placing mirrors or other reflective surfaces around the room can help bounce light around the space, making it appear brighter and more spacious. This can be particularly effective in smaller rooms where every bit of light counts."
