    "Tire-themed Art Installation: Create a large-scale art installation that incorporates tires in a creative and visually appealing way. The installation could feature tires stacked in a pyramid formation, with each tire painted in a different color or pattern. The installation could also include lights or projections that create a dynamic and immersive experience for viewers.",
    "Tire-powered Generator: Develop a generator that uses old tires as a source of energy. The generator could use the tire's rubber as a material for storing energy, which could then be released as electricity. This could be a sustainable and eco-friendly way to generate power, especially in areas where access to traditional energy sources is limited.",
    "Tire-based Water Filtration System: Create a water filtration system that uses tires as the primary component. The system could use the tire's porous rubber to filter out impurities and contaminants from water, making it safe for drinking or other uses. This could be particularly useful in areas where access to clean water is limited.",
    "Tire-inspired Furniture Designs: Design furniture pieces that are inspired by the shape and structure of tires. For example, a tire-inspired chair could have a curved, circular shape, with the tire's rubber used as a durable and comfortable cushioning material. This could add a unique and eye-catching element to any room.",
    "Tire-based Sports Equipment: Develop sports equipment that incorporates tires in innovative ways. For example, a tire-based basketball hoop could provide a more challenging and exciting game, as the tire's rubber would provide a bouncy and unpredictable surface for the ball to bounce off of. This could also be applied to other sports, such as soccer or volleyball, creating a new and interesting playing experience."
