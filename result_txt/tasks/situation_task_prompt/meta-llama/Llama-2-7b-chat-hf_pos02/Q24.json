    "Artificial vision aids: With the sudden disappearance of glasses and contact lenses, people with poor vision could turn to artificial vision aids such as bionic eyes or retinal implants. These advanced technologies could provide a new sense of sight, allowing individuals to navigate and interact with their surroundings in ways previously impossible.",
    "Brain-Computer Interfaces: Another solution could be the development of brain-computer interfaces (BCIs) that can bypass the visual system altogether. BCIs use sensors to detect electrical signals in the brain and translate them into visual information. This would allow people with poor vision to \"see\" through their thoughts, giving them a new level of independence and autonomy.",
    "Advanced prosthetics: Prosthetic limbs could be designed to mimic the function of human limbs, including the ability to perceive and interpret visual information. This would enable individuals with visual impairments to navigate and interact with their environment in new ways, using their sense of touch and other senses.",
    "Virtual reality training: With the disappearance of glasses and contact lenses, people with poor vision could turn to virtual reality (VR) training to improve their visual skills. VR technology could be used to simulate real-world environments and tasks, allowing individuals to practice and improve their visual perception and navigation skills in a controlled and safe environment.",
    "Social and community support: The loss of glasses and contact lenses could also lead to a greater emphasis on social and community support for people with poor vision. Communities could come together to provide assistance and support, such as guide dogs, transportation services, and home modification services, to help individuals with visual impairments navigate and interact with their environment."
