    "Universal Gratitude Day: Everyone in the world would have to take one day a week, say Wednesday, to express gratitude to each other and to the world around them. This could be done through acts of kindness, thank-you notes, or simply taking a moment to reflect on the good things in their lives. This rule would encourage people to cultivate a positive mindset and appreciate the beauty and kindness in the world.",
    "Nature Conservation Hour: One hour a week, everyone would be required to take a break from their daily activities and spend time in nature, whether it's going for a walk, planting a tree, or simply sitting in a park. This would help people connect with the natural world and appreciate its beauty and importance. It would also encourage people to take action to protect the environment and preserve the natural world for future generations.",
    "Creative Expression Day: Everyone would be encouraged to engage in some form of creative expression, whether it's through art, music, writing, or dance. This could be done individually or in groups, and the goal would be to foster creativity and self-expression. This rule would help people tap into their inner selves and find new ways to express themselves, leading to a more fulfilling and creative life.",
    "No Technology Thursday: Once a week, everyone would be required to disconnect from their electronic devices and spend the day unplugged. This could involve spending time with family and friends, reading a book, or engaging in a hobby. This rule would help people break free from the constant distraction of technology and reconnect with the world around them. It would also encourage people to find new ways to relax and enjoy life without relying on technology.",
    "Global Volunteer Day: Everyone in the world would be encouraged to volunteer their time and skills to help others. This could involve working with local charities, participating in community clean-up events, or volunteering at a soup kitchen. This rule would help people connect with their communities and make a positive impact on the world. It would also foster a sense of social responsibility and compassion, leading to a more caring and supportive society."
