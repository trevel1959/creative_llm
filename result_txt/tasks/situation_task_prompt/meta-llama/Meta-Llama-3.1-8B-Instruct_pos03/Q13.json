    "**Virtual Reality Portals**: With the disappearance of phones, people would need a new way to communicate. Virtual reality portals would become the norm, allowing individuals to connect with each other in immersive, 3D environments. These portals would be accessible through special headsets or glasses, enabling people to see, hear, and interact with each other in real-time, regardless of their physical location. Imagine being able to have a virtual coffee with a friend who lives on the other side of the world, or attend a virtual concert with friends who are scattered across the globe. Virtual reality portals would revolutionize the way we connect with each other, making it feel like we're right next to each other, even when we're not.",
    "**Smart Contact Lenses**: In a world without phones, people would need a new way to access information and communicate with others. Smart contact lenses would become the solution, providing a seamless and intuitive way to interact with the world around us. These lenses would have a tiny display screen, allowing users to receive messages, check the time, and access information on demand. They would also have built-in cameras, microphones, and sensors, enabling users to take photos, record videos, and even track their health and fitness metrics. With smart contact lenses, people would be able to stay connected and informed without needing to carry a separate device.",
    "**Biometric Implants**: In a world without phones, people might turn to biometric implants to stay connected with others. These implants would be tiny devices that are inserted under the skin, allowing users to access information and communicate with others through subtle changes in their biometric data. For example, a user might receive a message by feeling a slight vibration or temperature change in their wrist or forearm. Biometric implants would provide a seamless and discreet way to stay connected, eliminating the need for separate devices or interfaces.",
    "**Neurointerface Headbands**: Neurointerface headbands would become the ultimate tool for staying connected in a world without phones. These headbands would use electroencephalography (EEG) sensors to read brain activity, allowing users to control devices and communicate with others through their thoughts. Imagine being able to send a message to a friend by simply thinking about it, or controlling a robot to perform tasks for you. Neurointerface headbands would revolutionize the way we interact with technology, making it feel like an extension of our own minds.",
