    "**Inflatable Hovercrafts**: Develop inflatable, semi-rigid craft that can be inflated on land and then floated on water. They would have powerful jet engines to maintain lift above the water surface. These hovercrafts could be easily transported by air or truck and deployed quickly once at the water's edge.",
    "**Aquatic Bicycles**: Create bicycles that can be used on water, similar to modern water bikes but with added stability and features like retractable blades for propulsion. They'd be powered by pedaling, allowing for efficient travel with minimal environmental impact. They could also fold down for easy storage and transport.",
    "**Human-Powered Submarines**: Develop submarines that can be manually propelled through water using human power. This would involve designing compact, lightweight submersibles with large propellers and an ergonomic control system. Crews could navigate these subs by turning the propellers with their hands, making use of the ocean's currents for long-distance travel.",
    "**Portable Jetpacks**: Design personal jetpacks that are lightweight enough to be carried by hand and can be worn like a backpack when in use. They would use jet propulsion to lift the user above the water surface, allowing them to travel at high speeds over large bodies of water. The jetpacks could be equipped with wings for gliding, enabling longer-range travel.",
    "**Underwater Gliders**: Utilize advanced buoyancy control technology to create underwater gliders that can glide through water with minimal energy input. These gliders would be equipped with solar panels for charging and could be programmed to follow predetermined routes. They could be deployed from land and recovered at a later time, providing a means of sustained, automated travel across oceans."
