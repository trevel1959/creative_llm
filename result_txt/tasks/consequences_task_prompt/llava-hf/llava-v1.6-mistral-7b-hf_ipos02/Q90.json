    "Hyperinflation: In an attempt to stimulate the economy, governments might resort to printing more money to replace the lost funds. This could lead to hyperinflation, as there would be an oversupply of money in the economy, causing prices to rise rapidly.",
    "Global Financial Crisis: The erasure of all world debt could lead to a global financial crisis, as the loss of funds would disrupt the balance of international trade and investment. This could cause a domino effect, with countries experiencing financial instability and potentially defaulting on their debts.",
    "Economic Depression: The loss of funds and the economic shock could lead to a prolonged economic depression, as businesses struggle to recover from the sudden loss of capital and consumers cut back on spending due to uncertainty.",
    "Government Default: Governments would face the challenge of defaulting on their debts, as they would no longer have the funds to service their loans. This could lead to a loss of confidence in government bonds and a decline in the value of the currency.",
    "Redistribution of Wealth: The erasure of all world debt could lead to a redistribution of wealth, as the funds previously held by creditors would be transferred to debtors. This could create a more equitable distribution of wealth, but it could also lead to social unrest if the process is not managed carefully."
