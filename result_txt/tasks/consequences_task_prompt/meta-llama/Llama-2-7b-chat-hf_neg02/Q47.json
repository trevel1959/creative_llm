    "Evolution of the Digestive System: If humans no longer needed to eat food for survival, the digestive system would undergo significant changes. The body would no longer require the same level of nutrient absorption, and the digestive organs would shrink and become less complex. Over time, the digestive system could evolve into a more efficient and specialized system, capable of extracting nutrients from alternative sources such as air or water.",
