    "**Enhanced Sensory Adaptation:** People with poor vision could adapt to their condition by enhancing their other senses, particularly hearing and touch. For instance, they might learn to rely on echolocation techniques, which involve making sounds and listening for the echoes to navigate their environment. This would require training in creating distinct sounds and interpreting their echoes accurately.",
    "**Improved Lighting Systems:** In response to the disappearance of glasses and contact lenses, there could be a surge in innovation around lighting systems designed to improve visibility. For example, smart LED lighting that automatically adjusts brightness and color temperature based on the user's needs could significantly aid those with poor vision. These lights might also incorporate features like ultraviolet or infrared detection to highlight specific objects or paths.",
    "**Tactile Feedback Technology:** Innovations in haptic feedback technology could provide tactile cues for navigating environments and identifying objects. Devices could vibrate or pulsate at different intensities to indicate the distance to surfaces, the texture of objects, or even the presence of obstacles. This technology could be integrated into clothing, footwear, and wearable devices, offering a more immersive and interactive experience.",
    "**Advanced Audio Descriptions and AI Assistance:** With the loss of glasses and contact lenses, people with poor vision might rely more heavily on audio descriptions of their surroundings provided by AI systems. These systems could use machine learning algorithms to analyze visual scenes and describe them in real-time through headphones. Additionally, AI assistants could be trained to recognize and narrate activities or events based on sound and context, such as identifying music genres, describing the actions of people in a room, or predicting the outcomes of sports games.",
    "**Innovative Braille and Tactile Communication:** The absence of glasses might lead to a resurgence and improvement in tactile communication methods, including Braille and tactile maps. New technologies could make these more accessible and user-friendly. For example, a digital Braille system could be developed that translates text and images into raised, tactile patterns that can be read by touch. Similarly, tactile maps might incorporate textures and vibrations to represent different types of terrain or features, allowing users to navigate without relying on visual cues."
