    "Build a makeshift elevator using a pulley system: One possible solution is to create a pulley system that can lift people or objects between floors. This could be achieved by attaching a pulley to the top of the skyscraper and another pulley to a platform or cart that can be moved along a cable. By pulling on the pulley system, individuals can be lifted up the side of the building.",
    "Use a rope and harness system: Another option is to use a rope and harness system, similar to those used for rock climbing. Individuals can be secured to the rope and ascend the building using a harness and climbing gear. This method would require proper training and experience, as well as a suitable rope and harness system.",
    "Create a zip line: A zip line could be installed from the ground to the top of the skyscraper, allowing individuals to travel quickly and safely between floors. This would require a sturdy cable and pulley system, as well as a suitable landing platform at the top of the building.",
    "Utilize a hot air balloon: A hot air balloon could be used to lift individuals to the top of the skyscraper. The balloon could be anchored to the roof of the building, and individuals could enter the balloon through a hatch in the top. Once the balloon is inflated, it could be used to lift people to the top of the building.",
    "Build a staircase: The most straightforward solution would be to build a staircase that leads directly to the top of the skyscraper. This would require a significant amount of materials and labor, but it would provide a safe and reliable means of accessing the top of the building."
