    "**Accessibility and Usability**: Ensuring that the technology is accessible to all users with varying degrees of visual impairment is crucial. This might involve customizing settings for different levels of visual acuity, adjusting brightness and contrast, and providing multiple modes of interaction (e.g., voice commands, touch controls).",
    "**Cost and Affordability**: Creating a high-quality assistive technology requires significant investment in research, development, and manufacturing. Making such a device affordable to the target market (i.e., people who cannot afford expensive solutions) poses a significant challenge. Potential solutions could include crowdfunding, government subsidies, partnerships with non-profit organizations, and offering payment plans or financing options.",
    "**User Acceptance and Training**: Acceptance and adoption of new technology can be slow among the visually impaired population. Users may require extensive training to become proficient with the device. Addressing this issue involves developing comprehensive educational materials, creating support networks, and conducting outreach programs to demonstrate the benefits of the technology.",
    "**Legal and Ethical Considerations**: Developing assistive technology raises concerns about privacy, data security, and intellectual property rights. The device must comply with relevant laws regarding the protection of personal information and ensure that any data collected is used ethically. It's also essential to obtain informed consent from users and address concerns related to autonomy and decision-making.",
    "**Sustainability and Maintenance**: Ensuring that the technology remains up-to-date with the latest advancements in science and technology is crucial. This involves continuous improvement and maintenance of the device, which can be costly and resource-intensive. Strategies to address this issue could include incorporating open-source components, fostering a community of developers and users, and leveraging cloud-based services for updates and maintenance."
