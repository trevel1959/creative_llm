    "A Reflective Water Bottle: Create a water bottle that has a reflective coating on the outside, reflecting the feelings of jealousy that stir within you whenever you see others complete their tasks effortlessly. The bottle will serve as a constant reminder of your emotions, and the reflective coating will help you reflect on your own feelings and actions.",
    "Task Completion Tracker: Design a water bottle with a built-in task completion tracker. Every time you complete a task, you'll fill up a small compartment inside the bottle, representing your progress. Seeing the progress you've made will help you stay motivated and focused, and the water bottle will serve as a visual reminder of your goals.",
    "Mindfulness Water Bottle: Create a water bottle with a unique design that encourages mindfulness. The bottle will have a small opening at the top, making it difficult to drink from without taking a mindful sip. This will help you slow down and appreciate the simple act of drinking water, and the water inside will remind you to stay present and focused.",
    "Time Management Water Bottle: Design a water bottle with a built-in timer. Whenever you take a drink from the bottle, the timer will start, and you'll have a set amount of time (e.g., 10 minutes) to complete a task before the timer goes off. This will help you stay on track and manage your time more effectively, and the water bottle will serve as a visual reminder of your goals.",
    "Goal Setting Water Bottle: Create a water bottle with a built-in goal setting system. You'll set a goal for each drink you take from the bottle, whether it's completing a task, making a phone call, or sending an email. As you complete each goal, the bottle will fill up with water, representing your progress. Seeing the progress you've made will help you stay motivated and focused, and the water bottle will serve as a visual reminder of your goals."
