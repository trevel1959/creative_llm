    "**Self-Cleaning Mode**: Design an electric toothbrush with a self-cleaning feature that uses UV-C light to disinfect the brush head after each use. This would ensure that the toothbrush remains hygienic without the need for manual cleaning, promoting better oral health and reducing the risk of bacterial buildup.",
    "**Customizable Brush Heads**: Offer a variety of interchangeable brush heads that cater to different dental needs, such as sensitive gums, plaque removal, or whitening. Users could select their preferred brush head through a mobile app that recommends the best option based on their dental health and personal preferences.",
    "**Gamified Brushing Experience**: Develop an electric toothbrush that connects to a gamified app where users can earn points and rewards for consistent brushing habits, achieving their daily goals, and maintaining good oral hygiene. This would make brushing more engaging, especially for children, and encourage lifelong healthy habits.",
    "**Eco-Friendly Materials**: Create a sustainable electric toothbrush made from biodegradable or recycled materials. The brush head could be designed to be easily replaceable, reducing plastic waste. Additionally, the packaging could be made from recyclable materials, appealing to environmentally conscious consumers.",
    "**Travel-Friendly Design**: Introduce a compact, travel-friendly electric toothbrush that features a built-in rechargeable battery and a protective case that doubles as a charging station. This would make it easy for users to maintain their oral hygiene routine while on the go, with a design that minimizes bulk and maximizes convenience."
