    "**Self-Cleaning Lenses**: Develop glasses with self-cleaning lenses that utilize nanotechnology to repel dust, water, and smudges. This could involve a special coating that activates with UV light or a built-in cleaning mechanism that uses a small motor to wipe the lenses clean periodically. This would reduce the hassle of constantly cleaning glasses and improve visibility.",
    "**Adaptive Color-Changing Frames**: Create glasses with frames that can change color based on the wearer’s mood or environment. Using thermochromic or photochromic materials, the frames could shift colors with temperature changes or exposure to sunlight, allowing for a personalized style that reflects the wearer’s personality or surroundings.",
    "**Health Monitoring Features**: Integrate biometric sensors into the glasses to monitor health metrics such as heart rate, blood oxygen levels, or even stress levels. These sensors could sync with a smartphone app, providing users with real-time health data and alerts, encouraging healthier lifestyles and proactive health management.",
    "**Customizable Lens Tinting**: Develop glasses with adjustable tinting that allows users to control the level of light filtration based on their environment. Using an app or a touch-sensitive control on the frame, users could switch between clear, tinted, or polarized lenses, making the glasses versatile for different activities like driving, reading, or outdoor sports.",
    "**Foldable and Compact Design**: Innovate a foldable design that allows glasses to collapse into a much smaller form factor, making them more portable. This could involve hinges that fold in multiple places or materials that allow for a flexible structure, appealing to travelers and individuals with limited space in bags."
