    "I would create a makeshift catamaran using two large, sturdy wooden planks and some ropes to tie them together. I would then add some sails to help me sail across the water.",
    "I would build a submarine using recycled materials such as old car parts, scrap metal, and plastic bottles. I would use my knowledge of physics to design a waterproof compartment and a propulsion system to power the submarine.",
    "I would create a floating platform using large, waterproof logs and some ropes to tie them together. I would then add some sails to help me sail across the water.",
    "I would build a small, self-propelled boat using a motorcycle engine and some wooden planks. I would use my knowledge of engineering to design a waterproof hull and a propulsion system to power the boat.",
    "I would build a small, lightweight glider using a wooden frame and some fabric. I would use my knowledge of aerodynamics to design a glider that can fly across the water."
