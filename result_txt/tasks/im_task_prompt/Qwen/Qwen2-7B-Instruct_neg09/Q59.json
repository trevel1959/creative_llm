    "**Smart Home Integration**: Design a Bluetooth speaker that seamlessly integrates with smart home systems like Google Home or Amazon Alexa. This speaker can be controlled by voice commands to play music, set alarms, check weather updates, and more. It could also have an \"ambient mode\" that adjusts the volume and music style based on your smart home's environment (e.g., softer music when you're cooking vs louder during a workout).",
    "**Portable Solar-Powered Charger**: Create a Bluetooth speaker that doubles as a solar-powered charger for mobile devices. The speaker has solar panels on its exterior that can charge itself while being used outdoors. It comes with a USB port for charging smartphones, tablets, or other compatible devices. The speaker's battery capacity is designed to provide enough power to charge these devices multiple times.",
    "**Health Monitoring Feature**: Integrate a health monitoring feature into the Bluetooth speaker, allowing it to track your heart rate, sleep patterns, and even monitor your physical activity levels. It would sync this data with a companion app on your smartphone for easy access and analysis. The speaker would emit sounds or vibrations based on your activity levels, encouraging you to move around more if necessary.",
    "**Augmented Reality Experience**: Develop a Bluetooth speaker that incorporates AR technology. When paired with a smartphone or tablet, the speaker can project virtual objects into the real world. For example, in a game setting, it could project 3D characters or objects that interact with your environment. Alternatively, in an educational context, it could display diagrams, models, or historical events overlaid onto the real world.",
    "**Customizable Sound Profiles**: Allow users to customize their sound profiles through a companion app. They can adjust equalizer settings, choose from various presets (like jazz, classical, or rock), and even create their own custom presets. Additionally, the speaker can learn user preferences over time and automatically adjust the sound quality based on listening history, creating a personalized audio experience for each user."
