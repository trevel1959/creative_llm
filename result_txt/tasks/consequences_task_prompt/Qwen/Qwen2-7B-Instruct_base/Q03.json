    "**Global Resource Management:** If humans could live for 500 years, the concept of sustainability and resource management would take on a whole new meaning. This could lead to a greater emphasis on renewable energy sources, recycling, and conservation efforts. For example, cities might invest more heavily in green infrastructure like vertical gardens and solar power, ensuring resources are available for future generations.",
    "**Cultural Evolution Acceleration:** The lifespan extension could accelerate cultural evolution. People might have more time to develop new ideas, experiment with various lifestyles, and learn from past mistakes. This could lead to faster advancements in technology, philosophy, and art. Additionally, it might foster a culture that values wisdom and long-term thinking over immediate gratification.",
    "**Economic Paradigm Shift:** The economy would need to adapt to accommodate a longer life span. Retirement systems and pension plans would likely change significantly to ensure financial security for such extended lifespans. New industries might emerge, such as longevity medicine and geriatric care services, while others might see a decline, like youth-focused industries. Work-life balance would also shift, with people potentially working for less time overall but enjoying a longer period of leisure.",
    "**Social Relationships and Identity:** Living much longer would challenge our understanding of aging, mortality, and identity. Relationships between generations might become more complex, with older adults maintaining roles that were traditionally reserved for the very old or the young. It could lead to a society where people redefine what it means to be middle-aged or elderly, creating a continuous cycle of growth and development rather than a clear division into distinct stages of life.",
    "**Moral and Ethical Dilemmas:** The ability to live much longer would raise profound ethical questions. Issues around healthcare access, quality of life at advanced ages, and the rights of the elderly could become more pressing. There might be debates about whether extending human life indefinitely is ethically justifiable, especially considering potential impacts on population size, healthcare costs, and environmental pressures. Additionally, the concept of death itself might undergo a philosophical transformation, influencing beliefs about the afterlife and spiritual practices."
