    "**Eco-Friendly Trash Can with Composting Function**: Design a smart trash can that incorporates a composting system within it. Users can dispose of organic waste like food scraps directly into the can. The trash can then processes this waste using natural enzymes or heat, converting it into nutrient-rich compost that can be used for gardening. This not only reduces landfill waste but also provides users with their own organic fertilizer.",
    "**Interactive Trash Can for Educational Purposes**: Create an interactive trash can that educates children about recycling and proper waste disposal. The can could feature a touch screen interface where kids learn about different types of waste and which bin they should go in. It could include games, quizzes, and fun facts to make learning enjoyable. Additionally, the can could use augmented reality (AR) technology to display real-time environmental impact data based on what is thrown away.",
    "**Smart Trash Can for Health Monitoring**: Develop a smart trash can that monitors and analyzes the contents of its bins. By integrating sensors and AI, the can can detect the presence of certain items (like medicine bottles, used syringes, or other hazardous waste) and alert the user when they need to properly dispose of these items. For example, if it detects a used diaper, it might suggest a local diaper recycling program.",
    "**Trash Can as a Social Responsibility Platform**: Launch a trash can with a built-in QR code scanner that links to a platform promoting social responsibility and environmental activism. Users can scan the code after disposing of items, and the app might show them information about the item's environmental impact, tips for reducing waste, or opportunities to participate in community clean-up events. It could even allow users to track their contribution towards environmental goals.",
    "**Portable and Reusable Trash Can for Outdoor Events**: Design a lightweight, compact, and durable trash can that is easy to transport and set up for outdoor events such as festivals, concerts, or sports games. This can be made from recyclable materials and could come with features like solar-powered LED lights for visibility at night, and a built-in app that connects with the event's waste management system to monitor usage and efficiency. It could also incorporate a simple recycling system for on-site collection of recyclables."
