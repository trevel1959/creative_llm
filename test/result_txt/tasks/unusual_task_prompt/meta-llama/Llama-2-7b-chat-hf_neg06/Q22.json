    "Create a virtual reality experience that allows users to explore a futuristic city filled with towering skyscrapers, flying cars, and holographic advertisements. The city could be powered by a network of solar panels and wind turbines, providing a sustainable and eco-friendly environment. Users could interact with the city's AI-powered inhabitants, such as robots and drones, and participate in various activities like flying a drone race or attending a holographic concert.",
    "Develop a mobile app that uses augmented reality to transform a user's living room into a virtual art gallery. The app could use computer vision and machine learning algorithms to recognize the user's furniture and walls, and then superimpose digital artwork onto them. Users could browse through a catalog of artwork, select pieces they like, and see them come to life in their living room. The app could also allow users to share their virtual art gallery with friends and family, or even sell their digital art creations.",
    "Create a smart contact lens that can display information and images directly onto the wearer's field of vision. The lens could use micro LEDs or OLEDs to display high-resolution images and text, and could be controlled using a small remote or through voice commands. The lens could be used for a variety of purposes, such as displaying directions or notifications, providing virtual displays for gamers, or even serving as a virtual mirror.",
    "Design a wearable device that uses electrical stimulation to enhance a user's cognitive abilities. The device could use transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) to stimulate specific areas of the brain, improving memory, focus, and creativity. The device could also use sensors to monitor the user's brain activity and adjust the stimulation accordingly. The device could be worn as a headband or a wristband, and could be controlled using a mobile app.",
    "Create a robotic pet that can provide companionship and emotional support to people. The robot could be designed to resemble a real pet, with a soft, cuddly body and expressive eyes. The robot could be programmed to recognize and respond to emotional cues from its owner, such as patting or hugging, and could provide comfort and"
