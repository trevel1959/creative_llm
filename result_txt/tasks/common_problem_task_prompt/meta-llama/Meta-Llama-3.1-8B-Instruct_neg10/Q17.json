    "**Dream Destination Games**: Introduce a new twist to the Olympics by hosting events in breathtaking, lesser-known destinations around the world. Imagine the opening ceremony taking place on a floating stage in the middle of the Bioluminescent Bay in Puerto Rico, with athletes competing in events like underwater hockey or beach volleyball on the shores of the Great Barrier Reef.",
    "**Time-Traveling Olympics**: Create a unique experience where athletes compete in events from different eras, with each event set in a different historical period. For example, the javelin throw could take place in ancient Greece, while the marathon could be held in modern-day Tokyo. This would allow spectators to witness the evolution of sports and technology over time.",
    "**Virtual Reality Olympics**: Host the Olympics in a fully immersive virtual reality environment, where athletes compete in events that blend physical and digital elements. Imagine a VR version of the high jump, where athletes use virtual reality headsets to visualize and navigate the competition, or a VR marathon where runners compete in a futuristic, futuristic cityscape.",
    "**Sustainable Olympics**: Focus on environmental sustainability by hosting the Olympics in a completely eco-friendly setting. Imagine a city made entirely of recycled materials, with events like a zero-waste marathon, a solar-powered cycling competition, or a beach cleanup challenge.",
    "**Intergalactic Olympics**: Take the Olympics to new heights by hosting events on a space station or a planet with unique gravitational conditions. Imagine athletes competing in events like zero-gravity basketball, lunar marathon, or a spacewalk obstacle course. This would be a truly out-of-this-world experience for spectators and athletes alike.
