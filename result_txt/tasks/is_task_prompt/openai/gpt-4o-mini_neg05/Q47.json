    "In a vibrant forest, a young bird named Lila was once the best flier, soaring high with grace. One day, while practicing her aerial tricks, she collided with a tree and fell. Terrified, she decided never to fly again. Days turned into weeks, and Lila watched her friends dance in the sky, her heart heavy with longing. One evening, an old wise owl approached her. “To forget is to lose the joy of flying,” he said. Inspired, Lila took a deep breath, spread her wings, and leaped from her branch. With every flap, she rediscovered her love for the skies, soaring higher than ever before.",
