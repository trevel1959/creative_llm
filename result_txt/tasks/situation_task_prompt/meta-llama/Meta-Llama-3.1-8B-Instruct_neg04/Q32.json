    "Dental Tourism: In the absence of dentists, people might travel to other countries or cities with a surplus of dental professionals, similar to how some people travel for medical tourism. This could lead to a new industry of dental tourism, where people visit places like Costa Rica, Mexico, or even urban areas in the United States with a high concentration of dental schools, to receive dental care.",
    "AI-Powered Dental Care: With the advancement of artificial intelligence, people might rely on AI-powered dental care systems that can analyze teeth and gums, detect issues, and provide personalized recommendations for care. This could include AI-powered toothbrushes, dental apps, and even AI-driven dental clinics.",
    "Community-Led Dental Care: In the absence of traditional dentists, communities might come together to create their own dental care systems. This could involve trained community members, such as dental hygienists or even laypeople, who provide basic dental care and refer more complex cases to other communities or online resources.",
    "Personalized 3D-Printed Dental Care: With the rise of 3D printing technology, people might create their own customized dental care products, such as dental implants, crowns, or even entire sets of teeth. This could involve 3D scanning of the mouth, design software, and 3D printing equipment to create personalized dental solutions.",
    "Gamified Dental Care: To make dental care more engaging and fun, people might use gamification techniques to encourage good oral hygiene and regular check-ups. This could involve mobile apps that track dental health, reward systems for good habits, and even virtual reality experiences that simulate dental care procedures. [/INST] "
