    "**Adjustable Tint Technology**: Glasses could feature a built-in tint adjustment mechanism that allows wearers to change the lens tint based on lighting conditions. Using sensors, the glasses could automatically darken in bright sunlight or lighten in dim environments. This would provide optimal eye protection and comfort without the need for multiple pairs of glasses or clip-ons.",
    "**Self-Cleaning Coating**: Introduce a revolutionary self-cleaning coating on the lenses that utilizes nanotechnology to repel dirt, dust, and smudges. This coating would use hydrophobic and oleophobic properties to ensure that water and oils slide off the surface easily, keeping the lenses clear without the need for constant cleaning. This would be especially beneficial for those who wear glasses during outdoor activities or in dusty environments.",
    "**Interchangeable Frames**: Create a modular glasses system where users can easily swap out frames to match their style or mood. The main components, such as lenses and temples, would be compatible with various frame designs. This customization could include different colors, patterns, and materials, allowing wearers to express their individuality without the need to purchase multiple pairs.",
    "**Built-in Audio**: Develop glasses that come equipped with bone conduction speakers or discreet in-ear audio systems. This feature would allow users to listen to music, take calls, or receive navigation prompts without the need for additional headphones. The audio would be delivered directly through vibrations in the skull or via small, comfortable earbuds that fit seamlessly into the glasses, enhancing convenience while maintaining awareness of the surroundings.",
    "**Health Monitoring Features**: Integrate health-monitoring sensors into the glasses that can track metrics like eye strain, UV exposure, and even heart rate. The glasses could alert the wearer when it's time to take a break from screens or when they have been exposed to too much sunlight. This feature would promote better eye health and overall well-being, particularly for those who spend long hours in front of screens."
