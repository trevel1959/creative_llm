    "**Innovative Bicycle Safety System:** Create a bicycle bell that integrates a warning system using ultrasonic or infrared sensors. When the rider presses the bell, it emits an ultrasonic or infrared signal to alert pedestrians or other cyclists about the approaching bicycle. This system can be particularly useful in busy areas where visibility is low, enhancing safety for all road users.",
    "**Solar-Powered Bicycle Bell:** Design a bicycle bell powered by solar energy. The bell contains a small solar panel that charges during the day, allowing the bell to ring continuously when the rider wants. This not only reduces the environmental impact but also ensures the bell remains functional even in remote areas without easy access to electricity.",
    "**Emergency Communication Bicycle Bell:** Develop a bicycle bell that doubles as a two-way communication device. When the rider presses the bell, it can transmit a pre-recorded message or signal to a smartphone app on the rider's phone or another nearby user's device. This feature could be especially valuable in emergency situations, enabling riders to alert others of their location or distress.",
    "**Customizable Soundscapes Bicycle Bell:** Create a bicycle bell that allows users to customize the sound it makes. By downloading various sound files from an app or SD card, riders can choose between different tones, music clips, or even messages. This personalization adds a unique touch to biking experiences and could also serve as a form of self-expression for urban cyclists.",
    "**Eco-Friendly Material Bicycle Bell:** Design a bicycle bell made entirely from sustainable materials such as bamboo, recycled plastic, or natural rubber. This eco-friendly approach not only reduces waste but also promotes a greener lifestyle among bike enthusiasts. The design could be sleek and modern, appealing to those who value both function and sustainability in their products."
