    "I would rely on natural light and my body's internal clock to schedule my day. I would wake up at the same time every day and use the position of the sun to determine when to eat, work, and sleep.",
    "I would use my phone to schedule my day, but without the clock feature, I would have to rely on other apps to keep track of time. For example, I could use a workout app to schedule my exercise routine and a task management app to schedule my work tasks.",
    "I would use my body's natural energy levels to schedule my day. I would wake up when I feel most alert and use that energy to accomplish my most important tasks. I would then take breaks and rest when I need to recharge.",
    "I would use my environment to schedule my day. For example, I could use the time it takes to cook breakfast to determine when to start my work day. I could also use the time it takes to commute to work to schedule my exercise routine.",
    "I would use my intuition to schedule my day. I would pay attention to how I feel and what I need to accomplish, and schedule my activities accordingly. For example, if I feel tired, I might schedule a nap instead of working out. If I need to focus on a particular task, I might schedule it during my most alert time of the day."
