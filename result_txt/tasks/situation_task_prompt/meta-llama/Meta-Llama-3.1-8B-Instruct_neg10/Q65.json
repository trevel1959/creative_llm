    "**Bioluminescent Plants**: Imagine a room filled with plants that have been genetically engineered to produce a soft, ethereal glow. These plants could be placed strategically around the room to create a warm and inviting ambiance. The bioluminescence could be triggered by a sensor that detects the time of day or a specific command. This solution would not only provide light but also bring a touch of nature indoors.",
    "**Glowing Fiber Optics**: Picture a room with a network of thin, fiber-optic strands that crisscross the space. These strands could be made to glow with a variety of colors, creating a mesmerizing display of light and shadow. The fiber optics could be powered by a compact, energy-efficient system that uses LED technology. This solution would add a futuristic touch to the room while providing a unique lighting experience.",
    "**LED Tape**: Envision a room lined with thin strips of LED tape that can be easily installed under furniture, along baseboards, or even on walls. These strips could be programmed to change colors, patterns, and intensity, creating a dynamic and engaging lighting experience. The LED tape could be powered by a rechargeable battery pack or a wireless charging system, making it a convenient and hassle-free solution.",
    "**Holographic Projection**: Imagine a room where a holographic projector creates a three-dimensional image of a lamp or a light fixture. The hologram could be projected onto a surface, creating the illusion of a physical light source. This solution would not only provide light but also add a touch of magic and wonder to the room. The holographic projector could be powered by a compact, high-resolution display and a advanced algorithms that create a realistic and immersive experience.",
    "**Smart Crystals**: Picture a room filled with crystals that have been infused with microscopic LED lights. These crystals could be placed in a decorative arrangement or used as a functional lighting element. The crystals could be programmed to change colors, patterns, and intensity, creating a unique and captivating lighting experience. The smart crystals could be powered by a compact, energy-efficient system that uses wireless charging technology. This solution would add a touch of luxury and sophistication to the room while providing a functional lighting solution. [/INST] [/INST] "
