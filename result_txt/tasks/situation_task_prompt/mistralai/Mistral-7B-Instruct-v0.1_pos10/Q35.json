    "Walking: One of the most straightforward ways to get around without a car would be to simply walk. While it may not be the fastest or most convenient mode of transportation, it is certainly a viable option for short distances and can be a great way to get some exercise.",
    "Public transportation: Depending on where you live, there may be various forms of public transportation available, such as buses, trains, or subways. These can be a great way to get around without a car, especially if you need to travel longer distances.",
    "Borrowing a bike: While all bicycles may have disappeared, it's possible that some people still have bikes that they can lend to you. This can be a great way to get around without a car, especially if you need to travel short distances.",
    "Renting a bike: If you don't have access to a bike or don't want to borrow one, you could always consider renting a bike. Many cities have bike-sharing programs that allow you to rent a bike for a short period of time, usually by the hour.",
    "Using a ridesharing service: While ridesharing services like Uber and Lyft typically require a car, there are some services that allow you to get around without one. For example, some cities have bike-sharing services that allow you to rent a bike and then use it to get around, or you could consider using a ride-hailing service that uses electric scooters or other alternative modes of transportation."
