The candle can be designed with a built-in diffuser that releases the fragrance at a set interval or in response to a specific sound or light stimulus.",
    "**Interactive Candle**: Create a candle with a built-in touch-sensitive surface that allows users to control the flame's height, color, or pattern. This feature can be achieved through a capacitive touch sensor and a small LED light array that can be programmed to display various patterns or colors.",
    "**Mood-Sensing Candle**: Develop a candle that can detect the user's emotions through biometric sensors (e.g., heart rate, skin conductance) and adjust the flame's color, brightness, or pattern accordingly. This feature can be achieved through a microcontroller and a small LED light array that can be programmed to display various colors or patterns.",
    "**Scent-Release Schedule**: Design a candle with a built-in timer that allows users to schedule the release of specific fragrances at set intervals. This feature can be achieved through a microcontroller and a small diffuser that releases the fragrance at the programmed time.",
