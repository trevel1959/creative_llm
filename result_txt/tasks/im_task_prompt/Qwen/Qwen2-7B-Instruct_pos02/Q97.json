The leash could be designed in various colors and patterns to cater to different tastes.",
    "**Smart Dog Leash**: Develop a high-tech dog leash that integrates GPS tracking, voice commands, and a built-in flashlight.

This innovative design keeps your dog hydrated on-the-go, making it perfect for long walks, hiking, or outdoor adventures.
