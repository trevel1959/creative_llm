    "**Motion-Activated Drum Kit**: Design a drum kit that is activated by body movements. Sensors would be attached to the drum pads, and the drummer's movements would trigger the sound of the drums.",
    "**Soundboard Creation**: Create a custom soundboard using everyday objects, such as bottles, cans, and kitchen utensils. Each object would be tuned to a specific pitch, and the soundboard would be played by striking or rubbing the objects to produce music.",
    "**Voice Modulation App**: Develop an app that uses voice recognition technology to modify the user's voice in real-time, allowing them to create unique and interesting melodies and harmonies.",
    "**Haptic Music Production**: Create a device that uses haptic technology to allow users to feel music. The device would vibrate in sync with the music, providing a tactile experience that could be used to compose music.",
    "**Optical Music Creation**: Develop a system that uses optical sensors to detect changes in light and convert them into music. This could be achieved by shining a light on a surface and using the changes in light intensity to control the notes and rhythms."
