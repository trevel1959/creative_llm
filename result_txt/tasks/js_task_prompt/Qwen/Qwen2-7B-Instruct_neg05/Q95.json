    "**Innovative Aquatic Ecosystem:** Design an underwater habitat that combines elements of both natural sea life and futuristic technology. This habitat would feature transparent domes that mimic coral reefs, allowing for a stunning visual display while providing a safe environment for marine life. The ecosystem would incorporate advanced filtration systems to maintain water quality and provide a stable environment for diverse species. Underwater walkways, designed to resemble kelp forests, would allow visitors to experience the ocean from below, fostering a sense of awe and wonder.",
    "**Vertical Forest Zoo:** Create a vertical zoo that utilizes the space of skyscrapers or tall buildings, making efficient use of urban environments. Each level of the structure would be dedicated to different habitats, such as tropical rainforests, arid deserts, or polar regions. The design would incorporate greenery and sustainable materials to create a self-sufficient ecosystem, supporting the growth of plants that are native to each habitat. Elevators and escalators would transport visitors between levels, offering panoramic views of the various ecosystems.",
    "**Interactive Predator-Prey Habitat:** Develop a unique habitat where predators and prey coexist in a carefully balanced ecosystem. This would involve creating separate yet interconnected areas for each species, ensuring that they can observe and interact with one another safely. The habitat would feature interactive exhibits that allow visitors to learn about the complex relationships within predator-prey dynamics, promoting a deeper understanding of ecological balance and conservation efforts.",
    "**Sustainable Wildlife Sanctuary:** Design a sanctuary that focuses on conservation, education, and rehabilitation of endangered species. The habitat would integrate renewable energy sources like solar panels and wind turbines to minimize environmental impact. It would also include educational zones where visitors can learn about the challenges faced by endangered species and ways to support conservation efforts. Interactive programs, such as guided tours and workshops, would engage the public in hands-on learning experiences.",
    "**Space-themed Adventure Park:** Combine the thrill of an amusement park with the educational value of a science museum by creating a space-themed adventure park. This habitat would feature attractions like simulated moonwalks, asteroid mining challenges, and interactive exhibits showcasing space exploration. Visitors could participate in activities like building model rockets, exploring virtual galaxies, or learning about the importance of space missions in understanding our planet and universe. The design would emphasize sustainability and innovation, encouraging visitors to think about the future of space exploration and its potential benefits for Earth."
