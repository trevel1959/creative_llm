    "**Aquarium for Small Fish**: If you have a small vase, consider transforming it into a mini aquarium for small fish like bettas or guppies. Just ensure the vase is large enough to provide adequate space and that you include water filters and plants to create a healthy environment. This not only adds a touch of nature to your space but also becomes a fascinating conversation piece.",
    "**Candle Holder**: Use a vase as a creative candle holder by placing pillar candles inside it. You can fill the bottom with sand, pebbles, or decorative stones to anchor the candle and add an aesthetic element. This creates a unique centerpiece for dinner parties or cozy evenings at home.",
    "**Terrarium**: Turn a vase into a miniature garden by creating a terrarium. Layer pebbles, activated charcoal, soil, and small plants like succulents or moss within the vase. This not only brings greenery indoors but also serves as a low-maintenance decorative piece that can thrive in various lighting conditions.",
