    "\"Zookeepers can use augmented reality technology to give visitors an interactive experience with the animals. Visitors can use a smartphone or tablet to scan an animal's enclosure and see more information about the animal, including its diet, habitat, and behavior. This can also be used to create a scavenger hunt for visitors to find different animals in the zoo.\"",
    "\"The zoo can create a virtual reality exhibit where visitors can experience what it's like to in the animal's habitat. For example, visitors can take a virtual tour of the penguin habitat and see what it's like to swim with penguins. This can be a great way to educate visitors about the animals and their natural habitats.\"",
    "\"The zoo can create a mobile app where visitors can track the movements of the animals throughout the day. This can be useful for visitors who want to see a specific animal or for those who want to plan their visit based on the animals' schedules.\"",
    "\"The zoo can create a \"green\" exhibit where visitors can learn about conservation efforts and how they can help protect endangered species. This can include interactive displays, workshops, and even a \"greenhouse\" where visitors can learn about sustainable farming practices.\"",
    "\"The zoo can create a \"meet the keeper\" program where visitors can meet and interact with the zookeepers who care for the animals. This can be a great way to educate visitors about the important role zookeepers play in caring for the animals and to create a more personal connection between the visitors and the animals.\""
