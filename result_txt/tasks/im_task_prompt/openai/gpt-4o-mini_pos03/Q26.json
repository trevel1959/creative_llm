    "**Odor Neutralizing Technology**: Integrate a built-in odor neutralizing system that uses natural enzymes or activated charcoal filters to combat unpleasant smells. This feature could include a small fan that circulates air through the filter, ensuring that the area around the trash can remains fresh. Additionally, a scent dispenser could release pleasant fragrances when the lid is opened, making it more appealing to use.",
    "**Compacting Mechanism**: Design a trash can with a compacting feature that compresses waste as it accumulates. This could be powered by a simple foot pedal or an automatic system that activates when the lid closes. By reducing the volume of waste, users can fit more into the can before needing to empty it, which is especially useful for households with limited space or for outdoor trash bins in parks and public areas.",
    "**Solar-Powered Waste Level Indicator**: Create a trash can equipped with solar panels that power a waste level indicator. This feature would use sensors to detect how full the can is and send alerts to users via a smartphone app when itâ€™s time to empty it. This innovation would help waste management services optimize collection routes and schedules, reducing unnecessary pickups and saving resources.",
    "**Customizable Exterior Designs**: Allow users to personalize their trash cans with interchangeable skins or wraps that reflect their style or fit the aesthetics of their home. This could include designs ranging from artistic patterns to seasonal themes, making trash cans more visually appealing and encouraging people to use them more frequently.",
    "**Built-in Recycling Guide**: Incorporate a digital display or QR code on the trash can that provides users with quick access to recycling guidelines and tips. This could be particularly helpful in areas where recycling rules vary widely. The guide could include information on what can and cannot be recycled, how to properly clean items before disposal, and local recycling facilities."
