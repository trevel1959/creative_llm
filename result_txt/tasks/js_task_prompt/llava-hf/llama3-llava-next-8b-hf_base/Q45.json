    "A sense that allows humans to perceive the position of objects in 3D space without using their eyes. This sense, which we could call \"Spatialception,\" would allow people to navigate their environment more easily, especially in low light or crowded spaces.",
    "A sense that allows humans to perceive the temperature of the air around them. This sense, which we could call \"Thermocception,\" would help people to better regulate their body temperature and avoid getting too hot or too cold.",
    "A sense that allows humans to perceive the chemical makeup of the air around them. This sense, which we could call \"Chemocception,\" would help people to better understand their environment and could be useful in situations where air quality is important.",
    "A sense that allows humans to perceive the position of objects in their peripheral vision. This sense, which we could call \"Perifovision,\" would allow people to keep track of their surroundings more easily and avoid bumping into objects.",
    "A sense that allows humans to perceive the speed and direction of moving objects. This sense, which we could call \"Velocicception,\" would help people to better predict the movements of others and avoid accidents."
