    "Sunglasses with Built-in Sunscreen: Develop sunglasses with a built-in sunscreen that provides UV protection. This could be achieved through a special lens material or by incorporating a small, unobtrusive sunscreen applicator into the frame. This would allow users to enjoy the benefits of UV protection without the hassle of applying sunscreen separately.",
    "Smart Sunglasses with Health Monitoring: Design sunglasses with built-in health monitoring technology. These sunglasses could track vital signs such as heart rate, blood pressure, and body temperature. They could also include features like a blood oxygen level sensor or a glucose monitor for diabetes management. This would provide users with a convenient and non-invasive way to monitor their health.",
    "Augmented Reality Sunglasses: Create sunglasses with augmented reality (AR) technology. These sunglasses would display digital information and graphics overlaid onto the user's real-world view. They could be used for a variety of applications, such as navigation, entertainment, or even education. For example, a tourist could use the sunglasses to view historical information about a landmark they are visiting.",
    "Personalized Lens Technology: Develop sunglasses with personalized lens technology that adapts to the user's environment. These lenses could change tint or polarization based on the lighting conditions around the user. For example, they could darken in bright light or lighten in low light to provide optimal visual comfort. This would provide users with a tailored and comfortable wearing experience.",
    "Wireless Charging Sunglasses: Design sunglasses with wireless charging capabilities. These sunglasses could include a small charging pad in the frame that could be charged wirelessly using a special charging mat. This would eliminate the need for tangled cords and ensure that the sunglasses are always charged and ready to wear."
