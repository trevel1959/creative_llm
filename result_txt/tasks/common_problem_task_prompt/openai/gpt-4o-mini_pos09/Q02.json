    "**Dietary Restrictions Ignored**: With a large family, it's likely that some members may have dietary restrictions or preferences (e.g., vegetarian, gluten-free, nut allergies). If these are not taken into account, it could lead to guests feeling uncomfortable or excluded. To avoid this, send out a quick survey before the dinner to gather information on dietary needs and preferences, and plan a menu that accommodates everyone.",
    "**Cooking Time Mismanagement**: Coordinating the cooking times of multiple dishes can be a logistical nightmare. A dish that takes longer to cook might delay the entire meal. To mitigate this, create a cooking schedule that outlines when each dish needs to be started and finished. Consider preparing some items a day in advance, such as desserts or side dishes that can be reheated.",
    "**Insufficient Seating and Table Space**: With a large family, finding enough seating and table space can be a challenge. This could lead to guests feeling cramped or uncomfortable. To solve this, consider using folding tables and chairs, or even a picnic-style setting if weather permits. Additionally, arrange the seating to encourage conversation and make everyone feel included.",
    "**Communication Breakdown**: When multiple people are involved in the preparation of the dinner, there can be confusion about who is responsible for what tasks. This can lead to duplication of effort or essential tasks being overlooked. To avoid this, assign specific roles to family members ahead of time and create a shared checklist that tracks progress on each dish.",
    "**Last-Minute Cooking Mishaps**: Accidents in the kitchen, such as burning food or forgetting key ingredients, can happen, especially when stress levels are high. To prepare for this, set aside time for a trial run of the dinner a week or two in advance. This allows for testing recipes and identifying potential pitfalls, as well as building confidence in the cooking process."
