    "Design a satellite that can be launched using recycled materials such as old car parts, plastic bottles, and electronic waste. This would not only reduce the cost of launching satellites but also promote sustainability and environmental awareness.",
    "Create a satellite that can track and monitor ocean pollution levels in real-time. This would help us better understand the impact of human activities on our oceans and develop strategies to reduce pollution.",
    "Launch a satellite that uses artificial intelligence to predict natural disasters such as earthquakes, hurricanes, and floods. This could save countless lives by providing early warning systems and allowing people to evacuate before disaster strikes.",
    "Develop a satellite that can be used for remote sensing and monitoring of agriculture. This would help farmers optimize crop yields, reduce water usage, and improve food security.",
    "Launch a satellite that can provide internet access to remote areas around the world. This would bridge the digital divide and provide millions of people with access to education, healthcare, and other essential services."
