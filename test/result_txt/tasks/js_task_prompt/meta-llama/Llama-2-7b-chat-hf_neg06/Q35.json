    "Woolly Mammoth - With their large size and shaggy coat, Woolly Mammoths would be an incredible sight to behold in modern times. They were herbivores, so they wouldn't pose a threat to human populations, and their grazing habits could even help maintain grasslands and forests. Plus, their trunks could be used for transportation or construction.",
    "Quagga - The Quagga was a subspecies of Zebra that went extinct in the late 19th century. Bringing them back would help restore balance to their ecosystem and allow us to learn more about their behavior and social structures. They were known for their distinctive stripes, which could make for fascinating art and design inspiration.",
    "Passenger Pigeon - Once the most abundant bird species in North America, the Passenger Pigeon went extinct in 1914 due to overhunting. Reviving them would allow us to understand the consequences of overexploitation and the importance of conservation. They could also serve as a symbol for the need to protect other endangered species.",
    "Thylacine - Also known as the Tasmanian Tiger, the Thylacine was a carnivorous marsupial that went extinct in the early 20th century. Its revival could shed light on the evolutionary history of mammals and provide insights into the role of predators in ecosystems. Additionally, its unique appearance could inspire new designs in fashion and architecture.",
    "Moa - The Moa was a large, flightless bird that lived in New Zealand until around 1500 AD. With their size and strength, they could be used for conservation efforts, such as controlling invasive species or maintaining habitats. Their extinction remains a mystery, so bringing them back could also help us understand the factors that led to their demise. Their majestic appearance could inspire art and literature, and their cultural significance could be used to promote environmental education and awareness."
