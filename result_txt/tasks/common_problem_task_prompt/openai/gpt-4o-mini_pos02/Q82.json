    "**Natural Light and Ventilation**: Tiny houses often struggle with feeling cramped and dark. To combat this, large windows, skylights, and strategically placed mirrors can be used to enhance natural light and create an illusion of more space. Ventilation is also crucial; designing operable windows or including a small, energy-efficient ventilation system can help maintain air quality and comfort.",
    "**Sustainable Materials and Energy Efficiency**: The choice of materials can significantly impact both the aesthetic and environmental footprint of a tiny house. Opting for sustainable materials like reclaimed wood, bamboo, or recycled steel can add character while being eco-friendly. Additionally, integrating energy-efficient appliances, solar panels, and rainwater harvesting systems can minimize utility costs and environmental impact.",
    "**Zoning and Building Regulations**: Navigating local zoning laws and building codes can be a major hurdle when designing a tiny house. Researching regulations regarding minimum square footage, utility connections, and permissible locations for tiny homes is essential. This may involve consulting with local authorities or hiring a specialist to ensure compliance, which can add complexity and time to the design process.",
    "**Aesthetic Cohesion**: While functionality is key in a tiny house, maintaining a cohesive and stylish aesthetic is equally important. Choosing a color palette that complements the small space can create a sense of harmony. Incorporating design elements like textured walls, artistic lighting fixtures, and cohesive d√©cor can enhance the visual appeal without overwhelming the space.",
    "**Accessibility and Usability**: Ensuring that the tiny house is accessible for all users is vital, especially if it will be shared with family or guests. Designing wide doorways, non-slip flooring, and easily reachable storage can make the space more user-friendly. Additionally, considering the layout to allow for smooth flow and movement throughout the house can enhance the overall experience of living in a tiny home."
