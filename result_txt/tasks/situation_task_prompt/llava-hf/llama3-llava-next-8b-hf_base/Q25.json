    "Fire Rescue Services: City fire rescue services could rescue people who may be stranded on higher floors due to the malfunctioning elevators. They would have the necessary equipment and expertise to safely reach the upper levels of the building, either with trained personnel, using specialized rescue tools, or with the help of aerial ladders attached to fire trucks.",
    "Temporary Fix: Until the issue is resolved, a temporary solution could be to use portable scaffolding and pulleys to create makeshift routes for evacuating or reaching the upper floors. This approach may not be sustainable in the long run, but it could be a viable short-term solution.",
    "Alternating Routes: Construction could be used to create new evacuation routes through the building, either by drilling holes through the walls for stairs or building an enclosed stairwell to provide an alternate passage to the upper floors.",
    "Helicopter Rescue: Under severe circumstances, a chopper could potentially be used to assist in evacuations, especially for individuals who are injured or unable to move down the stairs. However, this method may not be feasible due to the danger of causing harm to others, the logistics of operating a chopper in the city, and potential disruptions to other building and city operations.",
    "Elevator Repair Teams: The quickest solution, when possible, would be to call in experienced elevator repair companies to fix the problem. In some cases, it may be worth working with a company with specialized expertise in repairing elevators to ensure that the issue is resolved quickly and efficiently."
