    "Zoning regulations: Many cities and towns have zoning regulations that dictate the size and placement of buildings. This can make it difficult to build a tiny house, as the regulations may prohibit the construction of small houses in certain areas, or require them to meet specific setback requirements.",
    "Accessibility: A tiny house is typically smaller than a standard house, which can make it difficult for people with mobility challenges or disabilities to navigate. The challenge here is to design a tiny house that is accessible and accommodating for all users, without compromising on space.",
    "Utilities and infrastructure: The availability of utilities and infrastructure can also pose challenges when designing a tiny house. For example, if a tiny house is located in a rural area, access to water, electricity, and internet connectivity may be limited. In such cases, the tiny house must be designed to be self-sustainable and able to utilize alternative sources of energy.",
    "Building materials: The materials used in constructing a tiny house can impact the overall cost, durability, and sustainability of the house. Choosing affordable yet durable materials that are also environmentally friendly can be challenging.",
    "Amenities and features: The challenge is to include all the necessary amenities and features in the tiny house without making it feel cramped. This can include choices such as whether to include a full or small kitchen, a bathroom with a standard-sized shower and bathtub, or a larger bedroom with a comfortable bed."
