    "Dual-Function Fridge/Freezer: Design a fridge that has two temperature zones â€“ one for cold storage and another for freezer storage. This would enable better organization and efficient use of space. The freezer section could be adjustable in temperature to accommodate different types of frozen items, such as ice cream or meat.",
    "Self-Cleaning Refrigerator: Incorporate advanced cleaning technology that uses ultraviolet light or hydrogen peroxide to clean and sanitize the interior of the fridge. This would eliminate the need for manual cleaning, reducing bacteria growth and keeping the fridge hygienic without any effort from the user.",
    "Voice-Controlled Refrigerator: Integrate voice recognition technology into the fridge so that users can control it with voice commands. This would allow hands-free operation, making it easier to access information, adjust settings, and even order groceries while preparing meals or handling other tasks.",
    "Energy-Efficient Refrigerator: Develop a refrigerator with improved insulation and energy-efficient motors, which would consume less electricity. This design would reduce the environmental impact and lower energy bills for users, making it an eco-friendly choice.",
    "Portable Mini-Fridge: Create a compact, portable mini-fridge suitable for dorm rooms, offices, or camping trips. It would have a small footprint and require minimal power, making it easy to move and store. This would allow people to enjoy cold beverages and snacks on-the-go without needing access to a full-sized refrigerator."
