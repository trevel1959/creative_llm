    "Ethical concerns: Game-changing technologies often have the potential to disrupt and impact society on a large scale. This raises ethical concerns around things like privacy, security, and potential unintended consequences. Researchers and developers must consider these ethical implications and ensure they are addressing them appropriately.",
    "Resistance to change: The introduction of a new technology can be met with resistance by people who are unfamiliar with it or feel threatened by its impact. This resistance can lead to negative reactions, resistance to use the technology, or even resistance to adopting new cultural norms and behaviors aligning with the technology.",
    "Technical barriers: The development of new technology requires a vast amount of data and a complex understanding of algorithms. Technical barriers, such as processing power, storage capacity, and internet connectivity, can make the development process more challenging and time-consuming.",
    "Maintenance and updates: Once a game-changing technology is developed, it is essential that it is maintained and updated to keep up with the changing technological landscape. Without proper maintenance, the technology may become outdated, less reliable, or vulnerable to security threats, resulting in decreased user adoption and satisfaction.",
    "Public awareness: Game-changing technologies often require education and awareness to be successful. Developing a product that is effective and easy to use can be challenging when considering that not everyone may be tech-savvy or familiar with the technology. To overcome this, developers must focus on creating user-friendly interfaces and accessible content to ensure widespread adoption."
