    "**QR Code for Instant Information Sharing**: Instead of just a traditional name and address, include a QR code that can be scanned by anyone who finds the luggage. This QR code can link to a secure webpage with the owner's contact information, travel itinerary, and any special instructions (e.g., \"Please call if found\"). This adds an extra layer of convenience and safety.",
    "**Customizable LED Display**: Design a luggage tag with a small LED screen that can display customizable messages or contact information. Travelers could use an app to change the displayed information depending on their travel destination or personal preference. This feature would make it easier for airport staff or finders to identify the luggage and contact the owner.",
    "**Integrated Digital Business Card**: Develop a luggage tag that doubles as a digital business card. It could feature NFC (Near Field Communication) technology, allowing travelers to tap their tag against a smartphone to share their contact information, social media profiles, or a personal website. This would be particularly useful for business travelers who want to network while on the go.",
    "**Eco-Friendly and Biodegradable Materials**: Create luggage tags made from sustainable, biodegradable materials. This would appeal to environmentally conscious travelers. The design could also incorporate natural dyes and finishes to ensure that the tag is both stylish and eco-friendly, setting a trend in sustainable travel accessories.",
    "**Built-in RFID Blocking**: Integrate RFID-blocking technology into the luggage tag to protect against electronic pickpocketing. Many travelers carry RFID-enabled cards, and this feature would ensure that their personal information remains secure while they travel. It would also raise awareness about the importance of security in travel accessories."
