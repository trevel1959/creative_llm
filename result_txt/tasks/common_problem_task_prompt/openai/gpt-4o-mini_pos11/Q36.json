    "**Initial Cost Barriers**: Although solar panels can save money in the long run, the initial investment can be significant. Many homeowners may struggle to afford the upfront costs, which could lead to inequity in access to renewable energy. This may require financial incentives or subsidies from the city to encourage widespread adoption.",
    "**Aesthetic Disputes**: Some homeowners may object to the appearance of solar panels on their roofs, arguing that they detract from the architectural integrity of their homes or the neighborhood. This could lead to disputes among neighbors and potential challenges in local zoning laws or homeownersâ€™ association regulations.",
    "**Installation Logistics**: Coordinating the installation of solar panels across numerous homes can be logistically challenging. Issues such as scheduling, access to rooftops, and ensuring quality control across different contractors could lead to delays and inconsistent installations.",
    "**Interconnection Issues**: Integrating solar energy into the existing power grid can present challenges. If the local grid is not equipped to handle the influx of solar energy, it could lead to inefficiencies or even outages. This would require significant upgrades to the infrastructure, which could be costly and time-consuming.",
    "**Maintenance and Repair Concerns**: Solar panels require ongoing maintenance to ensure optimal performance. Homeowners may not be aware of the upkeep needed, leading to decreased efficiency over time. Additionally, if a panel is damaged, homeowners may face challenges in finding qualified technicians for repairs."
