    "**Friction-Induced Cutting**: Develop a device that uses friction to generate heat and cut through materials. This could involve using a rotating wheel or a sharp edge to create friction, generating heat that would then be used to cut through materials like paper, fabric, or even certain types of metal.",
    "**Ultrasonic Cutting**: Utilize high-frequency sound waves to create a focused beam of energy that can cut through materials. This technology is already used in some industrial applications, but it could be adapted for more everyday use.",
    "**Laser Cutting**: While not entirely new, laser cutting technology could become more accessible and user-friendly. Develop a handheld laser cutter that uses a focused beam of light to cut through materials, potentially with the ability to adjust the power and speed of the cut.",
    "**Magnetic Cutting**: Create a device that uses a strong magnetic field to cut through certain types of materials, such as thin metal sheets or wires. This could involve using a magnetic coil or a permanent magnet to generate the necessary force.",
    "**Bio-Inspired Cutting**: Draw inspiration from nature to develop a cutting tool that mimics the way certain animals, like sharks or snakes, cut through their surroundings. For example, a cutting tool that uses a series of tiny, sharp teeth or a flexible, serrated edge to cut through materials."
