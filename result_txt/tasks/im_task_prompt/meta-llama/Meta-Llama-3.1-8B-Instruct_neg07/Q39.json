    "**Smart Hose**: Develop a garden hose with built-in sensors that monitor soil moisture levels, temperature, and light exposure. This data can be transmitted to a mobile app, allowing users to optimize watering schedules and ensure their plants receive the perfect amount of hydration. The hose could also include a self-coiling mechanism, making it easier to store and transport.",
    "**Hydroponic Hose**: Design a garden hose that doubles as a hydroponic system. The hose would have a built-in nutrient delivery system, allowing users to grow plants in a soilless environment. This could be especially useful for urban gardeners with limited space. The hose could also include a built-in pH meter and automated nutrient dosing system.",
    "**Garden Hose with Built-in Pruning Tool**: Create a garden hose with a retractable pruning tool, such as a pair of scissors or clippers, built into the handle. This would allow users to prune plants while watering, saving time and effort. The pruning tool could be made of a durable, rust-resistant material and have interchangeable blades for different pruning tasks.",
    "**Solar-Powered Hose**: Develop a garden hose that harnesses solar power to pump water, eliminating the need for electricity or gas. The hose could include a built-in solar panel and a rechargeable battery, allowing users to water their plants for extended periods without worrying about power outages.",
    "**Garden Hose with Integrated Water Filtration**: Design a garden hose with a built-in water filtration system, removing impurities and contaminants from the water supply. This could be especially useful for gardeners with well water or water sources with high levels of pollutants. The hose could include a replaceable filter cartridge and a indicator light to signal when the filter needs to be replaced. "
