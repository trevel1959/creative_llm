    "**Self-Cleaning Mechanism**: Introduce a self-cleaning feature that uses steam or ultrasonic waves to clean the juicer after each use. This could save time and effort for users, encouraging more frequent juicing. The self-cleaning cycle could be activated with the push of a button or programmed to run after every juicing session.",
    "**Modular Design with Interchangeable Parts**: Create a juicer with a modular design that allows users to easily swap out parts for different functions. For example, users could switch between a juicing attachment, a smoothie blender, or a nut milk maker. This would maximize the versatility of the appliance, catering to various culinary needs without requiring multiple devices.",
    "**Built-in Nutrient Extractor**: Design a juicer that not only extracts juice but also captures and preserves the nutrients that are typically lost during the juicing process. This could be achieved through a dual-chamber system where one chamber extracts juice while the other uses low temperatures to break down cell walls and release additional nutrients, ensuring that the final product is as healthful as possible.",
    "**Eco-Friendly Materials and Energy Efficiency**: Develop a juicer made from sustainable materials, such as recycled plastics or biodegradable components. Additionally, incorporate energy-efficient motors and components that reduce electricity consumption. A solar-powered version could also be explored for outdoor use, appealing to environmentally conscious consumers.",
    "**Interactive Touchscreen Interface**: Replace traditional buttons with a touchscreen interface that offers an intuitive user experience. Users could select juice types, adjust pulp levels, and customize blending speeds with a simple swipe. The interface could also display nutritional information, prep tips, and even instructional videos on how to use the juicer effectively."
