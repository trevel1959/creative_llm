    "**Look for unique shapes and structures:** Different objects have distinct shapes and structures, which can assist in their identification. For example, a ball will have a round shape, while a cube or a brick will have a rectangular shape.",
    "**Utilize sound patterns:** Different objects generate different sounds when objects are moved, touched, or dropped. For example, a glass will make a ringing sound when dropped, while a metal pipe will produce a different sound.",
    "**Utilize heat difference:** Some objects produce temperature variations, which can be sensed. For example, a hot object will feel warmer than a cold object. This information can be used to differentiate objects in the dark.",
    "**Use smells:** Different objects have unique smells. For example, a flower will have a distinct smell, while a rubber ball will have a rubbery smell.",
    "**Look at physical properties:** Some objects have distinct physical properties, such as weight, density, or size, which can be determined using basic tools or tests. For example, a larger object will have a heavier weight than a smaller object."
