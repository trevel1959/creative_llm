    "**Audio-Enhanced Environments**: Develop an AI-powered system that converts visual information into detailed audio descriptions, helping visually impaired individuals navigate their surroundings more effectively. The system would analyze images using computer vision algorithms, providing context-specific audio feedback. For example, when entering a room, the system could describe the layout, location of objects, and any potential obstacles. This would significantly enhance independence and safety in daily activities.",
    "**Touch-Based Navigation App**: Create an app that utilizes haptic feedback and machine learning to guide users through their environment. The app would learn the user's preferences and movements over time, adjusting the guidance based on their needs. It could include features like predictive navigation (suggesting paths before the user reaches a decision point), customizable tactile cues, and integration with wearable devices for enhanced feedback.",
    "**Intelligent Personalized Audio Books**: Develop an AI-driven service that converts text into spoken word, with added features tailored to the individual user's preferences and needs. The system could adjust speech rate, tone, and style based on the content and the listener's feedback. Additionally, it could incorporate background music or sound effects relevant to the book's setting, creating a rich auditory experience.",
    "**Interactive Braille Display**: Design an advanced Braille display that integrates seamlessly with digital devices. The device would allow users to read digital content in Braille, including emails, messages, and web pages. It could also feature voice-to-braille conversion, enabling real-time translation of spoken words into Braille, facilitating communication with non-visually impaired individuals.",
    "**Augmented Reality for Orientation and Wayfinding**: Implement an AR application that overlays navigational information onto the user's real-world view. This system could provide turn-by-turn directions, highlight important landmarks, and offer context-based information about locations. It would be especially useful in complex environments such as airports, hospitals, or large retail stores. The AR interface would be designed to be intuitive and accessible, with options for customization based on user preferences."
