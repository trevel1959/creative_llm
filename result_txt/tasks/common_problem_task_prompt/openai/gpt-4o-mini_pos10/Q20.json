    "**Cybersecurity Threats**: Self-driving cars rely heavily on software and connectivity, making them vulnerable to hacking. A malicious actor could take control of a vehicle, leading to dangerous situations, privacy breaches, or theft of personal data. Owners would need to be vigilant about updates and security measures to protect their vehicle from cyber threats.",
    "**Technical Malfunctions**: Just like any technology, self-driving cars can experience malfunctions. Whether it's a failure in the sensor systems, software bugs, or issues with navigation, these problems could lead to accidents or getting stranded in unsafe locations. Owners must stay informed about the maintenance needs of their vehicles and be prepared for unexpected breakdowns.",
    "**Ethical Dilemmas**: Self-driving cars may face scenarios that require ethical decision-making, such as choosing between the lesser of two harms in an unavoidable accident. Owners might struggle with the implications of these decisions, especially if they disagree with the programmed responses of their vehicle. This could lead to discomfort and moral concerns about the technology they rely on.",
    "**Regulatory Compliance**: As self-driving cars are still a relatively new technology, regulations are constantly evolving. Owners may find themselves facing challenges in ensuring that their vehicle complies with local laws, which could vary significantly from one region to another. This can create confusion and potential legal issues if they inadvertently violate regulations.",
    "**Impact on Employment**: The widespread adoption of self-driving cars could lead to job displacement in sectors such as transportation and delivery services. Owners may face social and economic ramifications as the demand for traditional drivers declines, affecting their communities and the economy at large. This could lead to concerns about the future job market and the need for retraining."
