    "On an indoor surface: If all other options were unavailable, one could sit on an indoor surface such as a table, desk, or kitchen counter. This would provide a relatively comfortable seating option, especially for short periods or activities that can be done in a standing position.",
    "On a piece of furniture: If there is a piece of furniture available such as a couch, sofa, or chair, one could utilize it as a makeshift seat. This would provide a comfortable seating option, although not as sturdy or portable as some of the other options.",
    "On a crate or milk crate: If there is a crate or milk crate available, one could place it on its side or set it on its footers for a makeshift stool. This would provide a sturdy and portable seating option, suitable for various indoor or outdoor activities."
