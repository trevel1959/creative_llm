    "**Smart Home Integration**: Create a smart home system equipped with AI that can monitor the environment for hazards. This system would use cameras and sensors to detect changes in the home, such as spills, sharp objects on the floor, or open flames. The AI could provide audio alerts or activate automatic safety measures, like shutting off appliances or locking doors, to keep the individual safe even without the ability to feel physical sensations.",
    "**Companion Robot**: Design a robotic companion that serves as a personal safety assistant. This robot would be programmed to detect potential hazards in the environment and respond accordingly. For example, it could physically guide the individual away from dangerous situations, alert them to obstacles, or even assist in daily tasks, ensuring that the person is protected from accidental injuries due to their lack of sensation.",
    "**Visual Feedback System**: Implement a system of visual indicators that provide feedback about the wearerâ€™s physical state. For instance, LED lights could be placed on the body or clothing to indicate temperature extremes, pressure points, or the proximity of objects. By using color-coded signals (e.g., red for danger, blue for cold), the individual could visually assess their surroundings and make informed decisions to avoid injury.",
    "**Environmental Awareness Training**: Develop a comprehensive training program focused on enhancing spatial awareness and cognitive skills. This program would teach individuals how to navigate their environment using auditory cues, visual markers, and mental mapping techniques. By honing these skills, they could better anticipate and avoid potential hazards, compensating for their lack of physical sensation.",
    "**Community Support Network**: Establish a community-based support network where individuals with similar challenges can connect and share experiences. This network could include regular meet-ups, workshops, and safety drills that teach members how to navigate various environments safely. By fostering a sense of community, individuals can rely on each other for assistance and develop strategies to protect themselves from injury."
