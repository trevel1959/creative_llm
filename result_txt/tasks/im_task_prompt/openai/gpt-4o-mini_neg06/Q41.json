    "**Self-Balancing Skateboard**: Develop a skateboard with built-in gyroscopic sensors and motors that help maintain balance. This feature would be particularly beneficial for beginners or those who may have difficulty balancing. The skateboard could adjust its tilt and weight distribution to prevent falls, making it safer and more accessible for a wider range of users.",
    "**Interchangeable Decks with Custom Designs**: Create a skateboard that allows users to easily swap out decks with different designs, materials, and shapes. This would cater to personal style preferences and riding styles (e.g., street vs. vert). Users could purchase or design their own decks, allowing for customization and a unique look while promoting creativity in the skateboarding community.",
    "**Solar-Powered Skateboard**: Integrate solar panels into the skateboardâ€™s design that charge a small battery to power lights, a Bluetooth speaker, or even a small electric motor for assisted riding. This eco-friendly feature would not only promote sustainability but also enhance safety during night rides with built-in LED lights.",
    "**Skateboard with Built-in Suspension System**: Introduce a skateboard with a lightweight suspension system that absorbs shocks from rough terrain. This feature would improve comfort and control, making it easier to ride on uneven surfaces or during tricks. The suspension could be adjustable, allowing riders to set their preferred level of firmness based on their riding style.",
    "**Multi-Functional Skateboard with Storage**: Design a skateboard that incorporates storage compartments within the deck for carrying small items such as tools, snacks, or personal belongings. The compartments could be waterproof and secure, making it convenient for skaters who want to carry essentials without needing a backpack. Additionally, a detachable side bag could be included for extra storage."
