    "**3D Printed House**: 3D printing technology has advanced significantly in recent years, and it's possible that in the future, houses could be built using 3D printers. These printers could use a variety of materials, such as concrete or recycled plastics, to create walls, floors, and other structural components. This method of construction would be faster and more efficient than traditional building methods.",
    "**Earthbag House**: Earthbag houses are built using a technique called earthbag construction, where bags filled with soil or sand are used to create walls. This method is environmentally friendly, as it requires minimal resources and can be done with locally available materials. Earthbag houses are also energy-efficient and can be insulated to keep the interior temperature comfortable.",
    "**Sustainable Timber House**: Although the availability of natural wood may be limited, there are many sustainable alternatives available. For example, reclaimed or salvaged wood can be used to build a house. This not only reduces the demand for new resources but also gives a new life to old materials. Additionally, sustainable forestry practices can be used to ensure that new wood supplies are harvested in a responsible and sustainable manner.",
    "**Bamboo House**: Bamboo is a fast-growing, renewable resource that can be used to build houses. It's a versatile material that can be used for walls, floors, and even furniture. Bamboo houses are also environmentally friendly, as they require minimal processing and can be grown in a variety of climates.",
    "**Modular House**: A modular house is built in sections, which are then transported to the construction site and assembled together. This method of construction allows for a wide range of materials to be used, including metal, concrete, and recycled plastics. Modular houses are also more energy-efficient than traditional houses, as they can be designed with insulation and smart technology in mind."
