    "**Economic Shifts:** If immortality were discovered, the global economy would face significant changes. The workforce would need to be restructured as people could work indefinitely without retirement or age-related limitations. This could lead to new job roles focusing on helping individuals manage the challenges of living for centuries, such as emotional well-being, physical health maintenance, and cognitive stimulation.",
    "**Social Dynamics:** Immortality would drastically alter social structures. Relationships would become more transient as people would not experience the natural progression of life stages. Traditional family structures might dissolve as individuals live beyond their children's lifespans. New forms of community and society would emerge, focusing on longevity clubs or societies where members share knowledge and experiences across generations.",
    "**Cultural Evolution:** Cultures and traditions might evolve dramatically in response to the new reality of living forever. Art, music, and literature could explore themes of timelessness, the meaning of life, and the impact of having infinite time to ponder existence. Religious beliefs and practices may also undergo significant changes, potentially leading to a new spiritual landscape centered around the pursuit of inner peace, wisdom, and personal development.",
    "**Environmental Impact:** With humans living much longer than before, resource consumption and waste generation could skyrocket. This might lead to accelerated environmental degradation if current consumption patterns remain unchanged. Efforts towards sustainability and conservation would become even more critical, possibly leading to the development of advanced technologies for resource recycling and renewable energy sources.",
    "**Ethical Dilemmas:** The discovery of immortality would raise numerous ethical questions. Issues surrounding aging, quality of life, and the potential for societal inequality based on access to immortality (if it were to be a privilege) would come into play. There might be debates about whether or not to allow or encourage human experimentation with this technology, considering the unknown long-term effects on health and mental well-being. Additionally, there could be discussions around the right to die and the implications of living forever on the concept of death and its role in human culture and philosophy."
