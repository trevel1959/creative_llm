The user can control the kettle remotely to heat water to a specific temperature, making it perfect for brewing coffee or tea at the desired temperature. The kettle could also be programmed to turn off automatically once the water reaches the set temperature, ensuring safety and energy efficiency.",
    "**Portable Electric Kettle with Solar Panel Charging:** For those who enjoy outdoor activities, a portable electric kettle with a built-in solar panel charging system would be a game-changer. This device would allow campers, hikers, and outdoor enthusiasts to boil water using renewable energy sources, reducing reliance on traditional power outlets. It would feature a compact design with a removable solar panel that can be carried separately for easy charging.",
    "**Smart Water Filtration System with Electric Kettle:** Combining water filtration technology with an electric kettle creates a convenient solution for purifying tap water before boiling. The system could include a filter cartridge within the kettle body or a separate attachment that filters the water as it heats up. This ensures that users can enjoy clean, filtered water without the need for additional filtration steps.",
    "**Wireless Induction Heating Electric Kettle:** This idea introduces an electric kettle that utilizes wireless induction technology instead of traditional heating elements. The kettle would sit on a charging pad, eliminating the need for cords or an electrical outlet. This design offers improved safety, especially in kitchens where cords can pose tripping hazards. The wireless charging pad could be placed under a countertop or mounted on a wall, providing a sleek and convenient solution.",
    "**Eco-Friendly Electric Kettle with Bamboo Lid and Base:** To promote sustainability, an electric kettle could be designed with a bamboo lid and base. Bamboo is a highly renewable resource, making this kettle environmentally friendly. The bamboo components would provide a natural aesthetic appeal while offering durability and resistance to heat. Additionally, the kettle could incorporate other eco-friendly features, such as a low-energy consumption mode, to reduce its environmental impact further."
