    "**Biometric Tattoos**: Integrate biometric data, such as fingerprints, iris scans, or DNA, into a person's tattoo. This would require a secure and tamper-evident design, making it difficult to forge or alter. The tattoo could be linked to a blockchain or a decentralized database, ensuring the authenticity of the biometric data.",
    "**Neurosignature**: Develop a technology that maps an individual's brain activity, creating a unique signature. This signature could be used to verify identity, much like a fingerprint. The technology would involve non-invasive brain-computer interfaces (BCIs) that record and analyze brain waves.",
    "**Smart Contact Lenses**: Design contact lenses with integrated microchips that contain a person's identification information. These lenses would be nearly impossible to forge and could be used for various applications, such as secure authentication, medical records, or even cryptocurrency transactions.",
    "**Personal DNA Holograms**: Create a 3D holographic representation of an individual's DNA, which would serve as a unique identifier. This hologram could be stored on a secure, decentralized platform and used for authentication purposes. The hologram would be virtually unforgeable and could be used for various applications, such as secure transactions or access control.",
    "**Quantum Key Distribution (QKD) Implants**: Develop implantable devices that use QKD technology to securely authenticate individuals. QKD relies on the principles of quantum mechanics to create an unbreakable encryption key. The implant would be linked to a person's biometric data, creating a secure and unique identifier."
