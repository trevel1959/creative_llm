    "**Scent Layering Candles**: Create a line of candles that feature multiple layers of different scents. Each layer can be designed to melt at different rates, allowing for a unique scent experience as the candle burns. For example, the first layer could be a fresh citrus scent, transitioning into a floral middle layer, and finishing with a warm vanilla base. This would allow users to enjoy a complex fragrance journey throughout the candle's life.",
    "**Candle Subscription Box**: Launch a subscription service where customers receive a new, unique candle each month. Each candle could be themed around a particular season, holiday, or even a famous location, complete with a short story or history about the scent. This not only keeps the excitement alive but also encourages customers to explore various fragrances they might not have chosen themselves.",
    "**Eco-Friendly Refillable Candles**: Design candles with a refillable base that allows users to replace the wax and wick once it has burned down. The outer container could be made from sustainable materials, and users could purchase wax refills in various scents. This not only reduces waste but also encourages creativity, as users can mix and match different scents to create their own unique blends.",
    "**Mood-Enhancing Candles**: Incorporate aromatherapy into candle design by infusing specific essential oils known for their mood-enhancing properties. For example, candles could be made with calming lavender for relaxation, invigorating citrus for energy, or grounding cedarwood for focus. Each candle could come with a guide on the best times to use it and how to pair it with activities like meditation or yoga.",
    "**Interactive Candle Holders**: Create candle holders that respond to the heat of the candle flame. These holders could change color or even emit soft sounds based on the temperature, creating an interactive experience. For instance, as the candle burns and the heat increases, the holder could glow warmer colors, enhancing the ambiance of the space and creating a visual representation of the candle's warmth."
