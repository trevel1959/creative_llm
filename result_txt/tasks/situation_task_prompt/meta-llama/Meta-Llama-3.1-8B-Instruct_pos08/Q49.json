    "**Fire-Resistant Materials**: If all fire-fighting equipment disappeared, I would focus on using fire-resistant materials in my home. I would replace all flammable materials such as curtains, bedding, and carpets with fire-resistant alternatives like ceramic tiles, glass, and metal. This would significantly reduce the risk of my home catching fire.",
    "**Fire Escape Plan**: I would create a fire escape plan with my family, identifying at least two safe exit routes from each room. We would practice the plan regularly to ensure everyone knows what to do in case of a fire. This would ensure we can evacuate the house quickly and safely.",
    "**Fire-Proof Containers**: I would use fire-proof containers to store flammable materials like gasoline, paint, and chemicals. These containers would be made of heat-resistant materials like steel or ceramic and would be kept in a well-ventilated area away from living spaces.",
    "**Early Detection Systems**: I would install early detection systems like smoke detectors and heat sensors throughout my home. These systems would alert me to any potential fire hazards, allowing me to take action before the fire spreads.",
    "**Fire-Fighting Team**: If all fire-fighting equipment disappeared, I would assemble a fire-fighting team with my neighbors and community members. We would work together to develop a plan for fighting fires using homemade equipment like fire extinguishers made from sand, water, and other non-flammable materials. We would also establish a system for quickly responding to fires and providing aid to those in need.
