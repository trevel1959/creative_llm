    "Sky-Car: A flying car that uses a combination of solar panels and wind turbines to propel itself through the air. It has a sleek, aerodynamic design and can seat up to four passengers. Sky-Cars would be equipped with advanced safety features, including automatic landing and collision avoidance systems.",
    "Hyperloop: A high-speed transportation system that uses magnetic levitation technology to propel passengers through a vacuum-sealed tube. Hyperloop systems would be able to reach speeds of up to 700 miles per hour, making them ideal for long-distance travel.",
    "Maglev Train: A high-speed train that uses magnetic levitation technology to propel itself through the air. Maglev trains would be able to reach speeds of up to 300 miles per hour and would be powered by renewable energy sources, such as solar panels and wind turbines.",
    "Aqua-Car: A car that is designed to travel on water. Aqua-Cars would be equipped with propellers and a hull that is watertight, allowing them to travel at high speeds on rivers, lakes, and oceans. They would be ideal for people who live in areas with a lot of water or for those who enjoy water sports.",
    "Vertical Takeoff and Landing (VTOL) Drone: A drone that is designed to take off and land vertically, similar to a helicopter. VTOL drones would be equipped with advanced propulsion systems, allowing them to reach speeds of up to 200 miles per hour. They would be ideal for short-distance transportation and for delivering packages to remote areas."
