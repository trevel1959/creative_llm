    "Funding and resource constraints: Archaeological digs can be time-consuming and expensive, requiring constant monitoring and resources to support the dig team. If funding or resources become scarce, the archaeologists may have to make tough decisions about which areas to investigate further, which could limit the scope of their findings.",
    "Weather and environmental factors: An archaeological dig is heavily impacted by the weather, and extreme conditions could threaten the safety and efficiency of the dig team. Additionally, changes in the local environment due to climate, erosion, or other factors could cause the site to be less preserved over time.",
    "Differences in opinion and collaborative challenges: Working with a team of archaeologists can be challenging, as they may have different ideas and priorities. This could lead to disagreements and arguments over which areas to investigate, how to interpret the data, and how to present the findings.",
    "Unexpected human interference: An archaeological site may be located near a populated area, so there is a risk of human interference in the form of vandalism, theft, or the accidental discovery of buried artifacts by construction or development projects.",
    "Site preservation and maintenance: To protect the integrity of the site, archaeologists must take care to minimize their impact on the environment and the artifacts. This means taking steps to properly document and protect the site, as well as finding ways to prevent further deterioration or damage over time."
