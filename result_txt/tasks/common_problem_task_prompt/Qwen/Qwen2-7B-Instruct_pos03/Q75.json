    "**Innovative Visitor Engagement Program:** Develop an interactive visitor engagement program that utilizes augmented reality (AR) technology. This program would allow visitors to explore the park's history, flora, fauna, and geology through their smartphones or AR glasses. By scanning specific locations or objects within the park, visitors can access detailed information, historical facts, and even virtual tours of areas that might be inaccessible due to safety concerns or conservation needs. This not only enhances the educational value but also offers a unique and engaging experience for visitors.",
    "**Eco-Friendly Transportation System:** Implement a comprehensive eco-friendly transportation system within the national park, such as electric buses, bicycles, and electric boats. This system would reduce carbon emissions, promote sustainable tourism, and encourage visitors to explore the park in a low-impact manner. The park could also collaborate with local communities to offer guided tours on traditional modes of transportation, providing an opportunity for cultural exchange and showcasing the area's rich heritage.",
