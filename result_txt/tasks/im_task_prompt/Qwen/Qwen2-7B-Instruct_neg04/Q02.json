    "**Electrically Assisted Bicycle (EAB)**: This idea involves integrating an electric motor into a bicycle that can assist in pedaling. The motor would kick in when the rider needs more power, such as going uphill or while carrying heavy loads. The battery could be rechargeable and mounted on the frame for convenience. It would also have regenerative braking to help recharge the battery during use. This innovation would cater to people who want exercise but need some assistance, making cycling more accessible and convenient.",
    "**Recycling Bicycle**: This concept is about creating a bicycle made from recycled materials. The frame could be made from reclaimed metal, such as old bike parts, scrap steel, or aluminum cans. Components like seats, handles, and even tires could be sourced from discarded bicycles. This not only reduces waste but also creates a unique and eco-friendly product. Additionally, the bicycle could feature a design that allows for easy disassembly and recycling at the end of its life cycle.",
    "**Smart Bicycle Helmet**: A helmet equipped with advanced safety features like impact sensors, GPS tracking, and LED lights that flash when the bike moves too fast or if the rider is not wearing it properly. It could also include a communication system allowing riders to send distress signals in case of accidents or emergencies. This would enhance safety and provide peace of mind to both cyclists and their loved ones.",
    "**Portable Bicycle Stand**: A foldable stand that easily attaches to the bicycle frame, enabling the user to securely park their bike without leaning against walls or trees. It could be compact enough to carry in a bag or backpack, making it useful for urban commuters who need to navigate crowded streets or tight spaces. This would prevent damage to buildings and public property caused by leaning bikes and would make parking more convenient.",
    "**Bicycle-Powered Air Purifier**: This innovative idea involves creating a bicycle with a built-in air filtration system. As the rider pedals, they would power the air purifier, which could be designed to clean the air around them or extract pollutants from the environment. The air filter could be placed on the front of the bicycle, where it would be most effective at removing particles like dust and pollen. This would be especially beneficial in areas with high pollution levels, promoting cleaner air for cyclists and pedestrians alike."
