    "**Integrate Smart Technology**: Create a smart sandwich toaster that connects to smartphones via an app. The app allows users to remotely start toasting, receive notifications when their sandwich is ready, and even store and recall their favorite sandwich recipes. Additionally, it could offer suggestions based on dietary preferences or ingredients available in the kitchen.",
    "**Expand Cooking Functionality**: Develop a multi-purpose toaster that not only toasts sandwiches but also grills, broils, and even bakes small items like bagels or muffins. This would make it a versatile appliance for breakfast or lunch preparation.",
    "**Sustainable Design**: Create an eco-friendly sandwich toaster made from sustainable materials, such as bamboo or recycled plastics. It could also feature energy-efficient technology to reduce electricity consumption and a built-in recycling bin for sandwich packaging, promoting a greener lifestyle.",
    "**Innovative Toasting Surface**: Introduce a sandwich toaster with a non-stick surface infused with a unique flavor-infusing oil or seasoning. As the sandwich toasts, the flavors slowly permeate the bread, enhancing the overall taste without adding extra calories or fats.",
    "**Portable and Travel-Friendly**: Design a compact, foldable sandwich toaster that is lightweight and easy to carry. This would be perfect for camping trips, dorm rooms, or small kitchens where space is limited. It could also come with a built-in stand for stability and safety during use."
