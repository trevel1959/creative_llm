    "**Innovative Water Purification System:** Develop a portable, high-tech water purification system that can be carried by individuals in disaster zones or survival situations. The system could use advanced filtration techniques like reverse osmosis, UV light sterilization, and activated carbon to remove pollutants and pathogens from contaminated water sources. It could also include a small water collection module to gather rainwater or condensation for purification.",
    "**Water-Collecting Plantation:** Create a specialized plantation of plants known for their ability to purify water through their roots or leaves. For example, the Indian lotus has been shown to filter water by trapping pollutants on its surface. By planting these water-purifying plants around bodies of water, they could naturally cleanse the water as they grow, making it safe for human consumption.",
    "**Nano-Filtering Capsules:** Design tiny capsules containing nano-filters that can be ingested orally. These capsules would pass through the digestive system, extracting contaminants and toxins from the bloodstream. After their job is done, the capsules could either dissolve harmlessly or be excreted without any adverse effects. This could be a quick and convenient solution for individuals needing immediate access to clean water.",
    "**Hybrid Aquaponic Systems:** Implement a combination of aquaponics and hydroponics to create self-sustaining ecosystems that produce both food and clean water. In such systems, fish waste provides nutrients for plants, which in turn purify the water. This approach could provide a sustainable source of clean water while also supporting agricultural production in areas where traditional farming methods are not feasible due to pollution.",
    "**Portable Desalination Units:** Develop small-scale, energy-efficient desalination units that can convert seawater or brackish water into potable water. These units could be powered by renewable energy sources like solar panels or wind turbines, making them highly portable and easily deployable in remote or disaster-stricken areas. They would require minimal maintenance and could significantly increase access to clean drinking water in coastal regions where water sources might be contaminated due to industrial pollution or other environmental factors."
