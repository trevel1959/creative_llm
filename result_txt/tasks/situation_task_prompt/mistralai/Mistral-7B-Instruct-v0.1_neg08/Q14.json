    ": If all music instruments disappeared, I would create music by recording and manipulating the sounds of everyday objects. For example, I could use a potato to create a bass drum or a rubber band to make a snare drum. I could also use my voice to create melodies and harmonies.",
    "Mimicry: If all music instruments disappeared, I would create music by imitating the sounds of animals. For example, I could use my mouth to create the sound of a bird's chirp or my fingers to create the sound of a cat's meow.",
    "Foley: If all music instruments disappeared, I would create music by recording and manipulating the sounds of my surroundings. For example, I could use a spoon to create a percussion sound or a leaf to make a soft chime.",
    "Synthesis: If all music instruments disappeared, I would create music by using electronic instruments and software. For example, I could use a synthesizer to create a wide range of sounds and a drum machine to create beats.",
