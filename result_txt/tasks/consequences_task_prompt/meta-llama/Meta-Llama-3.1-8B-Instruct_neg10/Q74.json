    "**Urban Overcrowding and Resource Depletion**: With the entire world condensed into a single city, the population would skyrocket, leading to severe overcrowding and resource depletion. Housing, food, water, and energy would become scarce, causing social unrest, conflicts, and a significant decrease in quality of life. The city would struggle to accommodate the massive influx of people, resulting in the development of sprawling slums and a lack of basic amenities.",
    "**Loss of Cultural Diversity**: A single city would lead to the homogenization of cultures, as people from different backgrounds would be forced to adapt to a single urban environment. This would result in the loss of unique cultural practices, traditions, and languages, ultimately erasing the rich tapestry of human experience. The city would become a melting pot, but at the cost of cultural diversity.",
    "**Environmental Disaster**: The concentration of human activity in a single city would have devastating environmental consequences. Air and water pollution would become severe, leading to a decline in public health and a decrease in the overall quality of life. The city's infrastructure would struggle to cope with the increased demand for resources, leading to frequent power outages, traffic congestion, and a general decline in living standards.",
    "**Social Isolation and Mental Health Issues**: The loss of personal space and the constant exposure to urban noise and chaos would take a toll on mental health. People would struggle to cope with the stress and anxiety of living in a densely populated city, leading to increased rates of depression, anxiety disorders, and other mental health issues. Social isolation would become a major concern, as people would struggle to form meaningful connections in a crowded and impersonal environment.",
    "**Economic Collapse**: A single city would lead to economic stagnation, as the concentration of industries and resources would create a monopoly that stifles innovation and competition. The lack of diversity in economic activity would result in a narrow range of job opportunities, leading to unemployment and poverty. The city's economy would become vulnerable to external shocks, making it difficult to recover from economic downturns. The concentration of wealth and power would lead to a widening income gap, creating social and economic inequality.
