    "The invention of the printing press: I would change the invention of the printing press to occur earlier in history, around the 14th century. This would have allowed for the rapid dissemination of knowledge and ideas, leading to a much more enlightened and educated society.",
    "The assassination of Archduke Franz Ferdinand: I would change the assassination of Archduke Franz Ferdinand to occur in a different year, perhaps 1914 or 1915. This would have allowed for a more peaceful resolution to the First World War, saving countless lives and reshaping the course of history.",
    "The moon landing: I would change the moon landing to occur in the 1960s, but with a different outcome. Instead of Neil Armstrong and Buzz Aldrin becoming the first humans to walk on the moon, I would change it to be the first woman, a person of color, or a person with a disability to do so.",
    "The fall of the Berlin Wall: I would change the fall of the Berlin Wall to occur in the 1980s, but with a different outcome. Instead of being a peaceful event, I would change it to be a violent and bloody conflict, leading to a much different outcome for Germany and the world.",
    "The assassination of Martin Luther King Jr.: I would change the assassination of Martin Luther King Jr. to occur in a different year, perhaps 1968 or 1969. This would have allowed for a more peaceful resolution to the Civil Rights Movement and a more progressive society."
