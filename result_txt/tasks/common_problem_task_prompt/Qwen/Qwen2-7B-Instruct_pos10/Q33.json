    "**Innovative Water Filtration System:** Design a water filtration system that can purify seawater into drinkable water. This could involve using natural resources found on the island like sand, rocks, and plants. For example, sand can be used as a basic filter to remove large particles, followed by layers of volcanic rock or charcoal for additional purification. Additionally, certain plants have roots that naturally filter water and could be utilized to create a living water filtration system.",
    "**Self-Sustaining Food Production:** Create a sustainable food production system that utilizes hydroponics and aquaponics. Set up a hydroponic garden that grows crops without soil, using nutrient-rich water instead. Meanwhile, an aquaponic fish tank provides the necessary nutrients for the plants while filtering the water for the fish. This system not only ensures a continuous supply of fresh produce but also provides protein from the fish.",
    "**Crafting a Solar-Powered Communication Device:** Build a simple solar-powered communication device to maintain contact with rescue teams. The device should include a solar panel to charge its battery, which can power a radio or a signal beacon. To enhance the device's functionality, incorporate a Morse code encoder/decoder for communication purposes, ensuring you can send and receive messages efficiently.",
    "**Emergency Signal Tower:** Construct a signal tower that can be seen from miles away to attract the attention of passing ships or planes. The tower can be made from natural materials like bamboo, branches, and vines, woven together for stability. Incorporate reflective surfaces like mirrors or aluminum foil to reflect sunlight and create a visible signal during the day, and utilize torches or flares at night to provide visibility in low-light conditions.",
    "**Survival Skills Training Program:** Develop a comprehensive survival skills training program to help fellow survivors learn essential skills for living on the island. This program should cover topics such as finding and purifying water, constructing shelters, starting fires, hunting and fishing, first aid, and navigation. By sharing knowledge and skills, the group can increase their chances of survival and improve their overall resilience."
