    "**Self-Cleaning Mechanism**: Design a washing machine with a built-in self-cleaning feature that uses steam and high-temperature water to sanitize the drum and internal components. This would not only enhance hygiene but also prolong the lifespan of the machine by preventing mold and mildew buildup.",
    "**Fabric Care Sensor Technology**: Implement advanced sensors that can detect the fabric type and level of dirtiness in the laundry load. This technology would automatically adjust the wash cycle settings (temperature, duration, and spin speed) for optimal cleaning while minimizing wear and tear on delicate fabrics.",
    "**Eco-Friendly Detergent Dispenser**: Create a washing machine that has a built-in dispenser for eco-friendly, concentrated detergent pods. This dispenser could be refillable and designed to mix the detergent with water at the right ratio, reducing waste and promoting the use of environmentally safe cleaning products.",
    "**Interactive Touchscreen Interface**: Replace traditional dials and buttons with a user-friendly touchscreen interface that allows for customizable wash programs, easy access to troubleshooting guides, and the ability to download new wash cycles or updates directly from the manufacturer. This could also include tutorials for users on how to optimize their washing experience.",
    "**Multi-Function Laundry Hub**: Transform the washing machine into a multi-functional laundry hub that includes features like a built-in dryer, folding assistant, and even a small ironing mechanism. This would save space in smaller homes and provide a comprehensive laundry solution all in one appliance."
