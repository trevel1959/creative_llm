    "**Aesthetic Disputes**: Homeowners may have differing opinions on the appearance of solar panels. In neighborhoods with strict homeowners' associations or historical preservation guidelines, the installation of solar panels could lead to disputes over visual aesthetics and compliance with local regulations. This could result in a lack of uniformity in the neighborhood and potential legal battles over compliance.",
    "**Grid Integration Challenges**: As more homes install solar panels, the local electrical grid may face challenges in managing the increased influx of energy. If the grid isn't upgraded to handle this new load, it could lead to instability, blackouts, or inefficient energy distribution. Utilities may need to invest in significant infrastructure improvements to accommodate the change.",
    "**Financial Disparities**: While solar panels can save money in the long run, the initial investment can be a barrier for low-income households. If the city doesn't provide adequate financial assistance or incentives, there may be an inequitable distribution of solar technology adoption, leading to a divide between wealthier and poorer neighborhoods in terms of energy independence and savings.",
    "**Maintenance and Repair Issues**: Solar panels require regular maintenance to operate efficiently. Homeowners may not be aware of the necessary upkeep or may not have the skills to perform repairs themselves. This could lead to decreased efficiency over time if panels are not properly maintained, and homeowners may face unexpected costs for professional services.",
    "**Wildlife and Environmental Impact**: Large-scale installation of solar panels could disrupt local ecosystems, particularly if installations require clearing land or if panels are placed in areas frequented by wildlife. The city would need to conduct environmental impact assessments to ensure that the benefits of solar energy do not come at the cost of local biodiversity."
