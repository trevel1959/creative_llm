    "**Water Filtration System Using Natural Materials:** Create a portable filtration system that utilizes natural materials like sand, gravel, charcoal, and biological filters to purify water. This system could be designed for emergency use in remote areas or disaster-stricken regions. The sand and gravel act as mechanical filters to remove large particles, the charcoal absorbs impurities and odors, and the biological filter uses bacteria to break down harmful substances.",
    "**Water Purification Capsule:** Develop a compact, reusable capsule that can be dropped into any body of water. This capsule would contain an advanced filter membrane, activated carbon, and a biocatalyst that breaks down contaminants on contact. The user would simply place the capsule in the water, wait for a few minutes, then retrieve clean water from the bottom of the container. ",
    "**Solar-Powered Water Purification Device:** Design a device that combines solar power with advanced water purification technology. The device would include a solar panel to power UV lights and an advanced filter. The UV light kills bacteria and viruses while the filter removes other contaminants. This device could be used in areas without access to electricity, harnessing the power of the sun to provide clean water.",
    "**Nano-Filtration Water Purifier:** Utilize nanotechnology to create a highly effective water purifier. Nano-filters are extremely small and can remove even the smallest impurities, including bacteria, viruses, and chemicals. This technology can be integrated into home appliances or created as portable devices for on-the-go use.",
    "**Bioremediation Plant:** Establish large-scale bioremediation plants in strategic locations around the globe. These plants would use microorganisms to break down pollutants in water sources. The plants would be designed to treat large volumes of water efficiently and continuously, making them suitable for both rural and urban areas. The treated water would be released back into the environment after being purified. This solution would require significant investment but could potentially provide a sustainable long-term solution to water pollution."
