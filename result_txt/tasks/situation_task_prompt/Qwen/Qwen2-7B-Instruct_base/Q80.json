    "**Blockchain-based Digital Currency**: In this scenario, people could use digital currencies based on blockchain technology to pay for goods and services. Blockchain provides a secure, decentralized platform for transactions without the need for physical currency. Each transaction would be recorded in a public ledger, ensuring transparency and reducing the risk of fraud.",
    "**Smart Contracts**: Implementing smart contracts on a blockchain or another decentralized network could automate payment processes. These contracts automatically execute actions when certain conditions are met, such as delivery confirmation or service completion. This would eliminate the need for physical exchange and reduce transaction time and costs.",
    "**Biometric Authentication**: Using biometric data, like fingerprints, facial recognition, or retinal scans, as a form of identification for payments. People would link their biometric data to their accounts, allowing them to authenticate transactions quickly and securely. This method ensures that only the rightful owner can access their funds, enhancing security.",
    "**Central Bank Digital Currency (CBDC)**: Governments could issue a digital version of their national currency, backed by the central bank. CBDCs would operate within existing banking systems, allowing users to deposit, withdraw, and transfer funds electronically. This solution would maintain the trust in traditional currency while eliminating the need for physical cash.",
    "**Cryptocurrency Wallets and Apps**: Developing advanced wallet apps and platforms that allow users to store, manage, and transact with cryptocurrencies. These applications could integrate with various merchants, enabling seamless payments through digital wallets. To ensure accessibility, these platforms could support multiple cryptocurrencies and provide user-friendly interfaces for managing finances."
