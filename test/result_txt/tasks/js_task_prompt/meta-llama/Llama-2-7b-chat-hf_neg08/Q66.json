    "The first thing I would include in my private island is a luxurious beachside villa with a private pool and outdoor lounge area. The villa would be designed with a modern tropical theme, complete with sliding glass doors that lead out to the pool and stunning ocean views.",
    "Next, I would create a world-class spa and wellness center, complete with a variety of treatment rooms, a sauna, a steam room, and an outdoor hot tub. Guests could indulge in massages, facials, and other pampering treatments, all surrounded by lush vegetation and calming sounds of nature.",
    "To ensure that my private island is a true escape from the stresses of everyday life, I would also create a state-of-the-art meditation and yoga center. This would include a variety of classes and workshops, as well as private instruction for those looking to deepen their practice.",
    "For the more adventurous, I would design an action-packed water sports center, complete with kayaks, paddleboards, and jet skis. Guests could spend their days exploring the surrounding waters and taking part in thrilling activities like wakeboarding and parasailing.",
    "Finally, I would create a sustainable farm and garden, where guests could learn about and participate in organic farming practices. This would include workshops on composting, permaculture, and other sustainable agriculture techniques, as well as a variety of fresh produce and herbs for guests to enjoy."
