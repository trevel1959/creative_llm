    "Bicycles: One creative idea for traveling from one city to another if all cars were to suddenly stop working is to use bicycles. Bicycles are a sustainable and eco-friendly mode of transportation that can cover long distances with ease. With proper training and infrastructure, bicycles could be used for long-distance travel, and cities could set up designated bike lanes and routes to make the journey safer and more convenient. Confidence score: 0.8",
    "Hoverbikes: Another creative idea for traveling between cities is to use hoverbikes. Hoverbikes are personal aircraft that use fans or rotors to generate lift and propulsion, allowing riders to travel over long distances without the need for roads or infrastructure. Hoverbikes could be powered by electricity or fuel, and could be used for both personal and commercial transportation. Confidence score: 0.9",
    "Maglev Trains: Maglev trains use magnetic levitation technology to lift and propel trains without touching the ground, reducing friction and increasing speed. These trains could be used for long-distance travel, and could be powered by electricity or other sustainable energy sources. Maglev trains could also be used for high-speed transportation between cities, reducing travel time and increasing efficiency. Confidence score: 0.9",
    "Solar-Powered Boats: If all cars were to stop working, solar-powered boats could be used to travel between cities along rivers and coastlines. Solar-powered boats are a sustainable and eco-friendly mode of transportation that can travel long distances using only the power of the sun. These boats could be used for both personal and commercial transportation, and could provide a reliable and efficient means of travel. Confidence score: 0.8",
    "Space Tunnels: A more ambitious and futuristic idea for traveling between cities is to use space tunnels. Space tunnels are hypothetical tunnels that could be dug through the Earth's crust or other planets to connect cities and continents. These tunnels could be used for high-speed transportation, reducing travel time and increasing efficiency. Space tunnels could also be used for interplanetary travel, allowing humans to explore and settle other planets. Confidence score"
