    "**Echolocation Wristband**: A wearable device that utilizes sound waves to create a 3D map of the surroundings, allowing the visually impaired to navigate through spaces with ease. The wristband would emit high-frequency sound waves, which would bounce back and provide the user with a real-time auditory feedback of their environment. This technology could be especially useful for individuals who are blind or have low vision, as it would enable them to build a mental map of their surroundings and avoid obstacles.",
    "**Smart Cane with AI-powered Navigation**: A high-tech cane that integrates AI-powered navigation, allowing the visually impaired to receive real-time directions and obstacle detection. The cane would be equipped with sensors, GPS, and machine learning algorithms to detect and avoid obstacles, provide turn-by-turn directions, and even offer haptic feedback to guide the user through complex spaces.",
    "**Eye-tracking Prosthetic Glasses**: A revolutionary prosthetic glasses system that uses eye-tracking technology to provide the visually impaired with a virtual \"view\" of their surroundings. The glasses would use cameras and sensors to detect the user's gaze, and then project a virtual image of the environment onto a screen, allowing the user to \"see\" their surroundings in real-time.",
    "**Tactile Map Printing**: A 3D printing technology that creates tactile maps for the visually impaired, allowing them to explore and understand their surroundings through touch. The printer would use a specialized ink that raises the surface of the map, creating a raised topography that the user can feel and explore. This technology could be especially useful for individuals who are blind or have low vision, as it would enable them to build a mental map of their surroundings and navigate through spaces with confidence.",
    "**Brain-Computer Interface (BCI) for Navigation**: A non-invasive BCI system that uses electroencephalography (EEG) to detect the user's brain activity and translate it into navigation commands. The system would use machine learning algorithms to learn the user's preferences and adapt to their behavior, allowing them to navigate through spaces with ease and accuracy. This technology could be especially useful for individuals with severe visual impairments, as it would enable them to interact with their environment in a more intuitive and natural way. [/INST] "
