    "**Interactive Augmented Reality Door**: Create a door that integrates augmented reality (AR) technology. When someone stands in front of the door, a screen could display information about the home, such as the current weather, upcoming events, or even a personalized greeting. This could be controlled via a smartphone app, allowing users to customize what visitors see. It could also feature virtual doormen that guide guests on how to enter or provide information about the house.",
    "**Eco-Friendly Door with Solar Panels**: Design a door made from sustainable materials that incorporates solar panels. These panels could power integrated smart features, such as LED lights, sensors, or a small security camera. This eco-friendly door would not only be energy-efficient but could also reduce electricity costs for homeowners while promoting sustainability.",
    "**Self-Sanitizing Door**: In response to health concerns, a door could be developed with self-sanitizing properties. This could be achieved by using materials that are treated with antimicrobial coatings or integrating UV-C light technology that activates when the door is closed. This feature would help reduce the spread of germs and bacteria, making it especially useful in public spaces or healthcare facilities.",
    "**Multi-Functional Door with Built-in Storage**: Imagine a door that doubles as a storage unit. It could have compartments or shelves built into its design, allowing homeowners to store items like shoes, umbrellas, or keys directly within the door itself. This would save space in entryways and keep the area organized. The door could also have a customizable front panel that matches the homeâ€™s decor, making it both functional and stylish.",
    "**Soundproof Door with Adjustable Acoustics**: Create a door that features adjustable soundproofing technology. This could include a mechanism that allows homeowners to modify the door's density or insulation properties based on their needs. For instance, when hosting a party, the door could allow more sound to pass through, while during quiet hours, it could be adjusted to block noise effectively. This would be perfect for homes located in noisy environments or for those who value peace and quiet."
