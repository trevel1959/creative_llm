    "Scent-sational Journey: Create a candle that takes users on a sensory adventure with a unique blend of scents. Each layer of the candle would release a different fragrance, transporting the user to a different destination, such as a tropical island, a bustling city, or a peaceful forest.",
    "Mood Lighting: Design a candle that changes color and brightness based on the user's emotions. Using advanced LED technology, the candle would be able to detect changes in the user's mood and adjust its light accordingly. For example, if the user is feeling stressed, the candle would emit a soothing blue light, while a happy mood would be signaled by a warm, yellow glow.",
    "Interactive Art: Create a candle that doubles as an interactive art piece. The candle would feature a unique design, such as a geometric pattern or a portrait, that would be revealed as the wax melts. Users could customize the design by choosing from a variety of colors and patterns, making each candle a one-of-a-kind piece of art.",
    "Time Traveler's Candle: Design a candle that takes users on a journey through time. The candle would feature different fragrances and colors, each representing a different era or historical event. As the candle burns, users would be transported to a different time and place, immersing them in the sights, sounds, and smells of a bygone era.",
    "Personalized Memory Candle: Create a candle that allows users to capture and preserve their memories. Users could write down their memories on a special card provided with the candle, and then burn the card as the candle burns. The memories would be released into the air as the fragrance of the candle, creating a unique and personalized scent that is tied to the user's memories."
