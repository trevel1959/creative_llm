A rigid coaching strategy that fails to adapt to opponents or in-game situations can lead to defeat. To address this, coaches should engage in continuous learning and development, incorporating feedback from players and analyzing game footage to refine their strategies. They should also foster an environment where players feel comfortable sharing their insights and suggestions.",
