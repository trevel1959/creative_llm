    "**Smart Print Queue Management**:    Develop a printer with an integrated AI that manages print jobs intelligently. This system would prioritize documents based on urgency, paper type, and ink usage, and even suggest alternative formats (like digital versions) for non-urgent tasks. It could also send notifications to users when their print jobs are ready or if there are any issues, streamlining the printing process.",
    "**Modular Design for Customization**:    Create a modular printer design that allows users to easily swap out components like the scanner, paper tray, or even the print head. This would cater to different user needs—such as higher resolution for photography or faster speeds for office environments—without needing to purchase an entirely new printer.",
    "**Interactive Touchscreen Interface**:    Upgrade the printer with an interactive touchscreen interface that allows users to easily navigate settings, print from cloud services, and even access a library of templates for flyers, resumes, and more. The touchscreen could include tutorials for new users and a customizable dashboard for quick access to frequently used features.",
    "**Mobile Printing Station**:    Design a portable printer that can be easily transported and connected to mobile devices via Bluetooth or Wi-Fi. This printer would be ideal for on-the-go professionals, allowing them to print documents, photos, or labels from their smartphones or tablets. It could feature a built-in battery for complete mobility.",
    "**Integrated Document Shredder**:    Combine printing with security by incorporating a document shredder into the printer design. Users could print sensitive documents and have the option to immediately shred any unwanted copies, ensuring that sensitive information is disposed of securely. This would be particularly appealing for businesses handling confidential materials."
