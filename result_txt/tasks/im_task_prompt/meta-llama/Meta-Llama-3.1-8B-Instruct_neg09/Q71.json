    "**Sleeping Bag with Integrated Insect Repellent**: Design a sleeping bag with a built-in insect repellent system. The system would utilize a special membrane that releases a subtle amount of citronella or lemongrass oil, which is known for its natural insect-repelling properties. This would be particularly useful for campers and outdoor enthusiasts who often find themselves bothered by mosquitoes and other pests. The sleeping bag could also include a small, rechargeable fan that blows a gentle breeze, further discouraging insects from approaching the user.",
    "**Smart Sleeping Bag with Climate Control**: Develop a sleeping bag with a built-in temperature regulation system. The system would use advanced materials and phase-change technology to maintain a consistent body temperature, regardless of the external environment. This would be especially useful for people who sleep cold or hot, as the sleeping bag could adjust its insulation to keep the user at a comfortable temperature. The sleeping bag could also include a built-in thermometer and a small display screen that shows the current temperature and humidity levels.",
    "**Sleeping Bag with Integrated Lighting System**: Design a sleeping bag with a built-in lighting system that provides a soft, ambient glow. The system could use LED lights or fiber optics to create a warm and cozy atmosphere, making it easier to read, relax, or navigate in the dark. The sleeping bag could also include a small, rechargeable battery that powers the lights, as well as a USB port for charging personal devices.",
    "**Sleeping Bag with Built-in Soundscaping System**: Create a sleeping bag with a built-in soundscaping system that generates soothing sounds to help users fall asleep and stay asleep. The system could use a combination of white noise, nature sounds, and calming music to create a peaceful atmosphere. The sleeping bag could also include a small, rechargeable speaker that amplifies the sounds, as well as a built-in microphone that allows users to record their own sounds or play back their favorite lullabies.",
    "**Sleeping Bag with Integrated Health Monitoring System**: Develop a sleeping bag with a built-in health monitoring system that tracks the user's vital signs, such as heart rate, breathing rate, and sleep quality. The system could use advanced sensors and machine learning algorithms to provide personalized recommendations for improving sleep quality and overall health. The sleeping bag could also include a small, rechargeable battery that powers the sensors, as well as a USB port for uploading data to a smartphone or computer. </s>[INST] "
