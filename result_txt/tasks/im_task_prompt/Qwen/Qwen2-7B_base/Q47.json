    "Increase maneuverability: Improve the mobility of the vacuum cleaner by adding wheels or implementing a design that makes it easier to navigate tight corners and obstacles. This can help make cleaning more efficient and reduce user fatigue.",
    "Incorporate advanced sensors: Integrate advanced sensors into the vacuum cleaner to detect dirtier areas, adjust cleaning intensity, and optimize the cleaning path for more effective cleaning.",
    "Add sound-dampening features: Reduce noise levels emitted by the vacuum cleaner by incorporating sound-dampening materials or implementing noise-cancelling technology. This can enhance the user experience and improve the overall quality of life.",
    "Develop more lightweight models: Create lightweight vacuum cleaners with reduced mass and increased portability. This can make cleaning more comfortable, especially for individuals with limited mobility or those who frequently use the vacuum cleaner.",
    "Expand eco-friendliness: Develop energy-efficient, eco-friendly vacuum cleaners that reduce energy consumption and minimize environmental impact. This can be achieved through the use of regenerative technologies or by optimizing power usage."
