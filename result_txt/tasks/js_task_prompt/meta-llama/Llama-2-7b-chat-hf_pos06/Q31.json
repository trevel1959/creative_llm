    "Cancer - Confidence Score: 0.9",
    "Immunotherapy: I would explore the use of immunotherapy, which harnesses the body's immune system to fight cancer. This approach has shown great promise in treating various types of cancer, including melanoma, lung cancer, and kidney cancer.",
    "Epigenetic therapy: I would investigate epigenetic modifications that can influence the expression of cancer-causing genes. Epigenetic therapies could potentially reverse these modifications and inhibit the growth of cancer cells.",
    "Lifestyle interventions: I would encourage lifestyle changes, such as a healthy diet, regular exercise, and stress management techniques, to reduce the risk of developing cancer.",
    "Cancer stem cell therapy: I would focus on developing therapies that target the stem cells that fuel the growth and progression of cancer. This approach could potentially lead to a cure for cancer by eliminating the stem cells that sustain the disease."
