    "Herbal remedies: One approach to treating the common cold without medication would be to rely on herbal remedies. For instance, using a blend of herbs such as ginger, peppermint, and eucalyptus can help alleviate symptoms like congestion, cough, and sore throat. Ginger has anti-inflammatory properties that can reduce swelling in the nasal passages, while peppermint can help ease congestion and clear the airways. Eucalyptus oil has decongestant properties that can help relieve nasal congestion and sinus pressure.",
    "Saltwater gargle: Another way to treat a common cold without medication is through a saltwater gargle. Gargling with warm salt water several times a day can help reduce swelling in the throat and loosen mucus, making it easier to cough up. This can also help reduce inflammation and fight off bacteria that may be causing the infection.",
    "Steam inhalation: Steam inhalation is another effective way to treat a common cold without medication. Adding eucalyptus oil or menthol to a pot of boiling water can help loosen mucus and ease congestion in the chest and nose. Inhaling the steam can also help reduce inflammation in the nasal passages and sinuses, making it easier to breathe.",
    "Honey and lemon: Honey has antibacterial properties that can help fight off infections that cause the common cold. Mixing honey with lemon juice can help soothe a sore throat and reduce inflammation. Drinking a warm tea made with honey and lemon several times a day can help alleviate symptoms of the common cold.",
    "Aromatherapy: Using essential oils such as peppermint, eucalyptus, and tea tree oil can help alleviate symptoms of the common cold. These oils can be added to a diffuser or inhaled directly from a cloth or tissue. The oils can help reduce inflammation, ease congestion, and fight off infections that cause the common cold."
