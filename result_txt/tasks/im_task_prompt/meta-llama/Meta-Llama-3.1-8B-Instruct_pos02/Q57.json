    "**Glow-in-the-Dark Mouse**: Design a computer mouse with a glow-in-the-dark coating on the buttons and scroll wheel. This would be especially useful for gamers who play in low-light environments or for people who work late at night. The glow-in-the-dark feature would provide a soft, ambient light that wouldn't be too distracting, allowing users to focus on their work or gaming experience. Additionally, the glow-in-the-dark coating could be designed to be customizable, allowing users to choose from different colors or patterns.",
    "**Ergonomic Shape-Shifting Mouse**: Create a computer mouse with an ergonomic design that can adapt to different hand sizes and shapes. The mouse would have a flexible, silicone body that can be molded to fit comfortably in the user's hand. The shape-shifting feature would be achieved through a combination of sensors and actuators that detect the user's hand shape and adjust the mouse's design accordingly. This would provide a more comfortable and personalized user experience, reducing fatigue and discomfort.",
    "**Virtual Reality (VR) Mouse**: Develop a computer mouse that can be used in conjunction with VR headsets. The mouse would have advanced sensors that track the user's hand movements and translate them into VR actions, such as manipulating virtual objects or navigating virtual environments. The VR mouse would also have a haptic feedback system, providing a more immersive and realistic experience for the user.",
    "**Biometric Mouse**: Design a computer mouse that incorporates biometric sensors to track the user's physical and emotional state. The mouse would use heart rate, skin conductance, and other biometric data to adjust the user's computer experience, such as adjusting the screen brightness or volume based on the user's attention level. The biometric mouse would also provide personalized recommendations for improving the user's productivity and well-being.",
    "**Smart Home Automation Mouse**: Create a computer mouse that integrates with smart home automation systems, allowing users to control their home's lighting, temperature, and security systems directly from their computer. The mouse would have a built-in hub that connects to the user's smart home devices, providing a seamless and convenient way to manage their home's systems. The smart home automation mouse would also have advanced features such as automated routines and scene control, making it easy to customize the user's home experience. [/INST] Assistant: These ideas are creative and original, and they have the potential to make a significant impact in the field of computer mice. Here's a summary of each idea: 1.  **"
