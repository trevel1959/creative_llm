    "Create a sanctuary for birds in the city, where they can learn how to fly again. The sanctuary could be a large aviary with a variety of bird species, and a team of trained bird experts to help them relearn their flying skills. Confidence Score: 0.8",
    "Develop a virtual reality simulation that allows birds to practice flying in a safe and controlled environment. The simulation could mimic real-life scenarios, such as navigating through trees or flying over mountains, and provide feedback on the bird's performance. Confidence Score: 0.9",
    "Create a specialized training program that focuses on the cognitive and motor skills needed for flying. The program could include puzzles, games, and exercises that challenge the bird's memory, problem-solving abilities, and muscle memory. Confidence Score: 0.8",
    "Design a wearable device that uses electrical stimulation to help birds rebuild their flight muscles. The device could be worn on the bird's body and provide targeted stimulation to the muscles needed for flying, gradually increasing the intensity of the stimulation as the bird becomes stronger. Confidence Score: 0.7",
    "Create a social network for birds, where they can connect with other birds and share their experiences and knowledge. The network could include forums, chat rooms, and video conferencing, and provide a platform for birds to collaborate and learn from each other. Confidence Score: 0.6"
