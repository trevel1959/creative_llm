    "**The Retrospective Rover**: Design a vehicle with a retractable, extendable, and pivoting wheel system that allows for smooth movement in reverse. The vehicle would have a large, flat surface area for stability and a unique steering system that utilizes gyroscopes and sensors to navigate through tight spaces.",
    "**The Reverse Walker**: Develop a wearable device that enables individuals to move backwards with ease. This could involve a series of interconnected, articulated legs that mimic the motion of a crab, allowing users to scuttle backwards while maintaining balance and stability.",
    "**The Time-Traveling Treadmill**: Create a large, enclosed treadmill that uses advanced technology to simulate movement in reverse. This could involve a combination of AI-powered navigation, 3D mapping, and haptic feedback to create an immersive experience.",
    "**The Reverse Drone**: Design a drone that can move backwards through the air using a combination of propellers and aerodynamic design. This could involve a unique wing configuration and a sophisticated navigation system that allows the drone to avoid obstacles and maintain stability.",
    "**The Inverted Skateboard**: Develop a skateboard that allows users to move backwards by utilizing a combination of magnets, springs, and advanced materials. This could involve a unique wheel design that enables the board to glide smoothly in reverse while maintaining balance and control. [/INST] "
