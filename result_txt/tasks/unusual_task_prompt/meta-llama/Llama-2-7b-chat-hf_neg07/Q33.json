    "Sponge-inspired Water Filtration System: Create a water filtration system that utilizes the natural properties of sponges to remove impurities from water. The system would consist of a sponge-like filter that traps contaminants and bacteria, allowing clean water to pass through. This innovative system could be used in various settings, such as community water sources, hospitals, and disaster relief efforts.",
    "Sponge-based Skincare Products: Develop a line of skincare products that incorporate the natural exfoliating properties of sponges. These products could include face washes, body scrubs, and masks, all designed to gently remove dead skin cells and improve skin texture and tone. The sponge-based products would be gentle enough for sensitive skin and could be marketed as a more natural alternative to traditional skincare products.",
    "Sponge-inspired Building Materials: Create building materials that mimic the structure and properties of sponges. These materials could be used in construction to improve insulation, reduce noise pollution, and provide a sustainable alternative to traditional building materials. The sponge-like materials could be made from a variety of materials, including recycled materials, and could be used in walls, ceilings, and floors.",
    "Sponge-powered Solar Cells: Develop solar cells that incorporate the natural porous structure of sponges to increase their efficiency. The sponge-like structure would allow for better light absorption and energy conversion, making the solar cells more effective at converting sunlight into electricity. This innovation could lead to more efficient and cost-effective solar panels, making renewable energy more accessible to people around the world.",
    "Sponge-based Art: Create a form of art that utilizes sponges as the primary medium. Artists could use sponges to create unique textures and patterns, blending different colors and materials to create visually striking pieces. The sponge-based art could be used in a variety of settings, from galleries and museums to public spaces and private homes. It could also be used as a therapeutic tool for people with sensory processing disorders, as the tactile nature of the sponge can be calming and soothing"
