    "Daytime Slumber Pods: In a world without nighttime, people could utilize specialized daytime slumber pods to catch some Z's. These pods would be designed to mimic the sensory experiences of nighttime sleep, providing a restful and rejuvenating experience during the day. The pods could be equipped with advanced soundproofing technology, calming scents, and even simulate the feeling of a cool breeze on the skin to help users drift off.",
    "Solar-Powered Sleep Masks: To overcome the lack of nighttime, individuals could use specialized sleep masks that harness the power of the sun to induce sleep. These masks would be designed with advanced solar panels that absorb sunlight during the day, storing it in a built-in battery. At night, the stored energy could be used to power a gentle, soothing light that simulates the darkness of nighttime, allowing for a peaceful slumber.",
    "Circadian Rhythm Regulation: To address the absence of nighttime, people could focus on regulating their internal circadian rhythms. This could involve exposure to bright light therapy during the day, which would help to suppress the production of melatonin and promote wakefulness. In the evening, individuals could use specialized light-emitting devices that emit a specific wavelength of light to stimulate the production of melatonin and induce a relaxing, sleep-promoting state.",
    "Dreamwalking: In a world without nighttime, people could explore new ways to induce vivid dreams and lucid dreaming experiences. One approach could be through the use of specialized headgear that utilizes brain-sensing technology to monitor and manipulate brain activity during sleep. By stimulating specific areas of the brain, individuals could induce vivid dreams and gain greater control over their dreamscapes.",
    "Nocturnal Socialization: In the absence of nighttime, people could find new ways to socialize and connect with others. One approach could be through the use of virtual reality technology, which would allow individuals to interact with others in a simulated nighttime environment. This could include virtual bars, clubs, and other social spaces where people could gather, share experiences, and connect with others in a way that feels familiar and comforting."
