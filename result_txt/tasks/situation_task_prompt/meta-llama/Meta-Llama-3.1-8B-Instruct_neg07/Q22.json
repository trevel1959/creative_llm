    "**Elevated Skyways**: Imagine a network of elevated walkways and bike paths that crisscross the city, allowing people to move around without the need for roads. These skyways could be supported by slender pillars or even repurposed streetlights, minimizing visual impact. The elevated paths would also provide a unique perspective on the city, with stunning views of the surrounding landscape. As an added bonus, the skyways could be designed with integrated solar panels, generating electricity for the city.",
    "**Autonomous Underwater Transportation**: In the event of a global road collapse, cities could be connected by a network of underwater tunnels and tubes. These tubes would be propelled by advanced autonomous vehicles, capable of transporting people and goods at high speeds. The underwater transportation system would not only provide a reliable means of transportation but also offer a unique and futuristic travel experience.",
    "**Vertical Farming and Transportation**: In a world without roads, cities could be transformed into massive vertical farms, with towering structures that grow food and provide transportation. These structures would be designed with integrated transportation systems, such as vacuum tubes or maglev trains, allowing people to move between levels quickly and efficiently. The vertical farms would also provide a sustainable source of fresh produce, reducing the city's reliance on external food sources.",
    "**Personal Aerial Vehicles**: With the disappearance of roads, cities could be filled with personal aerial vehicles (PAVs) that use advanced navigation systems and AI to transport individuals quickly and safely. These PAVs could be designed to be compact, environmentally friendly, and affordable, making them accessible to everyone. The PAVs would also provide a unique perspective on the city, allowing users to soar above the streets and take in the sights.",
    "**Magnetic Levitation Tubes**: In the event of a global road collapse, cities could be connected by a network of magnetic levitation tubes that transport people and goods at high speeds. These tubes would be evacuated and pressurized, allowing for smooth and efficient travel. The magnetic levitation technology would also enable the transportation of heavy goods, such as cargo and construction materials, making it an ideal solution for rebuilding and restoring infrastructure."
