    "Gravity Disruption: With two moons, the gravitational pull on Earth would be unpredictable and chaotic, causing widespread destruction and instability. Confidence Score: 0.8",
    "Tidal Chaos: The increased tidal forces from two moons would cause flooding, coastal erosion, and extreme weather patterns. This would lead to devastating consequences for coastal communities and ecosystems. Confidence Score: 0.9",
    "Unbalanced Ecosystem: The additional gravitational pull of the second moon would throw off the delicate balance of Earth's ecosystems, leading to unprecedented climate changes, loss of biodiversity, and potential extinction events. Confidence Score: 0.95",
    "Unstable Orbits: The gravitational interactions between the two moons would cause their orbits to destabilize, leading to unpredictable and potentially catastrophic collisions. Confidence Score: 0.85",
    "Time Dilation: The gravitational pull of the second moon would cause time to slow down near the moon's surface, potentially leading to bizarre phenomena such as time dilation, gravity waves, and gravitational lensing. Confidence Score: 0.75"
