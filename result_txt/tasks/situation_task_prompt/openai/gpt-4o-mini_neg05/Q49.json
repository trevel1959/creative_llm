    "**Home Design Modifications**: Reinforce your home’s exterior with fire-resistant materials such as stucco, brick, or metal siding. Install tempered glass windows that can withstand high temperatures. Create overhangs and awnings using non-combustible materials to shield your home from radiant heat. Consider a metal roof, which is less likely to catch fire compared to traditional shingles.",
    "**Water-Based Defense System**: Create a DIY water sprinkler system that can be activated during a fire threat. Install rain barrels or large water tanks connected to hoses that can spray water on your roof and surrounding vegetation. This system can be automated with timers or activated remotely, allowing you to create a moisture barrier that can help prevent the spread of fire.",
    "**Fire-Resistant Barriers**: Build a barrier around your home using fire-resistant fencing or walls made of concrete or stone. This can help deflect flames and heat away from your house. Consider creating a moat-like feature filled with gravel or sand that can absorb heat and reduce the likelihood of fire spreading to your home.",
    "**Fire-Detection and Alarm System**: Without traditional firefighting equipment, it’s essential to have a reliable fire detection system. Install smoke detectors and heat sensors throughout your home that can alert you to the presence of fire. Pair this with a smart home system that sends notifications to your phone, allowing you to take action quickly, whether that’s evacuating or using alternative methods to control the fire.",
    "**Community Fire Watch Program**: Organize or join a local community fire watch group. Neighbors can take turns monitoring for fire risks, especially during dry seasons. This collaborative approach allows for quick reporting and response to any signs of fire, as well as sharing resources and knowledge on fire prevention techniques, creating a support network for emergency situations."
