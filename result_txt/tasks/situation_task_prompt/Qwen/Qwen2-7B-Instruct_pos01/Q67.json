    "**Solar Wind Influence:** Without clouds to block it, the intensity of solar radiation reaching Earth's surface could change significantly. This might lead to higher daytime temperatures and cooler nighttime temperatures compared to usual. Additionally, it could alter wind patterns due to changes in atmospheric pressure distribution, potentially causing stronger or weaker winds. Confidence Score: 0.8",
    "**Increased UV Exposure:** Without clouds to filter out ultraviolet (UV) rays, the amount of UV radiation reaching the Earth's surface would increase. This could have significant impacts on human health, increasing the risk of skin cancer and other UV-related diseases. It might also affect the growth of plants, as some species are sensitive to high levels of UV radiation. Confidence Score: 0.7",
    "**Enhanced Heat Retention at Night:** In the absence of clouds, there would be less insulation between the Earth's surface and outer space, potentially leading to a more direct heat loss at night. However, this could also result in more efficient heat retention during the day, depending on local conditions. This dynamic could lead to more extreme temperature fluctuations over time, affecting ecosystems and human comfort. Confidence Score: 0.6",
    "**Changes in Precipitation Patterns:** Clouds play a crucial role in the water cycle by distributing water vapor and influencing precipitation patterns. Without them, the Earth might experience more localized and intense rainfall events, leading to droughts in areas that usually receive moisture from clouds. This could disrupt agricultural cycles and cause water scarcity issues. Confidence Score: 0.9",
    "**Altered Atmospheric Composition:** Clouds are known to influence atmospheric composition through processes like aerosol formation and the removal of pollutants. Without clouds, the balance of gases such as carbon dioxide, methane, and oxygen could be affected, impacting climate regulation and possibly accelerating global warming trends. Confidence Score: 0.8"
