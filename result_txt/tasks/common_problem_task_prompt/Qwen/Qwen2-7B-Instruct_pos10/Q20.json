    "**Enhanced Personalization**: Create a customizable self-driving car that adapts to each user's preferences. This includes options for interior design, seat comfort, entertainment systems, and driving style (sporty, eco-friendly, or leisurely). Users can select their favorite colors, materials, and even choose between different driving experiences based on their mood or destination.",
    "**Innovative Safety Features**: Develop a self-driving car equipped with advanced safety technologies like real-time pedestrian detection, predictive crash avoidance, and emergency braking systems powered by AI. The vehicle could also include a smart warning system that predicts potential road hazards based on traffic patterns and weather conditions, enhancing overall safety on the roads.",
    "**Integration with Public Transportation**: Collaborate with local transit authorities to create a seamless integration between self-driving cars and public transportation systems. For example, passengers could book a ride from their home to a nearby bus or train station, where they would then transfer to public transport, minimizing the need for parking and reducing traffic congestion.",
    "**Dynamic Route Optimization**: Implement an AI-driven route optimization system that considers various factors such as traffic, weather conditions, time of day, and personal preferences. The system could predict delays, suggest alternate routes, and adjust travel times accordingly, ensuring a more efficient journey for passengers. Additionally, this feature could help reduce carbon emissions by suggesting the most energy-efficient routes.",
    "**Comprehensive Maintenance System**: Develop a self-driving car with a built-in maintenance system that monitors the vehicle's health and automatically schedules necessary repairs or replacements. This could include predictive maintenance for components like batteries, brakes, and tires, reducing the likelihood of breakdowns and ensuring the vehicle is always in optimal condition. The system could also offer personalized service recommendations, like when to replace specific parts or upgrade to new technology, based on usage patterns and vehicle performance data."
