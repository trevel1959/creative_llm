    "**Expandable Modular Design**: Create a picnic basket with a modular design that allows users to expand its size based on their needs. The basket could feature collapsible compartments that can be added or removed, making it versatile for small outings or large gatherings. Each module could serve different purposes, such as a cooler, a food compartment, or a storage space for utensils.",
    "**Integrated Solar Charger**: Equip the picnic basket with a solar panel on the lid that can charge devices while you're enjoying the outdoors. This feature would allow users to keep their phones, speakers, or other gadgets charged, making it perfect for longer outings where access to electricity is limited.",
    "**Multi-Function Utensil Set**: Design an integrated utensil set that can be stored within the basket. This set could include foldable or collapsible utensils, a cutting board, and even a small grill or hot plate that can be assembled on-site. This feature would encourage outdoor cooking and make it easier to prepare meals without needing additional gear.",
    "**Smart Inventory Management**: Develop an app that pairs with the picnic basket to help users manage their picnic inventory. The app could allow users to scan items as they pack, suggest recipes based on what they have, and remind them of essentials they might forget, like napkins or sunscreen. It could also keep track of what items need replenishing for future outings.",
    "**Built-In Blanket Compartment**: Incorporate a hidden compartment within the basket that houses a high-quality picnic blanket. This blanket could be water-resistant on one side and soft on the other, and it could easily be pulled out and rolled up for storage. This feature would ensure that users always have a clean and comfortable place to sit, without needing to remember to pack a separate blanket."
