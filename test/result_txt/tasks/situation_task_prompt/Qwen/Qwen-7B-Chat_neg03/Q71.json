    "Utilize containers: Containers are another great way to grow plants in hard soil. You can use anything from small pots to large outdoor storage containers. Just be sure to choose containers that are appropriately sized for your plants and have good drainage.",
    "Grow plants in containers that mimic natural conditions: Consider growing plants in containers that mimic their natural conditions.

    "Experiment with hydroponics: Hydroponics is a method of growing plants without soil. Instead, plants are grown in water that is rich in nutrients. This can be an excellent option for growing plants in hard soil because it allows you to control the soil conditions and provide the right amount of nutrients to each plant."
