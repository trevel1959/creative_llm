    "**Sustainable Coffee Capsule System**: Develop a coffee maker that utilizes biodegradable coffee capsules. Instead of traditional plastic or aluminum capsules, these would be made from plant-based materials that decompose after use. The machine could have a built-in composter for used capsules, turning them into nutrient-rich soil, thereby promoting an eco-friendly cycle.",
    "**Temperature Control Technology**: Introduce a dual-zone temperature control feature that allows users to brew different types of coffee (like espresso and French press) at their optimal temperatures. The coffee maker could have an intuitive interface where users can select the type of coffee they want, and the machine would automatically adjust the brewing temperature accordingly.",
    "**Interactive Coffee Journal**: Equip the coffee maker with a digital display that functions as an interactive coffee journal. Users can log their favorite brews, the origin of the beans, and personal notes about flavor profiles. This feature could also include a community aspect, allowing users to share their coffee experiences and recipes with others through an app connected to the coffee maker.",
    "**Integrated Coffee Grinder**: Design a coffee maker with a built-in grinder that allows users to choose their grind size right before brewing. This feature would ensure maximum freshness and flavor extraction. Users could have options for different grind sizes (coarse, medium, fine) and even adjust the grind time for their preferred strength.",
    "**Multi-Function Brewing**: Create a coffee maker that can also brew tea, hot chocolate, and other beverages. By using interchangeable brewing baskets, users could easily switch between coffee and other drinks. The machine could have preset functions for different beverages, ensuring optimal brewing conditions for each type."
