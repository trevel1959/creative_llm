    "**Airborne Transportation Network**: Develop a network of autonomous, high-speed airships that travel along predetermined routes, connecting major cities. These airships would be equipped with comfortable seating, amenities, and advanced navigation systems, ensuring a safe and enjoyable journey.",
    "**Hyperloop Expansion**: Utilize the existing Hyperloop infrastructure to connect cities, allowing passengers to travel at speeds of up to 700 mph (1,127 km/h) in vacuum-sealed tubes. This would reduce travel time significantly and provide a sustainable, high-speed transportation option.",
    "**Water-Based Transportation Hubs**: Establish a network of water-based transportation hubs, utilizing existing rivers, lakes, and coastal routes to connect cities. This would involve developing advanced watercraft, such as high-speed ferries or hydrofoils, and investing in waterway infrastructure to ensure efficient and safe travel.",
    "**Advanced Bicycle Infrastructure**: Create a comprehensive network of bike lanes, bike highways, and bike-friendly roads that connect cities. This would encourage eco-friendly transportation, reduce traffic congestion, and promote physical activity. Advanced technologies, such as electric-assist bicycles and intelligent bike lanes, would enhance the riding experience.",
    "**Maglev Rail Revival**: Revitalize the Maglev rail network, which uses magnetic levitation to propel trains at high speeds. This would involve upgrading existing Maglev lines, building new ones, and integrating them into a seamless, high-speed transportation system that connects cities across the globe.
