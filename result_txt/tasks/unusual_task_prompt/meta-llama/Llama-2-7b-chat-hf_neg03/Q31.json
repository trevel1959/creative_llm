    "Smart Calculator with AI-Powered Learning: Create a calculator that can learn and adapt to the user's calculation habits and preferences. The calculator can use machine learning algorithms to analyze the user's input and adjust its display and functionality accordingly. For example, if the user consistently uses a particular button or function, the calculator can prioritize that option and make it more accessible. This feature can help users save time and improve their calculation accuracy.",
    "3D Printable Calculator: Design a calculator that can be easily 3D printed by users. The calculator can be made up of interlocking pieces that can be printed on a 3D printer, allowing users to customize the design and style of their calculator. This feature can appeal to users who want a unique and personalized calculator.",
    "Augmented Reality Calculator: Develop a calculator that utilizes augmented reality (AR) technology to display calculations. The calculator can use AR to display calculations in 3D, allowing users to visualize the calculations in real-time. This feature can help users better understand complex calculations and improve their math skills.",
    "Wearable Calculator: Create a calculator that can be worn on the wrist like a smartwatch. The calculator can have a small display screen and a few buttons, allowing users to perform basic calculations without having to carry a separate calculator. This feature can be particularly useful for students, athletes, or anyone who needs to perform quick calculations during an activity.",
    "Brain-Controlled Calculator: Develop a calculator that can be controlled by the user's brain waves. The calculator can use electroencephalography (EEG) sensors to detect the user's brain activity and translate it into calculational commands. This feature can be particularly useful for individuals with mobility or speech impairments, as they can perform calculations without having to physically touch the calculator."
