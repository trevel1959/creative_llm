    "Ask a local for directions: If all maps and navigation systems disappeared, the best way to find your way would be to ask a local for directions. This would require you to interact with people and learn about the local area, which could be a great opportunity to learn new things and meet new people.",
    "Use natural landmarks: Many places have natural landmarks that can be used to navigate, such as mountains, rivers, and coastlines. You could use these landmarks to guide you in the right direction.",
    "Use a compass: A compass is a simple tool that can help you navigate by finding north. You could use a compass to guide you in the right direction, especially if you know which direction you need to go.",
    "Use a smartphone: Even if maps and navigation systems disappeared, your smartphone can still be a valuable tool for finding your way. You could use apps like Google Maps or Waze to get directions, or use GPS to track your location.",
    "Use a GPS tracker: If you have a GPS tracker on your phone or a separate device, you could use it to track your location and get directions. This would require you to have a device that can receive GPS signals, but it could be a useful tool if you're lost."
