    "Create a Community-Led Healthcare System: With the absence of doctors and medical facilities, a community-led healthcare system could be established. This system would prioritize preventive care and focus on promoting overall wellness through community-based initiatives. Neighborhood health committees could be formed to identify health concerns, provide basic first aid, and connect individuals with local herbalists, acupuncturists, and other alternative healers.",
    "Bartering and Trading for Healthcare Services: In the absence of formal medical facilities, a bartering and trading system could emerge. People could exchange goods and services based on their skills and resources, with healthcare services being traded for food, shelter, or other essential needs. This system could foster a sense of community and cooperation, while ensuring that essential healthcare needs are met.",
    "DIY Healthcare Kits: Create DIY healthcare kits that contain basic medical supplies, such as bandages, antiseptic wipes, pain relievers, and other essential medications. These kits could be distributed to individuals and communities, allowing them to provide basic first aid and manage minor health issues on their own. This approach would reduce the reliance on medical professionals and promote self-sufficiency.",
    "Mobile Health Clinics: Establish mobile health clinics that travel to different communities, providing basic medical services and consultations. These clinics could be staffed by volunteer medical professionals, including retired doctors, nurses, and other healthcare workers. This approach would ensure that essential healthcare services reach a wider audience, particularly in remote or underserved areas.",
    "Telemedicine Platforms: Develop telemedicine platforms that connect individuals with medical professionals remotely. These platforms could use video conferencing, messaging, or other digital technologies to facilitate consultations and remote monitoring. This approach would enable individuals to receive medical advice and treatment without the need for in-person visits, reducing the risk of infection and improving access to healthcare services."
