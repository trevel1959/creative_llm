    "**Tactile Feedback Smart Glasses**: Design smart glasses that can be used by visually impaired individuals. The glasses would have built-in sensors to detect obstacles in the user's path. When an obstacle is detected, the glasses would vibrate or emit sounds at different frequencies to guide the user around it. This would help them navigate their environment more efficiently.",
    "**Braille Haptic Text Reader**: Create a wearable device that converts text into Braille for the visually impaired. The device would have a small screen displaying the text, and a haptic feedback mechanism that would physically create Braille patterns as the text scrolls. Users could read along as the text is converted, providing an interactive reading experience.",
    "**Interactive Soundscapes**: Develop an app that transforms audio recordings into spatial soundscapes. This would allow visually impaired individuals to \"see\" through sound. For example, recording the sounds of a forest, the app could use spatial audio techniques to simulate the experience of being there, indicating the location of sounds like birds, leaves rustling, or distant water bodies.",
    "**AI-Assisted Embroidery Machine**: Create an advanced embroidery machine that incorporates AI to assist the visually impaired in creating tactile images. The machine would take inputs from the user via voice commands or a simple interface and convert these into intricate patterns. The AI would optimize the design process, making it easier for the visually impaired to create complex and aesthetically pleasing tactile images.",
    "**Sensory Walkways**: Design a series of walkways that use various textures, smells, and vibrations to guide and educate visually impaired individuals. Each section of the walkway could represent a different environment (e.g., forest, beach, cityscape) with corresponding sensory elements. This would not only aid navigation but also provide an immersive learning experience about different environments and their characteristics."
