    "**Multi-Functional Spatula with Interchangeable Heads**: Design a spatula with a detachable head system that allows users to swap out heads for different cooking tasks. For example, a flat head for flipping, a slotted head for draining, and a rounded head for scraping. This would reduce the need for multiple utensils and make cooking more efficient.",
    "**Self-Cleaning Spatula**: Create a spatula made from a special non-stick material that has a built-in self-cleaning mechanism. When the spatula is placed in water, it would activate a heating element that creates steam, effectively cleaning off food residues without the need for scrubbing.",
    "**Spatula with Built-In Timer and Recipe Guide**: Equip the spatula with a small digital display that includes a timer and a selection of recipes. Users could select a recipe, and the spatula would provide step-by-step instructions and timing cues, making it easier for novice cooks to follow along and achieve great results.",
    "**Ergonomic Design with Grip Enhancements**: Redesign the spatula with a focus on ergonomics. Incorporate a soft, textured grip that conforms to the userâ€™s hand and reduces strain during prolonged use. Additionally, a slight curve in the handle could improve leverage for flipping heavier foods.",
    "**LED Lighted Spatula**: Integrate LED lights into the spatula head to illuminate the cooking surface. This would be particularly useful for cooking in dimly lit environments or for nighttime barbecues. The lights could be adjustable in brightness and color to enhance the cooking experience."
