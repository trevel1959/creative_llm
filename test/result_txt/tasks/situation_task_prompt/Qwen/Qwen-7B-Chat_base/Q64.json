    "Create a time capsule: Write down important details about past events and people in a journal or notebook, then bury it in a safe place with a marker indicating its location. When you want to remember something from the past, dig up the time capsule and read through your notes.",
    "Use storytelling: Share stories with family and friends about past events and people. This can include anecdotes, jokes, and personal experiences that help bring the memories to life.",
    "Make visual aids: Draw or paint pictures of past events and people, using memory prompts such as clothing, locations, or emotions to jog your memory. Hang these pictures in your home or keep them in a photo album for easy access.",
    "Record audio messages: Record voice memos on your phone or other device, describing past events and people in detail. Listen to these recordings whenever you need a reminder of what happened.",
    "Practice mindfulness: Take time each day to reflect on past events and people, focusing on the feelings and sensations associated with those memories. This can help you stay connected to your past and bring those experiences back to mind when needed."
