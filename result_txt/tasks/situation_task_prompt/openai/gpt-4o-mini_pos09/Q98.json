    "**Scented Potpourri Art**: Design decorative potpourri art pieces that incorporate dried flowers, spices, and essential oils. Each piece can be crafted into a visually appealing arrangement that doubles as a home fragrance. For example, a “Winter Wonderland” potpourri could include dried orange slices, cinnamon sticks, and pine needles, offering a seasonal scent that also serves as a beautiful decoration. Users can refresh the scent by adding a few drops of essential oil as needed.",
    "**DIY Scented Sachets**: Develop a kit for creating personalized scented sachets. This kit would include various dried flowers, herbs, and spices, along with small fabric bags. Users can mix and match ingredients to create their own unique blends, like a “Sweet Dreams” sachet with lavender and chamomile for their pillows, or a “Citrus Burst” with dried lemon peel and mint for their drawers. The sachets can be used in closets, cars, or under pillows to provide a subtle, pleasant aroma.",
    "**Aromatic Room Sprays with Food Waste**: Innovate a line of room sprays made from food waste by utilizing citrus peels, coffee grounds, and other aromatic scraps. By infusing these natural ingredients in water and essential oils, you can create eco-friendly sprays that not only smell delightful but also reduce waste. For instance, a “Coffee & Citrus” spray could provide an energizing scent while repurposing used coffee grounds and orange peels, promoting sustainability.",
    "**Nature-Inspired Scent Diffusers**: Design a line of natural diffusers made from biodegradable materials, such as bamboo or clay, that can be infused with essential oils. Users can choose from various natural scents, such as “Forest Fresh” with pine and cedarwood or “Ocean Breeze” with sea salt and eucalyptus. The diffusers could be shaped like natural elements, like stones or leaves, and provide a subtle, long-lasting fragrance as they slowly release the essential oils.",
    "**Scented Edible Decorations**: Create a line of edible decorations that not only look beautiful but also provide pleasant scents. Think of sugar cookies shaped like flowers or stars that are infused with natural flavors like vanilla, lemon, or almond. These cookies can be used to adorn tables during special occasions, and their delightful aroma will enhance the atmosphere while also being a tasty treat for guests."
