    "**Adjustable Lens Technology**: Develop glasses with adjustable lenses that can change their prescription based on the user's needs at different times of the day. This could be achieved through a simple app on a smartphone that communicates with the glasses. For instance, the lenses could automatically adjust for reading, computer work, or driving, providing optimal vision without the need for multiple pairs of glasses.",
    "**Built-in Health Monitoring**: Incorporate sensors into the glasses that monitor various health metrics, such as eye strain, UV exposure, and even blood sugar levels for diabetics. These glasses could alert users when they need to take a break from screens, when they are exposed to harmful UV rays, or when their blood sugar levels are fluctuating, thus promoting better overall health.",
    "**Eco-Friendly Materials**: Design glasses made from sustainable materials, such as biodegradable plastics or recycled metals. This initiative would not only reduce environmental impact but also appeal to eco-conscious consumers. Additionally, offering a recycling program for old glasses could encourage responsible disposal and further reduce waste.",
    "**Customizable Frames with 3D Printing**: Allow users to customize their glasses frames using 3D printing technology. Customers could choose colors, shapes, and designs, or even upload their own designs. This would not only make glasses more personal and unique but also cater to a wider range of fashion tastes and preferences.",
    "**Integrated Bluetooth Audio**: Create glasses that feature built-in Bluetooth speakers, allowing users to listen to music or take phone calls without the need for earbuds. The design could ensure that the audio is directed towards the wearerâ€™s ears while minimizing sound leakage, making it a discreet option for on-the-go listening."
