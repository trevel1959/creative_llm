    "**Innovative Cutting Tools**: Invent new cutting tools that don't rely on traditional blades. For example, a tool with a heated wire that expands and contracts to slice through materials like cheese, bread, or meat without tearing. The wire could be made from a durable, heat-resistant material such as metal or ceramic. ",
    "**Waterjet Cutting**: Utilize waterjet cutting machines, which are capable of slicing through almost any material. By directing a high-pressure jet of water at the object, it can create precise cuts. This method is often used in industries for its ability to cut through tough materials with minimal heat generation.",
    "**Heat Sensitive Adhesive**: Develop a special type of adhesive that becomes soft when heated and hardens again upon cooling. To cut an object, one would first apply the adhesive along the desired cut line, then heat the adhesive slightly to make it flexible enough to bend and separate the layers of the object. Once cooled, the layers would be separated cleanly without damage.",
    "**Laser Cutting**: Employ laser cutting technology, which uses a focused laser beam to vaporize material and create clean, precise cuts. Lasers can be programmed to follow specific paths, allowing for intricate designs and shapes. This method is commonly used in industries like textiles, electronics, and jewelry making.",
    "**Biodegradable Cutting Tools**: Create cutting tools made from biodegradable materials such as bamboo, wood, or plant-based plastics. These tools can be used for cutting fruits, vegetables, and other food items. They can be designed to be sharp and durable while still being sustainable and eco-friendly."
