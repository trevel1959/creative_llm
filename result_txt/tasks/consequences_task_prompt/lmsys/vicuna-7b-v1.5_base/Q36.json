    "Enhanced Survival Rates: Regenerating limbs could significantly increase survival rates for individuals who have suffered severe limb injuries or amputations. This is because regeneration allows for the restoration of function and mobility, which is often critical for survival in certain situations.",
    "Reduced Costs: The cost of prosthetics and other assistive devices can be prohibitively expensive for many individuals. Regenerating limbs could reduce these costs by eliminating the need for ongoing replacements and maintenance.",
    "Increased Workforce Participation: Regenerating limbs could allow individuals with limb differences to participate more fully in the workforce, increasing their employability and economic opportunities.",
    "Improved Military Capabilities: Regenerating limbs could enhance military capabilities by allowing soldiers to quickly recover from injuries and continue to fight. This could be particularly useful in conflicts where injuries are common.",
    "Enhanced Research Opportunities: Studying regenerating limbs could provide valuable insights into the mechanisms of limb regeneration, potentially leading to new treatments for a range of conditions, including diabetes, heart disease, and cancer."
