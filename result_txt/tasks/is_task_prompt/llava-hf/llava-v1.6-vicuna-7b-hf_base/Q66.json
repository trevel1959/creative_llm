    "A leaf, still attached to its tree, holds on tight as the tree is blown away in a storm.",
    "A leaf, still attached to its tree, watches as the tree is cut down for firewood.",
    "A leaf, still attached to its tree, waits for the right moment to fall and join the rest.",
    "A leaf, still attached to its tree, remembers a time when it was free to fly.",
    "A leaf, still attached to its tree, wonders if it will ever get to see the world from above."
