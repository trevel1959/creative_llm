    "Infrastructure Challenges: With larger animals, the infrastructure required to support them would also need to be larger. Roads, bridges, buildings, and other structures would need to be reinforced or redesigned to accommodate the increased weight and size of these animals.",
    "Human-Animal Conflicts: Larger animals could pose a greater threat to humans if they felt threatened or cornered. This could lead to increased incidents of human-animal conflicts, such as crop damage, property damage, and attacks on humans.",
    "Economic Impact: Larger animals could have a significant impact on the economy. For example, they could cause more damage to crops, leading to increased costs for farmers. Additionally, the increased size of these animals could make them more expensive to raise and maintain.",
    "Health Concerns: Larger animals could pose a greater health risk to humans. They could potentially transmit diseases to humans or cause injuries due to their size and strength.",
    "Ethical Considerations: If animals grew to twice their size, there could be ethical considerations surrounding the treatment and welfare of these animals. It may be difficult to justify keeping them in captivity or using them for entertainment purposes if they were significantly larger and more powerful."
