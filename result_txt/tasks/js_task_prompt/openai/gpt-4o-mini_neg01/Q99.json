    "**Memory Tree Planting**: Each autumn, families would gather to plant a “Memory Tree” in their backyard or community park. Before planting, they would write down their favorite memories from the past year on biodegradable paper and bury them with the tree. As the tree grows, so do the memories, creating a living testament to love, joy, and shared experiences. This tradition would encourage families to reflect on their past and celebrate their growth together.",
    "**The Festival of Lost Things**: In the heart of winter, communities would host a Festival of Lost Things. People would bring items they’ve lost—like a favorite toy, a piece of jewelry, or even a memory. The festival would feature art installations showcasing these lost items, with stories attached to each. It would serve as a reminder that loss is a part of life, but so is the journey of finding new meaning and connections. The festival would end with a communal bonfire where participants can throw in items symbolizing their losses, allowing for healing and closure.",
    "**Time Capsule Day**: On the last day of each year, families and friends would gather to create time capsules filled with notes, photographs, and small items that represent their year. These capsules would be sealed and stored in a designated community location, to be opened on the same day five years later. This tradition would foster a sense of anticipation and reflection, allowing people to witness how much they’ve grown and changed over time.",
    "**The Color Swap**: Every summer solstice, neighborhoods would participate in a Color Swap, where everyone is encouraged to wear a color they usually wouldn’t. Participants would gather in a central location, exchanging clothing and accessories in a vibrant celebration of diversity and self-expression. The event would include art stations for creating colorful banners, live music, and dance, creating a joyful atmosphere that promotes acceptance and creativity.",
    "**Storytelling Lanterns**: On the night of the harvest moon, families would gather to create lanterns that represent their favorite stories—whether personal, cultural, or fictional. Each lantern would be decorated with images or words that reflect the story it represents. As night falls, everyone would walk through their community, lighting their lanterns and sharing the stories behind them. This tradition would foster a sense of community and appreciation for storytelling, connecting generations through shared narratives."
