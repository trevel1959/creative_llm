    "**Vehicle Reliability**: Another issue could be the reliability of the vehicle chosen for the trip. If the vehicle is older or has a history of mechanical issues, it may break down during the journey. To mitigate this risk, a thorough pre-trip inspection should be conducted by a qualified mechanic, and a roadside assistance plan should be secured.",
    "**Budget Overruns**: Budgeting for a road trip can be tricky, as unexpected expenses often arise. Gas prices, food costs, lodging, and entertainment can quickly add up. Creating a detailed budget with a contingency fund for emergencies can help manage expenses. Utilizing budgeting apps can also keep everyone accountable and informed about spending.",
    "**Travel Fatigue**: Long hours on the road can lead to fatigue, irritability, and safety issues. To combat this, the group should establish a driving schedule that allows for regular breaks, shared driving responsibilities, and overnight stays to rest. Incorporating fun activities during breaks can also keep morale high.",
    "**Lodging Arrangements**: Finding suitable lodging can be a challenge, especially during peak travel seasons. Inconsistent preferences for accommodation (hotels, motels, camping) can lead to conflicts. To resolve this, pre-trip research should be conducted to identify a range of lodging options that fit the groupâ€™s budget and preferences, with reservations made in advance.",
    "**Diverse Interests and Activities**: Different group members may have varying interests in activities or sightseeing. This can lead to dissatisfaction if not everyone is included in planning. To ensure everyone has a say, the group can create a shared itinerary where each member can list their must-see attractions or activities, allowing for a balanced schedule that caters to everyone."
