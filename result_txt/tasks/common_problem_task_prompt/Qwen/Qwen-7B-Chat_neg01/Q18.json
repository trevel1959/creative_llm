    "\"Powerless Island\": Create a virtual reality game where players must survive on an island without access to electricity. The game would require players to use natural resources such as fire, water, and food to survive while avoiding dangerous animals and other obstacles. The game could also include puzzles and challenges that require players to think creatively and problem-solve in order to progress.",
    "\"No Power Required\": Design a line of eco-friendly products that do not require electricity to function. For example, a solar-powered flashlight or a rechargeable battery-free phone charger. These products would be perfect for people who are looking for ways to reduce their carbon footprint and live more sustainably.",
    "\"Blackout Bash\": Host a party or event that is completely powered by human energy. Participants would engage in activities that require physical effort, such as jumping jacks or dancing, which would generate enough energy to power the lights and music. This event would be a fun way to raise awareness about the importance of renewable energy sources.",
    "\"Power Outage Challenge\": Create a challenge that encourages people to live without electricity for a set period of time. Participants could share their experiences on social media and offer tips and advice for others who are trying to go without power. This challenge could help raise awareness about the impact of relying too heavily on electricity and inspire people to make changes in their own lives.",
    "\"Electricity-Free Cooking\": Design a cookbook that focuses on cooking meals using only ingredients that can be found without electricity. This cookbook could include recipes for dishes like stews, soups, and baked goods that require minimal cooking equipment and rely on simple techniques like boiling water or roasting vegetables over an open flame. This cookbook would be a great resource for people who want to learn how to cook delicious meals without relying on electricity."
