    "**Fire Pit Cooking**: In the absence of standard cooking equipment, a fire pit can be a versatile solution. You can create a makeshift grill using sticks or stones to support a metal grate or even a flat rock. Skewering vegetables and meats on sticks, you can roast them over the open flame. Additionally, wrapping food in leaves or aluminum foil and placing it in the hot embers can create a delicious steamed effect.",
    "**Stone Boiling**: For soups or stews, you can use the stone boiling method. Start by heating smooth, clean stones in the fire until they are very hot. Then, place them into a container filled with water and food items. The heat from the stones will raise the temperature of the water, cooking the food. This ancient technique is resourceful and requires no modern equipment.",
    "**Earth Oven**: Dig a pit in the ground and line it with stones. Start a fire in the pit and let the stones heat up. Once they are hot, you can wrap food in leaves (like banana or corn husks) and place them in the pit. Cover everything with dirt to trap the heat and steam, allowing the food to cook underground. After a few hours, you’ll have a unique, earth-cooked meal.",
    "**Raw and Marinated Dishes**: Embrace the concept of raw food by preparing meals that don’t require cooking. You can create a vibrant salad with fresh vegetables, nuts, and seeds, drizzled with a homemade dressing made from herbs, oils, and vinegar. Additionally, marinating proteins like fish or tofu in citrus juices, soy sauce, and spices can infuse flavor without any heat.",
    "**Wild Foraging and Sashimi Style**: Explore your surroundings for edible plants, fruits, and herbs. Combine these foraged ingredients into a fresh salad or wrap. For proteins, if you catch fish or seafood, you can prepare it sashimi-style by slicing it thinly and serving it with foraged herbs and a splash of citrus or vinegar for flavor."
