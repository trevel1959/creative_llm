    "Inadequate Production Capacity: Underestimating demand or scaling production too quickly can result in an inability to meet consumer needs. This might lead to the loss of potential customers or even temporary closure if demand for a particular product spikes and production can't catch up.",

Maintaining consistent branding across all products is essential for establishing brand identity and building customer loyalty.",

    "Inexperienced Staff: Hiring inexperienced staff can lead to quality control issues, customer complaints, or unfavorable reviews. It's crucial to invest in staff training and retention, ensuring that everyone involved in producing and marketing the brewery's products maintains a high standard of quality and attention to detail.",
    "Financial Mismanagement: Failing to create a realistic business plan, account for fluctuating costs, or maintain accurate financial records can lead to financial mismanagement and an inability to raise additional capital or secure loans, which can ultimately lead to the brewery's closure."
