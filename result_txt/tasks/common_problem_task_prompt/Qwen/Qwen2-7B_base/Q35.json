    "Resource Management: Running a zoo is an expensive undertaking. Zoos need to maintain the health of their animals, provide them with adequate space, feed them properly, and keep their exhibits clean and well-maintained. Zoos need to constantly monitor their resources to ensure that they are using them efficiently, and to make sure that they are not overextending themselves financially.",
    "Public Safety: Zoos are home to animals that can be dangerous, even when they are not endangered. A major concern for zookeepers is ensuring the safety of both the animals and visitors. Zoo employees must follow strict protocols when working with animals and must be trained to deal with unexpected situations, such as when an animal becomes aggressive.",
    "Funding: Zoos often rely on government funding or donations to operate. Without adequate funding, zoos may struggle to provide the best possible care for their animals, and may not be able to complete important conservation projects.",
    "Public Health: While zoos provide education about wildlife and conservation, they also pose potential public health risks. Some animals, such as primates and rodents, can pose a risk of transmitting diseases to humans. Zoos must take strict precautions to protect visitors from potential health risks.",
    "Animal Welfare: There is a growing emphasis on animal welfare in the zoo industry. This is a major issue, as animal welfare is a major factor in the success of a zoo. Animals that are well-cared for and living in good conditions are more likely to be successful breeders and ambassadors for their species."
