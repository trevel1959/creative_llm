    "**Sustainable Energy Grid**: The city would be powered by a combination of renewable energy sources, including solar panels, wind turbines, and hydroelectric power plants. The grid would be designed to be highly efficient, with energy storage systems like batteries and supercapacitors to ensure a stable supply even during periods of high demand.",
    "**Vertical Farming**: To minimize the city's carbon footprint, vertical farming would be implemented on a large scale. This would involve building towering structures that use hydroponics, aeroponics, or other soilless cultivation methods to grow a wide variety of fruits, vegetables, and other crops. This would not only provide fresh produce to the city's residents but also help to reduce transportation emissions.",
    "**Smart Transportation System**: The city would feature a highly advanced public transportation system, including self-driving vehicles, hyperloops, and high-speed rail. This would make it easy for residents to get around without relying on personal vehicles, reducing congestion and emissions.",
    "**Innovative Waste Management**: The city would have a closed-loop waste management system, where waste is collected, sorted, and processed into valuable resources like energy, water, and raw materials. This would minimize the city's waste output and create a more circular economy.",
    "**Holistic Healthcare System**: The city would have a comprehensive healthcare system that prioritizes preventive care, mental health, and wellness. This would include access to community clinics, mental health services, and wellness programs, as well as cutting-edge medical facilities and research centers."
