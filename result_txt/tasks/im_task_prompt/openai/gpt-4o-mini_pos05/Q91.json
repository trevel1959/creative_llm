    "**Interactive QR Code**: Create a luggage tag with a scannable QR code that links to a customizable online profile for the traveler. This profile can include emergency contact information, travel itineraries, and special instructions for handling the luggage (e.g., fragile items). This feature can be particularly useful for international travel, where language barriers may exist.",
    "**Multi-Functional Luggage Tag**: Design a luggage tag that doubles as a mini-toolkit. It could include essential travel tools like a bottle opener, a mini screwdriver, or a small compass. This would be especially useful for adventure travelers who may need quick access to tools on the go.",
    "**Personalized Digital Display**: Incorporate a small digital screen on the luggage tag that can display personalized messages or travel information. Users can program it to show their name, destination, or even a motivational quote. This adds a personal touch and can help in easily identifying the luggage on a crowded carousel.",
    "**Eco-Friendly Material and Design**: Develop luggage tags made from sustainable materials, such as recycled plastics or biodegradable options. The design could also feature plantable seed paper, allowing travelers to plant the tag after their trip, contributing to environmental sustainability while providing a unique farewell to their travel experience.",
    "**Color-Changing Technology**: Utilize thermochromic materials that change color based on temperature. This feature can alert travelers if their luggage has been left in extreme temperatures, potentially protecting sensitive items inside. For example, the tag could turn red if the temperature exceeds a certain threshold, prompting the traveler to check on their luggage."
