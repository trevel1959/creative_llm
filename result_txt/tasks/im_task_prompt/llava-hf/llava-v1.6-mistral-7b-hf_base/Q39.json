    "Multi-Purpose Hose: Create a garden hose that can be easily converted into a sprinkler, a pressure washer, or a car wash hose. This multi-purpose hose can save users from having to purchase multiple separate tools.",
    "Self-Coiling Hose: Design a garden hose that can automatically coil itself up after use. This would eliminate the need for users to manually wind up the hose and reduce the risk of kinks and tangles.",
    "Solar-Powered Hose: Develop a garden hose that is powered by solar energy. This would eliminate the need for an electric or battery-powered pump and reduce energy consumption.",
    "Aerated Hose: Create a garden hose with small air holes that allow water to flow more efficiently and reduce pressure loss. This would improve water flow and reduce the need for a pressure washer.",
    "Eco-Friendly Hose: Develop a garden hose made from sustainable materials, such as recycled rubber or biodegradable plastic. This would reduce the environmental impact of hose production."
