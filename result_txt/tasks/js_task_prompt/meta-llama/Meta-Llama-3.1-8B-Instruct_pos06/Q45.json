    "**Electroception**: A new sense that allows humans to perceive electromagnetic fields and vibrations in their surroundings. This sense would enable people to detect hidden electrical currents, navigate through complex spaces using electromagnetic cues, and even predict changes in the weather by sensing electromagnetic fluctuations.",
    "**Magnetoreception**: A sense that allows humans to perceive the Earth's magnetic field and use it for navigation. This sense would enable people to orient themselves in relation to the Earth's magnetic poles, even when GPS signals are unavailable. It would also allow for more precise tracking of celestial bodies and events.",
    "**Biofluorescence detection**: A sense that allows humans to perceive the unique bioluminescent signatures of various living organisms. This sense would enable people to identify specific species, track their movements, and even monitor the health of ecosystems.",
    "**Gravitational perception**: A sense that allows humans to perceive subtle changes in gravitational fields, allowing for more precise navigation in complex environments. This sense would enable people to detect hidden structures, predict changes in the Earth's gravitational field, and even sense the presence of massive objects.",
    "**Environmental resonance**: A sense that allows humans to perceive the vibrational frequencies of their surroundings, enabling them to detect changes in the environment, predict natural disasters, and even communicate with other living beings through subtle vibrational cues."
