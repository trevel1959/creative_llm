    "Vase of memories: Create a vase that holds more than just flowers. It should have compartments or small containers within the vase to store small mementos, like ticket stubs, business cards, or other small keepsakes. Whenever the owner looks at the vase, they'll be reminded of the memories associated with each memento.",
    "Vase of inspiration: Design a vase that transforms into a writing desk or a canvas. The vase's body could have a hollow interior, and the owner could use it as a desk or easel to jot down ideas or create art. As they work, the vase's design could change, inspiring new ideas and creativity.",
    "Vase of nature: Create a vase that brings the outdoors inside. The vase could be made from a natural material like bamboo or wood, and it could have small openings or slots that allow plants to grow inside. As the plants grow, they'll create a natural, organic atmosphere in the room.",
    "Vase of music: Design a vase that plays music when water is added. The vase could have a small speaker or a series of small bells inside that play a soothing melody when the water level is above a certain point. The music could be customizable, so the owner can choose their favorite tunes or create their own.",
    "Vase of time: Create a vase that changes shape or size depending on the amount of time passed. The vase could be made from a flexible material like silicone or rubber, and it could have a built-in clock or timer.
