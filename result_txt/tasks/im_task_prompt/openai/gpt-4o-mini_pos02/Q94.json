    "**Smart Candles with App Integration**:    Create candles that can connect to a smartphone app via Bluetooth. Users could control the candleâ€™s brightness, scent release, and even set timers for when they want the candle to be lit or extinguished. The app could also suggest scents based on user preferences or current weather conditions, providing a personalized aromatic experience.",
    "**Color-Changing Candles**:    Design candles that change color as they burn down. By using heat-sensitive dyes, the candle could transition through a spectrum of colors, visually indicating how much wax is left. This would not only serve as a visual cue for when to replace the candle but also create a beautiful and mesmerizing display as it burns.",
    "**Eco-Friendly Seed-Embedded Candles**:    Innovate a line of candles made from biodegradable wax that contains embedded seeds. Once the candle has burned down, the leftover wax can be planted in soil, allowing the seeds to germinate and grow into flowers or herbs. This concept combines sustainability with functionality, promoting eco-consciousness while providing a unique experience.",
    "**Layered Candles with Multi-Phase Scents**:    Create layered candles that have different scents in each layer. As the candle burns, it would transition from one scent to another, creating a multi-phase aromatic experience. For example, the top layer could be a fresh ocean breeze, the middle layer could transition to a floral bouquet, and the bottom layer could end with a warm vanilla. This would keep the burning experience interesting and dynamic.",
    "**Interactive Story Candles**:    Design candles that come with a story or theme associated with them. Each candle could have a QR code that links to an audio story or a playlist that complements the candle's scent. For instance, a \"Forest Adventure\" candle could release pine and cedar scents while playing sounds of nature or a narrated story about a woodland journey, enhancing the sensory experience."
