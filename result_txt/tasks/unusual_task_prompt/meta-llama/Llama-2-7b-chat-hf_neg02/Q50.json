    "\"The Suitcase Chronicles\": This idea revolves around creating a travel-themed interactive exhibit that takes visitors on a journey through the history of suitcases. The exhibit could feature vintage suitcases on display, along with interactive elements such as a \"packing challenge\" where visitors can try to fit as many items as possible into a miniature suitcase, and a \"passport stamp station\" where visitors can collect virtual stamps from different destinations.",
    "\"Suitcase Cinema\": This idea involves creating a mobile movie theater that travels to different locations and screens classic films in a unique and immersive setting. The suitcase theater could be equipped with a projector, screen, and comfortable seating, and could be set up in parks, plazas, or other public spaces. To add an extra touch of whimsy, the theater could be pulled by a vintage suitcase on wheels.",
    "\"Suitcase Sculptures\": This idea involves creating a series of large-scale sculptures made from repurposed suitcases. The sculptures could take on various forms, such as a giant suitcase \"tree\" with branches made from suitcase handles, or a \"suitcase mountain\" made from stacked suitcases. The sculptures could be displayed in a public park or plaza, and could be accompanied by a educational program that teaches visitors about the history and cultural significance of suitcases.",
    "\"Suitcase Stories\": This idea involves creating a storytelling project that invites people to share their own stories and memories associated with suitcases. The project could take the form of a traveling exhibit featuring vintage suitcases on display, along with audio or video recordings of people sharing their stories. The exhibit could also include a \"story station\" where visitors can record their own stories and add them to a digital archive.",
    "\"Suitcase Symphony\": This idea involves creating a musical instrument made from repurposed suitcases. The instrument could be a large, multi-piece instrument that can be played by a group of musicians, or a smaller, more portable instrument that can be taken on the go. The suitcase instrument could be used to create a unique and memorable soundtrack for a variety of events, from concerts to parades to street performances."
