    "**Turbo Snail**: Create a genetically engineered snail that has a turbo-charged shell, allowing it to move at incredible speeds. The shell would be made of a lightweight, high-strength material, and the snail's foot would be equipped with powerful muscles to propel it forward. The snail would be fed a special diet that enhances its speed and agility. (Confidence score: 0.8)",
    "**Snail Jetpack**: Develop a wearable jetpack that allows the snail to hover and move at high speeds. The jetpack would be powered by a miniature jet engine, and the snail would be able to control its direction and speed using a specialized joystick. The jetpack would also have a built-in navigation system to help the snail avoid obstacles. (Confidence score: 0.7)",
    "**Super Snail Bike**: Design a high-tech, miniature bike that the snail can ride on. The bike would be equipped with advanced gyroscopes and stabilization systems to ensure a smooth ride, even at high speeds. The snail would be able to control the bike using a specialized handlebar, and the bike would have a built-in speedometer and navigation system. (Confidence score: 0.9)",
    "**Snail Glider**: Create a lightweight, wing-like structure that the snail can attach to its shell. The glider would allow the snail to soar through the air, using rising air currents and wind to propel it forward. The snail would be able to steer the glider using a specialized rudder, and the glider would have a built-in altimeter and navigation system. (Confidence score: 0.8)",
    "**Quantum Snail**: Develop a snail that can harness the power of quantum mechanics to move at incredible speeds. The snail would be able to tunnel through solid objects, allowing it to move through obstacles and reach high speeds. The snail would also be able to manipulate its molecular structure to change its shape and size at will. (Confidence score: 0.6) [/INST] "
