    "**Multi-Zone Cooking Technology**:    This oven would feature multiple cooking zones, each with its own temperature and cooking method. Users could bake a cake on one side while simultaneously roasting vegetables on the other, each cooking at optimal conditions. This could be achieved through advanced heating elements and smart sensors that monitor the progress of each dish, ensuring everything is cooked perfectly and simultaneously.",
    "**Self-Cleaning with Eco-Friendly Technology**:    An oven that employs a combination of steam and ultrasonic cleaning technology to remove grease and food residue without the use of harsh chemicals. This eco-friendly self-cleaning feature would not only save time and effort but also be safer for the environment. Users could simply select the cleaning mode, and the oven would take care of the rest, leaving it spotless and ready for the next cooking session.",
    "**Integrated Food Dehydrator and Fermenter**:    This innovative oven could double as a food dehydrator and fermenter, allowing users to preserve fruits, vegetables, and herbs or create homemade yogurt and sourdough bread. It would have specific settings for dehydration and fermentation, complete with humidity and temperature controls, enabling users to explore a wider range of culinary techniques and preserve food in a healthy way.",
    "**Augmented Reality (AR) Cooking Guide**:    An oven equipped with an AR system that projects recipes and cooking instructions directly onto the oven door or a nearby surface. Users could see step-by-step guides, cooking times, and temperature settings while they cook. This interactive feature would enhance the cooking experience, making it easier for novice cooks to follow complex recipes or for experienced chefs to try new techniques.",
    "**Energy Harvesting Features**:    An oven that incorporates energy-harvesting technology, such as solar panels or piezoelectric materials, to generate its own energy. This would significantly reduce energy consumption and lower utility bills. The oven could also have a built-in battery system to store excess energy for later use, making it more sustainable and eco-friendly while providing cost savings to the user."
