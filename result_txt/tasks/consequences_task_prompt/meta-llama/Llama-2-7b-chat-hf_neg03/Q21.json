    "Bartering would become the primary means of exchange: Without money, people would have to rely on bartering, or exchanging goods and services directly without using money. This could lead to a more localized and community-based economy, with people trading goods and services with their neighbors and friends.",
    "New forms of currency could emerge: In the absence of physical money, people might turn to alternative forms of currency, such as cryptocurrencies or even digital tokens. These new forms of currency could offer more security and transparency than traditional physical money.",
    "The value of goods and services would be reevaluated: Without money to dictate their value, the value of goods and services would need to be reevaluated based on their actual worth to society. This could lead to a more equitable distribution of resources, as people would be able to exchange goods and services based on their true value.",
    "The concept of work would be redefined: Without money to motivate people, the concept of work would need to be redefined. People might find new ways to measure their worth and value, such as through the quality of their relationships, their impact on their community, or their personal fulfillment.",
    "Society would become more collaborative: Without the need for money, people might become more inclined to work together and share resources. This could lead to a more cooperative and supportive society, where people rely on each other for survival and well-being."
