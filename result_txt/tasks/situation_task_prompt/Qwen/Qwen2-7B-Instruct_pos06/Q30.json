    "**Synthetic Vitamins and Minerals**: In the absence of natural sources, humans could rely on synthetic supplements to obtain necessary nutrients. These would be created in laboratories using advanced chemistry techniques. This idea is highly innovative as it pushes the boundaries of modern biotechnology and chemical engineering. **Confidence Score: 0.9**",
    "**Genetically Engineered Plants**: Scientists could genetically engineer plants that produce high levels of specific vitamins and minerals not typically found in common fruits and vegetables. This approach requires significant advancements in genetic modification technology but could lead to a diverse array of nutrient-rich crops. **Confidence Score: 0.8**",
    "**Nutrient-Rich Fungi and Algae**: Developing a diet based on fungi and algae could be an alternative, as these organisms are known to contain high concentrations of various vitamins and minerals. Cultivation methods for these food sources would need to be developed and optimized. **Confidence Score: 0.7**",
    "**Insect Protein**: Insects can be a rich source of protein and other nutrients. Innovating insect farming methods could provide a sustainable and efficient way to obtain essential vitamins and minerals. **Confidence Score: 0.6**",
    "**Enhanced Animal Feed**: Modifying animal feed to increase the nutrient content of meat, dairy, and eggs could indirectly provide humans with necessary vitamins and minerals. This would require understanding the specific nutrient needs and developing specialized feed formulations. **Confidence Score: 0.5**"
