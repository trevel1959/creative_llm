    "Create a fire-resistant home design: Design your home with fire-resistant materials such as fire-resistant concrete, brick, or stone. These materials can provide an extra layer of protection against fire damage. Additionally, consider building your home with a fire-resistant roofing material such as slate or ceramic tile.",
    "Install fire-resistant windows and doors: Replace traditional glass windows and doors with fire-resistant alternatives such as tempered glass or fire-resistant acrylic. These materials can help slow the spread of fire and provide an extra layer of protection.",
    "Implement a fire-suppression system: Consider installing a fire suppression system that uses a clean agent such as carbon dioxide or a wet chemical to extinguish fires. These systems can be more effective than traditional sprinkler systems and can help prevent fires from spreading.",
    "Create a fire escape plan: Develop a fire escape plan that includes multiple escape routes from your home. Make sure to designate a meeting point outside the home where everyone can gather once they have escaped. This plan will help ensure that everyone in the home can escape safely in the event of a fire.",
    "Use fire-resistant landscaping: Plant fire-resistant vegetation around your home to help slow the spread of fire. For example, you can use plants such as succulents or cacti, which are naturally resistant to fire. Additionally, consider using fire-resistant mulch or gravel to cover your garden beds and reduce the risk of a fire spreading."
