    "**Integrated Paint Reservoir**: Design a paintbrush that includes a small, refillable paint reservoir within the handle. This would allow artists to dispense paint directly onto the bristles as they work, eliminating the need for constant dipping into a paint container. The reservoir could be equipped with a simple squeeze mechanism for easy control over the amount of paint released.",
    "**Smart Brush Technology**: Incorporate sensors into the paintbrush that connect to a mobile app. The brush could track stroke pressure, speed, and angle, providing real-time feedback and tutorials to improve the artist's technique. The app could also suggest color mixing tips and track the artist's progress over time, offering personalized advice based on their unique style.",
    "**Interchangeable Brush Heads**: Develop a paintbrush with a modular design that allows users to easily swap out different brush heads for various techniques and effects. The brush could come with a variety of head shapes (e.g., round, flat, fan) and bristle types (e.g., synthetic, natural) that can be clicked in and out, making it versatile for different painting styles.",
    "**Built-in Cleaning System**: Introduce a paintbrush with a self-cleaning feature that utilizes a small compartment with cleaning solution. After use, the artist can simply press a button to activate the cleaning mechanism, which would rinse the bristles and flush out any paint residue. This would save time and effort in maintaining the brush and prolong its lifespan.",
    "**LED Light Integration**: Add an LED light to the tip of the paintbrush that illuminates the painting surface. This feature would be particularly useful for artists working in low-light conditions or for detailed work, allowing them to see colors and textures more clearly. The light could have adjustable brightness settings and be rechargeable."
