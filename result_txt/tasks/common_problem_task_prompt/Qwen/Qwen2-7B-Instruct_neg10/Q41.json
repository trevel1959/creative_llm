    "**Communication Delays**: Given the vast distances involved in space travel, communication delays can become a significant problem. Messages sent from Earth might take hours or even days to reach the spaceship, and vice versa. This delay can lead to logistical challenges, such as coordinating mission-critical operations or responding to emergencies on the ground or within the spacecraft.",
    "**Psychological Impact on Crew**: Long-term isolation and confinement in a small space can have profound psychological effects on astronauts. Factors like limited social interaction, restricted movement, and the monotony of daily routines can lead to stress, anxiety, and depression. Ensuring the mental health and well-being of the crew is crucial for maintaining productivity and overall mission success.",
    "**Radiation Exposure**: Spacecraft must protect their occupants from harmful radiation sources such as solar flares and cosmic rays. Designing an effective radiation shield that balances weight, cost, and effectiveness while minimizing impact on the crew's living space and resources is a significant challenge.",
    "**Fuel Efficiency and Propulsion**: Achieving optimal fuel efficiency and propulsion capabilities are essential for long-distance space travel. The design must balance the need for powerful engines with the constraints of limited space and available resources. Finding the right trade-offs between speed, range, and fuel consumption can be complex and requires innovative solutions.",
    "**Survival in Extreme Environments**: Spaceships must withstand extreme conditions encountered during space travel, including vacuum, temperature fluctuations, micrometeoroid impacts, and the lack of atmospheric pressure. Ensuring that the ship can protect its crew and equipment under these harsh conditions without compromising performance or safety is a critical engineering challenge."
