    "**Rubber Hand Illusion Reversal**: In this twist on the classic rubber hand illusion, participants are placed in a room with a mirror and a fake, realistic-looking hand. However, instead of the fake hand being attached to a stationary object, it's attached to a robotic arm that can move in sync with the participant's own hand. The participant is then asked to perform a series of tasks, such as drawing or playing a musical instrument, with their real hand while the fake hand moves in sync. The goal is to create a sense of ownership and agency over the fake hand, while also exploring the boundaries of bodily awareness and the concept of self.",
    "**Virtual Reality Rubber Hand**: This idea takes the rubber hand illusion to the next level by using virtual reality (VR) technology to create a fully immersive experience. Participants wear a VR headset and are presented with a virtual environment where they see a virtual hand that is identical to their own. The twist is that the virtual hand is not just a static image, but a fully interactive and responsive avatar that can be controlled by the participant's own hand movements. The goal is to explore the limits of bodily awareness and the sense of self in a fully virtual environment.",
    "**Rubber Hand as Puppeteer**: In this idea, the rubber hand is not just a passive prop, but an active participant in a puppet show. The participant is given a set of puppets and is asked to perform a series of tasks, such as telling a story or singing a song, with the rubber hand as the puppeteer. The goal is to explore the concept of agency and control, as well as the relationship between the participant's own body and the external, artificial body of the rubber hand.",
    "**Rubber Hand as Mirror**: In this idea, the rubber hand is used as a mirror to explore the concept of self and identity. Participants are given a set of reflective surfaces, such as mirrors or glass, and are asked to use the rubber hand to create a series of self-portraits or reflections. The goal is to explore the relationship between the participant's own body and the external, artificial body of the rubber hand, as well as the ways in which we use mirrors and reflections to understand ourselves.",
    "**Rubber Hand as Proxy**: In this idea, the rubber hand is used as a proxy for the participant's own body, allowing them to explore and interact with their own body in new and creative ways. Participants are given a set of tools and materials, such as paint"
