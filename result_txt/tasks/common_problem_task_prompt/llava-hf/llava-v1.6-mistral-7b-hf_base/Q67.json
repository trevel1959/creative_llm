    "Pest Control: Effective pest control is a major challenge for organic farmers, as they cannot use synthetic pesticides and fertilizers. Organic farmers need to develop alternative solutions, such as using natural predators, crop rotation, or integrating pest management practices, which can be labor-intensive and expensive.",
    "Weeds: Weed management can be particularly challenging in organic farming. Organic farmers often rely on methods such as manual labor, cultivation, or mulching to control weeds. However, these methods can be time-consuming and labor-intensive, especially on a large scale.",
    "Crop Rotation: Organic farmers must carefully plan crop rotation to maintain soil fertility and prevent pests and diseases from becoming a problem. This requires a deep understanding of crop rotations, soil science, and pest ecology.",
    "Storage and Transportation: Organic crops are often more delicate than conventionally grown crops, requiring special storage conditions to maintain their quality. Additionally, finding suitable transportation methods that meet organic certification standards can be challenging.",
    "Marketing and Sales: Organic products often have a higher price point compared to conventionally grown produce. Organic farmers may face challenges in finding markets and customers willing to pay the higher costs of organic products."
