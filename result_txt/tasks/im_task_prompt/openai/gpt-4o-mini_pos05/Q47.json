    "**Self-Cleaning Filter Technology**: Develop a vacuum cleaner with a self-cleaning filter mechanism. This could use a combination of high-frequency vibrations and air pressure to dislodge dust and debris from the filter, preventing clogs and maintaining optimal suction power. This would reduce the frequency of filter replacements and maintenance, making the vacuum more user-friendly.",
    "**Multi-Surface Adaptive Cleaning**: Design a vacuum cleaner that can automatically adjust its cleaning settings based on the type of surface itâ€™s on. Using sensors to detect carpet, hardwood, tile, or upholstery, the vacuum would modify its suction power and brush settings for optimal performance. This would enhance cleaning efficiency and protect delicate surfaces from damage.",
    "**Eco-Friendly Cleaning Solution Dispenser**: Incorporate a built-in dispenser for eco-friendly cleaning solutions that can be used in conjunction with the vacuum cleaner. This feature would allow users to clean and deodorize surfaces simultaneously while vacuuming, using non-toxic, biodegradable solutions. The vacuum could also have refillable cartridges, promoting sustainability and reducing waste.",
    "**Pet Hair and Dander Removal Technology**: Create specialized attachments and brush heads designed specifically for homes with pets. These would feature rubberized bristles and electrostatic technology to effectively capture pet hair and dander from carpets, furniture, and hard-to-reach areas. Additionally, the vacuum could have a HEPA filtration system to trap allergens, making it ideal for allergy sufferers.",
    "**Integrated Home Monitoring System**: Equip the vacuum cleaner with sensors that monitor air quality and provide feedback on dust, allergens, and pollutants in the home. The vacuum could send alerts to the user via an app when air quality drops, prompting cleaning actions. This would not only enhance the cleaning experience but also promote a healthier living environment."
