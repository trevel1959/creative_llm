    "**Integrated Airbag System**: To provide an additional layer of protection, this helmet could incorporate a deployable airbag system. In the event of an accident, sensors would detect a sudden impact and inflate airbags around the head and neck area, reducing the risk of serious injury. The airbag could be designed to deflate after a few seconds to allow for easy removal of the helmet and access to the rider.",
    "**Modular Design for Personalization**: A modular helmet design would allow users to customize their helmets with different colors, patterns, and accessories. Components like visors, ear covers, and even built-in lights could be swapped out depending on the rider's preferences or needs for specific conditions (e.g., night riding or winter use). This would not only enhance the aesthetic appeal but also improve functionality based on the riding environment.",
    "**Built-in Communication System**: This helmet could come equipped with a Bluetooth communication system, allowing riders to connect with their smartphones or other riders. This feature would enable hands-free calling, music streaming, and even group communication with fellow cyclists. The helmet could have noise-canceling technology to ensure clear sound quality even in windy conditions.",
    "**Temperature Regulation Technology**: To enhance comfort during long rides, this helmet could include a temperature regulation system that utilizes phase change materials or built-in fans to maintain a comfortable temperature. Riders could adjust the temperature settings via an app, ensuring they stay cool during hot weather and warm during colder conditions.",
    "**Eco-Friendly Materials and Manufacturing**: This helmet could be made from sustainable, biodegradable materials, significantly reducing its environmental impact. The manufacturing process could also focus on minimal waste and energy-efficient techniques. Additionally, the helmet could feature a recycling program, encouraging users to return their old helmets for proper recycling and disposal."
