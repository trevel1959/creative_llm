    "**Biophilic Design Principles**: The city’s architecture would be rooted in biophilic design, incorporating natural elements like water features, natural light, and organic materials into buildings and public spaces. This design philosophy aims to enhance the well-being of residents by connecting them with nature, reducing stress, and improving mental health. Parks, walking trails, and wildlife corridors would be integrated throughout the city to encourage outdoor activities and biodiversity.",
    "**Community-Centric Public Spaces**: Public spaces would be designed with community engagement in mind, featuring flexible areas that can host markets, festivals, and cultural events. These spaces would be equipped with modular furniture, allowing for easy reconfiguration to accommodate different activities. Local artists and designers would be involved in the creation of these spaces, ensuring they reflect the unique culture and identity of the community.",
    "**Renewable Energy Microgrids**: The city would operate on a network of renewable energy microgrids powered by solar panels, wind turbines, and other clean energy sources. Each neighborhood would have the capability to generate and store its energy, promoting energy independence and resilience. Residents would have access to real-time energy consumption data, allowing them to make informed decisions about their usage and contribute to overall sustainability efforts."
