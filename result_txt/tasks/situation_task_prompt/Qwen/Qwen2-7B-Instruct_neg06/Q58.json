    "**Innovative Pest Management System**:    - **Idea**: Develop a system that utilizes drones for monitoring and controlling pests. These drones could be equipped with cameras for identifying pest populations and specific pheromone dispensers to disrupt their mating patterns or attract them to bait stations.",
    "**Biological Pest Control through Genetic Engineering**:    - **Idea**: Engineer non-native species that are natural predators of common pests, ensuring they do not harm humans or the ecosystem. These engineered organisms would be introduced into the environment after thorough testing in controlled conditions.",
    "**Community-Based Integrated Pest Management (IPM)**:    - **Idea**: Implement an IPM program where community members take responsibility for managing pests in their local areas. This could include education on natural pest control methods, such as using companion planting, maintaining cleanliness, and creating habitats that deter pests.",
    "**Smart Garden Design**:    - **Idea**: Create gardens designed specifically to repel or attract certain pests. This could involve planting certain flowers and herbs known for their pest-repelling properties or designing gardens with vertical structures that allow for more diverse plantings, making it harder for pests to find food sources.",
    "**Artificial Intelligence-Powered Pest Detection and Response**:    - **Idea**: Use AI to predict pest outbreaks based on environmental factors like temperature, humidity, and population density. Once an outbreak is predicted, automated systems could be deployed to treat the affected area, such as drones releasing biocontrol agents or robots applying targeted treatments."
