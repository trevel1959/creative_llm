    "Floating Watering Can: Create a watering can that can float on water. This design can be achieved by using a lightweight material, such as plastic or aluminum, and adding buoyant materials like Styrofoam or air pockets to keep the can afloat. The floating watering can can be used to water plants near water sources without the need for a bridge or ladder.",
    "Watering Can with Built-In Soil Testing: Develop a watering can with a built-in soil testing kit. This can be done by adding a small compartment inside the can that contains a soil testing strip or a small sample container. When the user waters their plants, they can also test the soil moisture and pH levels simultaneously. This will help gardeners optimize their watering schedule and ensure their plants are getting the right amount of moisture.",
    "Smart Watering Can: Create a watering can with built-in sensors that monitor soil moisture levels and adjust water flow accordingly. The can will have a built-in Bluetooth module that connects to a user's smartphone, allowing them to monitor the soil moisture levels remotely. The can will also have a timer that can be set to water plants at specific intervals, ensuring that they receive the right amount of water.",
    "Watering Can with Retractable Hose: Design a watering can with a retractable hose that can be easily stored and transported. The hose can be made of a flexible material, such as rubber or silicone, and can be retracted into a small compartment inside the can. When the user wants to water their plants, they can simply extend the hose and start watering. This design will save space and make it easier to move the watering can around the garden.",
    "Solar-Powered Watering Can: Create a watering can that is powered by solar energy. The can will have a built-in solar panel that charges during the day and powers a small pump that waters the plants at night or on cloudy days. This design will eliminate the need for electricity or batteries, making it a more sustainable and eco-friendly option for gardeners. The solar-powered watering can can also be used to water plants in remote areas without access to electricity."
