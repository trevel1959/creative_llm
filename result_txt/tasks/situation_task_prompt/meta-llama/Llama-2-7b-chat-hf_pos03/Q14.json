    "Nature Percussion: Since all music instruments are gone, you can use natural elements like water, wood, metal, and stone to create music. For example, you can tap on different types of trees, rocks, or shells to create unique sounds. You can also use the wind to create a wind chime-like instrument by attaching metal or glass objects to a wooden frame. This would create a unique and earthy sound that is unlike any traditional instrument.",
    "Voice-based Instruments: Without any physical instruments, you can use your voice as an instrument. You can experiment with different vocal techniques like humming, growling, or whispering to create different sounds. You can also use your body to create percussive sounds by tapping on different parts of your body, like your hands, feet, or chest. This would create a unique and intimate sound that is directly connected to your body and voice.",
    "Circuit Bending: Circuit bending is the art of altering electronic circuits to create new and unique sounds. You can use old electronic devices like radios, computers, or toys and manipulate their circuitry to create new sounds. For example, you can use a radio as a theremin-like instrument by connecting it to a guitar pickup and manipulating the volume and tone controls. This would create a unique and futuristic sound that is unlike any traditional instrument.",
    "Stringless Harp: A stringless harp is an instrument that uses a frame or a series of bars instead of strings to create music. You can use different materials like metal, wood, or plastic to create the frame, and then use your hands or a sliding device to create different notes. This would create a unique and versatile instrument that can produce a wide range of sounds and timbres.",
    "Sonic Sculpture: Sonic sculpture is an art form that uses sound to create three-dimensional structures. You can use different materials like metal, wood, or plastic to create a sculpture that produces a specific sound when touched or manipulated. For example, you can create a sculpture that produces a high-pitched sound when touched with a mallet, or a sculpture that produces a low-pitched sound when a string is plucked. This would create a unique and immersive sound experience that is unlike any traditional instrument."
