    "\"I would build a house using recycled materials such as old car parts, scrap metal, and repurposed plastic bottles. I would also incorporate renewable energy sources like solar panels and wind turbines to power the house.\"",
    "\"I would design a modular house that can be built in sections and assembled on-site. This would allow for flexibility in design and construction, and also make it easier to adapt to changing building codes and technologies.\"",
    "\"I would useillumination, a new technology that uses lighttraction to powertraction surfaces, to light and power the house. This would eliminate the need for electricity and reduce energy consumption.\"",
    "\"I would construct aless house, which means that the walls and roof would be made of translucent materials that allow for natural light and ventilation. This would reduce the need for artificial lighting and heating/cooling systems, making the house more energy-efficient.\"",
    "\"I would build aless house usingless materials, such asless wood and stone, which are made from recycled or repurposed materials. This would reduce waste and the environmental impact of construction, while also creating a unique and sustainable living space.\""
