    "Solar-powered devices: Devices can be powered using solar panels that can be attached to the device. This is an environmentally friendly solution that can be used to charge devices during the day.",
    "Hand-cranked devices: Hand-cranked devices are a great alternative to battery-powered devices. These devices use a small crank to generate electricity that can be used to power the device.",
    "Battery-free devices: There are many devices that are battery-free, such as wireless keyboards, mice, and game controllers. These devices use radio frequency technology to communicate with the device they are connected to.",
    "Hydrogen fuel cell devices: Hydrogen fuel cell devices use a small amount of hydrogen to generate electricity that can be used to power the device. These devices are still in the early stages of development, but they have the potential to be a viable alternative to battery-powered devices.",
    "Kinetic energy devices: Kinetic energy devices use the motion of the device to generate electricity. For example, a kinetic energy-powered phone case uses the motion of the phone to generate electricity that can be used to charge the phone. These devices are still in the early stages of development, but they have the potential to be a viable alternative to battery-powered devices."
