    "**Weather Conditions**: The weather on Everest can be unpredictable and severe. Sudden storms, high winds, and extreme cold can create dangerous conditions for climbers. These weather changes can lead to frostbite, hypothermia, or being stranded on the mountain. Climbers must be prepared with appropriate gear and must closely monitor weather forecasts.",
    "**Physical Exhaustion**: Climbing Everest is physically demanding, and climbers may experience extreme fatigue due to the strenuous nature of the ascent. This exhaustion can impair judgment and physical performance, increasing the risk of accidents. Proper training, conditioning, and pacing are crucial to managing energy levels throughout the climb.",
    "**Crowding and Traffic Jams**: In recent years, the popularity of climbing Everest has led to overcrowding on certain routes, particularly during peak climbing seasons. This can result in dangerous traffic jams, where climbers are stuck waiting for extended periods in high-risk zones, leading to exhaustion and increased chances of altitude sickness or frostbite.",
    "**Technical Climbing Skills**: While parts of the ascent can be non-technical, climbers still need to have a good grasp of technical climbing skills, especially in areas like the Khumbu Icefall or the Lhotse Face. Inadequate skills can lead to accidents, falls, or getting stuck in difficult situations. Proper training and practice in climbing techniques are essential before attempting Everest.",
    "**Mental Health Challenges**: The psychological strain of climbing Everest can be significant. Isolation, the pressure to succeed, and the fear of failure can lead to anxiety and stress. Some climbers may also experience post-climb depression after the adrenaline of the climb wears off. Mental preparation and support systems are vital to address these challenges."
