    "**Adjustable Multi-Function Hanger**: Design a hanger that can adjust its shape and size to accommodate various clothing types. It could have detachable clips for skirts and pants, as well as a foldable section for delicate items like blouses. The hanger could also include a built-in hook that rotates 360 degrees, allowing for easy access to clothes in tight spaces or closets. ",
    "**Eco-Friendly Hanger with Planting Feature**: Develop a hanger made from biodegradable materials that can be repurposed as a plant pot once its life as a hanger is over. This hanger would feature a small compartment at the bottom that can hold soil and seeds, encouraging users to plant flowers or herbs after they no longer need the hanger. This eco-friendly approach promotes sustainability and can be marketed as a dual-purpose item.",
    "**Hanger with Integrated LED Lighting**: Introduce a clothes hanger equipped with LED lights that illuminate the clothing when the closet door is opened. This feature would help users easily find and choose outfits in dimly lit areas, making it perfect for walk-in closets or small spaces. The lights could be motion-activated or have a manual switch, and the design could include a rechargeable battery to ensure energy efficiency.",
    "**Magnetic Hanger System**: Create a clothes hanger that utilizes magnets to attach to a metal strip installed in the closet. This would allow for easy rearrangement of clothing without the hassle of traditional hooks. Users could slide hangers along the strip, making it easy to organize outfits by color, season, or occasion. The magnetic feature could also enable the use of modular attachments for scarves, belts, or accessories.",
    "**Self-Cleaning Hanger**: Innovate a clothes hanger that incorporates a self-cleaning technology using UV-C light. This hanger would eliminate bacteria and odors from clothing by emitting UV light when clothes are hung. It would be especially beneficial for workout gear and outerwear, ensuring that garments remain fresh and hygienic. The hanger could have a timer and a sensor to activate the cleaning mode only when clothes are hung."
