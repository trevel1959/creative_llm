    "Educational Tool: Turn a wine glass into an educational tool by filling it with water and allowing students to observe how sound waves distort its shape. This can help explain the concept of refrains, reflection, and refraction in physics and acoustics.",
    "Science Experiment Container: Wine glasses can serve as containers for various experiments in physics, chemistry, and biology. For example, they can hold a small amount of an acid or a base to test pH levels, or even simple chemistry experiments demonstrating the effects of heat or pressure on matter.",
    "Wind Chime: Cutting wine glasses and hanging them from a string can produce a melodic clinking sound by striking them against each other. When moved in the wind, this will create an interesting and soothing sound that can be used to soothe the senses.",
    "Vase: Wine glasses can be used as vases for small flowers or plants, adding an elegant and sophisticated touch to any area of the home. To attach the plants, simply puncture a hole in the bottom of the stem and use toothpicks or wire to create a support structure.",
    "Candle Holder: For a simple yet sophisticated centerpiece, use wine glasses as holders for candles. The reflective stem will catch the flickering light and add a touch of elegance to any room."
