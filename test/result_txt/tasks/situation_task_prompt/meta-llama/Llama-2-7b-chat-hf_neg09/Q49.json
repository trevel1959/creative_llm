    "Make a fire escape plan: Develop a fire escape plan with your family, identifying at least two ways out of each room in your home. Practice the plan with your family at least twice a year, so everyone knows what to do in case of a fire.",
    "Install fire-resistant materials: Consider installing fire-resistant materials such as fire-resistant roofing, flooring, and walls. These materials can help slow the spread of a fire and give you more time to escape.",
    "Create a fire-fighting kit: Assemble a fire-fighting kit with essential items such as a fire extinguisher, a bucket of sand or baking soda, and a hose or garden hose. Keep the kit in an easily accessible location, such as in the garage or near the front door.",
    "Use non-traditional fire-fighting methods: Consider using non-traditional methods to put out a fire in your home, such as smothering the fire with a blanket or towel, or using a fire-resistant spray. These methods may be more effective than traditional fire extinguishers in certain situations.",
    "Stay informed: Stay informed about fire safety by regularly checking the local fire department's website for tips and resources, and by signing up for emergency alerts from your local government. This can help you stay prepared for a fire emergency and know what to do in case of an emergency."
