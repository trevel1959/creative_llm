    "After a fierce battle with its prey, the octopus lost one of its arms, but it managed to win the fight, giving it a sense of accomplishment",
    "The octopus with only seven arms couldn’t hold on to the rock that it had taken refuge in, and was now drifting to the open sea, where it would be eaten by sharks or other marine creatures",
    "The octopus could only reach seven of the fish, so it let them go, hoping they’d be safe enough to reproduce and repopulate.",
    "The octopus with only seven arms was an oddity among its kind, but it didn’t care about how different it was from the others, it loved going on its own way.",
    "When the octopus was born, it lost its mother’s right arm, and it struggled to fit into the family, but eventually it found its own place and was accepted."
