    "**Smart Power Strip**: Create a power strip that integrates smart technology. This would include features such as a built-in Wi-Fi connection allowing users to control their devices remotely via an app. The strip could also monitor energy usage, alerting users when appliances are using too much power or suggesting energy-efficient alternatives. It might also have a surge protector function to safeguard electronics from voltage spikes.",
    "**Charging Hub with USB-C and Qi Wireless Charging**: Develop a power strip with a mix of charging ports including USB-C for high-speed charging and wireless charging pads compatible with Qi standards. This would be ideal for modern tech-heavy spaces like offices, dorm rooms, or home entertainment areas where multiple devices need to be charged simultaneously.",
    "**Ergonomic Power Strip Stand**: Design a power strip stand that incorporates ergonomic principles to improve user comfort while charging devices. The stand could feature adjustable angles and height, padded surfaces for devices, and possibly even built-in cooling fans to dissipate heat from electronics. It can also include features like USB ports and AC outlets at various levels for easy access.",
    "**Emergency Backup Power Station**: Combine a power strip with a rechargeable battery pack that can act as an emergency backup power source during blackouts. The device would store power generated from the AC outlets and provide a portable solution for powering devices like laptops, lamps, or small appliances. It could also have an integrated flashlight or SOS signal capability for safety purposes.",
    "**Wireless Charging Power Strip with Voice Control**: Integrate a power strip with a voice-controlled smart assistant (like Amazon Alexa or Google Assistant) that allows users to manage connected devices through voice commands. This could include turning on/off lights, adjusting the volume of connected speakers, or controlling other smart home devices. The strip would feature wireless charging capabilities for smartphones or other compatible devices. "
