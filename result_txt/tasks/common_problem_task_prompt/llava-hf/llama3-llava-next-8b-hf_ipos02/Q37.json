    "Artwork Quality: Another potential problem is the quality of the artwork itself. The organizers must ensure that the artwork is of high quality and that it meets the standards set by the exhibition. Poor-quality artwork can lead to a negative impression on visitors and may detract from the overall experience of the exhibition.",
    "Accessibility: Ensuring that the exhibition is accessible to all visitors is a potential problem. This includes providing accommodations for visitors with disabilities, such as wheelchair accessibility and audio descriptions for visually impaired visitors. Failing to provide adequate accessibility may limit the number of visitors and may result in a negative experience for those who are able to attend.",
    "Insurance: Insurance is a potential problem that may arise when organizing an art exhibition. The organizers must ensure that the artwork is adequately insured to protect against damage or loss. Failing to have adequate insurance coverage may result in financial loss for the organizers and may limit their ability to protect the artwork.",
    "Marketing and Promotion: Marketing and promotion are essential for the success of an art exhibition. The organizers must ensure that they effectively promote the exhibition to attract visitors and generate interest in the artwork. Failing to effectively market and promote the exhibition may result in low attendance and a lack of interest in the artwork.",
    "Financial Constraints: Financial constraints are a potential problem that may arise when organizing an art exhibition. The organizers must ensure that they have sufficient funds to cover the costs of the exhibition, including venue rental, artwork acquisition, marketing, and insurance. Failing to have adequate funds may limit the success of the exhibition and may result in financial loss for the organizers."
