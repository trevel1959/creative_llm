    "**Desalination Solar Farms**: Set up large-scale solar farms equipped with desalination plants along coastlines. These farms would use solar energy to power the desalination process, converting seawater into fresh water. The excess energy generated could be stored in batteries or used to power local communities, creating a dual-purpose system that addresses both water scarcity and energy needs.",
    "**Fog Nets**: Implement a network of fog nets in areas where fog is prevalent. These nets would be strategically placed in high-altitude regions to capture tiny water droplets from fog. The droplets would coalesce and drip into collection troughs. This method is low-cost and requires minimal energy, making it an eco-friendly solution for communities in foggy climates.",
    "**Water Recycling Towers**: Design vertical towers that utilize a closed-loop water recycling system. These towers would collect gray water from households and businesses, treat it using advanced filtration and purification techniques, and then redistribute the clean water back into the community for non-potable uses like irrigation and toilet flushing. This would significantly reduce the demand for fresh water while promoting sustainable practices.",
    "**Rainwater Harvesting Domes**: Construct large geodesic domes that can capture and store rainwater during the rare occasions it does rain. These domes would be fitted with a filtration system to purify the water for drinking. The design could incorporate a community garden on top, where the collected rainwater is used for irrigation, creating a sustainable ecosystem that benefits both water collection and food production.",
    "**Water-Collecting Green Roofs**: Encourage urban development to include green roofs that are designed to collect and store rainwater. These roofs would be planted with drought-resistant vegetation that thrives on minimal water. The collected rainwater could be stored in tanks below the roof and used for irrigation, creating a sustainable urban environment that mitigates heat and promotes biodiversity."
