    "**Solar-Powered Roads**: Imagine roads embedded with solar panels that capture sunlight and convert it into electricity. Vehicles could be equipped with solar cells or connected to an electric grid that draws power from these roads. This would not only power electric vehicles but could also charge them while in motion, reducing the need for long charging stops.",
    "**Biofuel Innovations**: Developing advanced biofuels from non-food sources, such as algae or agricultural waste, could provide a renewable alternative to oil. Algae can produce oils that can be converted into biodiesel, and waste materials can be fermented to produce ethanol. Vehicles could be modified to run on these biofuels, promoting a circular economy and reducing waste.",
    "**Magnetic Levitation (Maglev) Vehicles**: Maglev technology, which uses magnetic fields to lift and propel vehicles, could be adapted for personal transport. This would eliminate the need for traditional fuel sources entirely. Maglev vehicles could run on electricity generated from renewable sources, providing a fast and efficient mode of transportation that minimizes friction and energy loss.",
    "**Pneumatic Transport Systems**: Vehicles could be designed to run on compressed air. By utilizing large tanks that store compressed air, these vehicles could harness pneumatic energy to drive pistons or turbines, generating motion. Compressed air can be produced using renewable energy sources, and the technology is already being tested in various applications, including buses and small delivery vehicles.",
    "**Kinetic Energy Recovery Systems (KERS)**: This system could be implemented in vehicles to capture energy during braking or deceleration. The stored kinetic energy could then be used to power the vehicle during acceleration. This method increases overall energy efficiency and reduces reliance on external power sources, making it ideal for urban environments where stop-and-go traffic is common."
