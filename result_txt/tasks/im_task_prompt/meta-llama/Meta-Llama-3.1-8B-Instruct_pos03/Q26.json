    "A trash can that doubles as a planter.  It would be a self-watering planter with a built-in recycling system.  When the user throws away trash, the can would sort the items into recyclables and non-recyclables.  The recyclables would be stored in a separate compartment, and the non-recyclables would be compacted and stored in the main body of the can.  The planter portion would be on top, with a built-in watering system that would ensure the plants receive the right amount of water.  The can would be made of a durable, weather-resistant material, such as stainless steel or recycled plastic.",
    "A smart trash can that uses AI to optimize waste management.  The can would be equipped with sensors that track the type and amount of waste being thrown away, as well as the user's recycling habits.  Based on this data, the can would provide personalized recommendations for improving recycling rates and reducing waste.  The can would also be able to detect when the user is about to throw away something that can be recycled, and would alert them to the correct recycling bin.  The can would be connected to the internet, allowing users to track their recycling progress and compete with friends and family to see who can reduce their waste the most.",
    "A trash can that generates electricity from waste.  The can would be equipped with a small generator that converts the kinetic energy from the user's trash into electricity.  This electricity would be stored in a battery and could be used to power small devices such as lights or phones.  The can would also have a built-in recycling system, allowing users to recycle their waste and generate even more electricity.  The can would be made of a durable, weather-resistant material, such as stainless steel or recycled plastic.",
    "A trash can that uses biotechnology to break down organic waste.  The can would be equipped with microorganisms that break down organic waste into nutrient-rich compost.  This compost could be used to fertilize plants, reducing the need for synthetic fertilizers.  The can would also have a built-in recycling system, allowing users to recycle their waste and generate compost.  The can would be made of a durable, weather-resistant material, such as stainless steel or recycled plastic.",
    "A trash can that uses augmented reality to educate users about waste management.  The can would be equipped with a camera and screen that displays interactive tutorials and educational content about waste management.  Users could scan a barcode on a"
