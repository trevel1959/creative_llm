    "**Hair Tie with Built-in Hair Serum**: Design a hair tie that incorporates a small, refillable hair serum reservoir. When the user ties their hair, the serum is released and evenly distributed throughout their locks, providing an instant dose of moisture, shine, and manageability. The serum could be infused with nourishing ingredients like argan oil, coconut oil, or keratin, making it a game-changer for people with dry or damaged hair.",
    "**Smart Hair Tie with Hair Analysis**: Develop a hair tie that includes a built-in sensor to analyze the user's hair health. This sensor could detect factors like moisture levels, protein content, and breakage points, providing personalized recommendations for hair care products and routines. The data could be synced to a mobile app, allowing users to track their hair's progress over time and make informed decisions about their hair care.",
    "**Hair Tie with Integrated Hair Accessories**: Design a hair tie that doubles as a hair accessory hub. The tie could have a magnetic attachment system, allowing users to easily attach hair clips, barrettes, or other small accessories. This would save space in their bag and make it easier to style their hair on-the-go.",
    "**Hair Tie with Built-in Detangling Tool**: Create a hair tie that incorporates a built-in detangling tool, such as a small comb or a gentle detangling brush. This would make it easier to style hair in the morning, reducing tangles and knots. The tool could be designed to be removable and washable, making it easy to clean and maintain.",
    "**Hair Tie with Mood-Enhancing Technology**: Develop a hair tie that incorporates mood-enhancing technology, such as a built-in LED light that changes color based on the user's emotions. The light could be programmed to respond to the user's heart rate, skin conductance, or other biometric data, providing a subtle yet effective way to boost their mood and energy levels. This could be especially useful for people who struggle with anxiety or depression."
