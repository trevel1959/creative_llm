    "**Time Management Issues**: Coordinating the cooking of multiple dishes can lead to time management challenges. Different dishes require varying cooking times and temperatures, which can create confusion and potential delays. To solve this, draft a cooking timeline that includes when to start each dish, when to preheat the oven, and when to set the table. Use timers to keep track of each dish, and enlist family members to help with simpler tasks, ensuring everything is served hot and fresh.",
    "**Dietary Restrictions**: With large families, it's common to encounter a variety of dietary restrictions, such as allergies, vegetarianism, or gluten intolerance. Not addressing these can lead to uncomfortable situations for guests. To avoid this, send out a survey or ask family members in advance about their dietary needs. Prepare a few versatile dishes that can cater to different preferences, such as a vegan-friendly option or gluten-free sides, ensuring everyone has something delicious to enjoy.",
    "**Space Limitations**: A crowded kitchen can become chaotic, especially when multiple cooks are trying to prepare dishes simultaneously. This can lead to accidents, such as spills or burns, and make it difficult to find necessary tools and ingredients. To combat this, designate specific cooking zones for each dish or assign tasks to different family members. Clear the workspace and use timers to help keep the kitchen organized and efficient. Additionally, consider using portable cooking equipment, like slow cookers or electric skillets, to free up stovetop space.",
    "**Last-Minute Changes**: Family dynamics can lead to unexpected changes, such as a guest arriving late or a dish not turning out as planned. These changes can disrupt the flow of the meal and create stress. To prepare for this, have a flexible menu that allows for easy substitutions or additions. Keep extra ingredients on hand for quick adjustments, and consider making some dishes ahead of time that can be easily reheated, so that you can adapt without losing your cool.",
    "**Serving Logistics**: Serving a large meal can become complicated, especially if there are not enough serving dishes or if the layout of the dining area makes it difficult for guests to help themselves. To streamline this process, plan the serving style in advance—whether buffet-style or family-style—and ensure there are enough serving utensils and space for guests to comfortably access the food. Consider creating a flow chart for serving to minimize congestion and ensure everyone can enjoy the meal without feeling rushed."
