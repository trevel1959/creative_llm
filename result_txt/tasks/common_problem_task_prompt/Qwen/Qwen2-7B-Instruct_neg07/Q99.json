    "**Audio-Based Virtual Reality Navigation System**: Create a wearable device that combines audio feedback with virtual reality technology to help visually impaired individuals navigate their surroundings. The device would use sensors to gather information about the environment (such as obstacles, stairs, etc.) and convert this data into an audio description. The user would wear headphones connected to the device which would provide real-time guidance on how to proceed safely. This system could also include features like voice commands for destination input and environmental analysis.",
    "**Braille-Electronic Book Reader**: Develop a portable electronic device that converts digital text into Braille for reading. The device could feature a small keyboard where users type in or copy-paste text from various sources, and it instantly converts the text into Braille on a refreshable Braille display. This would make accessing books, articles, and other written materials easier and more convenient for visually impaired individuals.",
    "**Tactile Feedback Wearable Text-to-Speech Glasses**: Design a pair of glasses that includes small actuators capable of providing tactile feedback when reading out loud. These glasses would connect to smartphones or tablets via Bluetooth and use text-to-speech technology. When the user reads aloud, the glasses would vibrate slightly at specific points in the sentence to indicate pauses, punctuation, or emphasis. This would enable users to understand the context and flow of speech without relying solely on auditory cues.",
    "**Smart Canes with Enhanced Sensor Technology**: Improve traditional white canes by integrating advanced sensor technology. The cane would have multiple sensors (infrared, ultrasonic, etc.) that detect objects, stairs, and changes in elevation. It would also incorporate GPS and mapping technology to create a detailed map of the environment, which could be accessed through a smartphone app. The cane would alert the user to potential hazards and guide them through complex environments.",
    "**Adaptive Augmented Reality Games**: Create a series of interactive games designed specifically for the visually impaired using augmented reality technology. These games would present challenges that require problem-solving skills, memory, and spatial awareness, all of which can be adapted to work with audio cues and haptic feedback. For example, a game might involve navigating through a virtual maze, identifying objects based on their sound or touch, or solving puzzles using voice commands. This not only provides entertainment but also helps improve cognitive abilities and motor skills."
