    "**Collapsible and Modular Design**: Design a laundry basket that can collapse flat when not in use, making it easier to store in small spaces. Furthermore, incorporate modular sections that can be detached and used as smaller baskets for sorting clothes by color or fabric type. This design could include color-coded compartments that snap together, allowing for customized organization.",
    "**Integrated Sorting System**: Create a laundry basket with built-in compartments that automatically sort clothes based on color, fabric type, or washing requirements. This could be achieved through a series of removable dividers that can be adjusted or removed as needed. The basket could also feature a sensor that detects fabric types and suggests the appropriate wash cycle via a connected app.",
    "**Self-Cleaning Material**: Develop a laundry basket made from a self-cleaning material that utilizes nanotechnology to break down dirt and odors. This would reduce the need for frequent washing of the basket itself, keeping it hygienic and fresh. This feature could be particularly beneficial for households with pets or young children, where spills and messes are common.",
    "**Built-in Odor Neutralizer**: Incorporate a compartment within the laundry basket that holds odor-neutralizing materials, such as activated charcoal or essential oils. This compartment could be designed to release pleasant scents while absorbing unpleasant odors, ensuring that even dirty laundry smells fresh. Users could easily refill or replace the odor-neutralizing materials as needed.",
    "**Laundry Basket with Wheels and Handle**: Transform the traditional laundry basket into a wheeled cart with a telescoping handle for easy transport. This design would be especially useful for those who have to carry their laundry up and down stairs or across long distances, making it easier to manage heavy loads without straining the back."
