    "Bio-Electric Energy: This type of energy would be generated by harnessing the electrical activity of living organisms. For example, a device could be developed that uses the electrical signals produced by the human brain to generate electricity. This could be used to power small electronic devices or even to charge batteries.",
    "Geothermal Energy: Geothermal energy is generated by harnessing the heat produced by the Earth's core. This heat can be used to generate electricity, and it is a clean and renewable source of energy. A new technology could be developed that uses geothermal energy to power homes and businesses, and it could be used in areas where traditional energy sources are not available.",
    "Wind Energy Turbines: Wind energy turbines are already used to generate electricity, but a new type of turbine could be developed that is more efficient and cost-effective. For example, a turbine could be designed that uses a combination of wind and water to generate electricity, or a turbine that uses a unique shape to capture more wind energy.",
    "Nuclear Energy: Nuclear energy is a controversial source of energy, but a new type of nuclear reactor could be developed that is safer and more efficient. For example, a reactor could be designed that uses a liquid fuel instead of solid fuel, or a reactor that uses a different type of coolant to reduce the risk of accidents.",
    "Hydrogen Fuel Cells: Hydrogen fuel cells are already used to generate electricity, but a new type of fuel cell could be developed that is more efficient and cost-effective. For example, a fuel cell could be designed that uses a different type of catalyst to increase the efficiency of the reaction, or a fuel cell that uses a different type of electrolyte to reduce the cost of production."
