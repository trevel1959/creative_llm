    "Smart Dog Leash with Automatic Tugging System: Design a smart dog leash with an automatic tugging system that helps owners regain control of their dog during walks. The system would use sensors to detect when the dog is pulling too hard and automatically tighten the leash, providing a gentle tug on the dog's collar. This would help prevent the owner from getting tired or frustrated, while also preventing the dog from pulling too hard and potentially running away.",
    "Dog Leash with Built-in Water Bottle: Create a dog leash with a built-in water bottle, providing owners with a convenient way to keep their dog hydrated during walks. The water bottle could be designed to be easily accessible and refillable, ensuring that the dog always has access to fresh water. This would be especially useful for dogs that are prone to dehydration or for owners who live in hot climates.",
    "LED Lighted Dog Leash: Design a dog leash with LED lights embedded along its length, providing a fun and safe way to walk your dog at night. The lights could be adjusted to different colors and patterns, making the walk more enjoyable for both the owner and the dog. This would be especially useful for owners who walk their dogs in low-light areas or for those who want to add a touch of personality to their walks.",
    "Dog Leash with Built-in Music Player: Create a dog leash with a built-in music player, allowing owners to play their favorite tunes during walks. The music player could be designed to be waterproof and shock-resistant, ensuring that it stays functional even in wet or rough conditions. This would be a fun way to enhance the walk experience and provide mental stimulation for the dog.",
    "Dog Leash with Customizable Training Aids: Design a dog leash with customizable training aids, such as clickers, treats, or vibrating reminders. These aids could be attached to the leash and used to help train the dog during walks. For example, the clicker could be used to mark good behavior, while the vibrating reminder could be used to signal the dog to sit or stay. This would be especially useful for owners who are training their dogs or for those who want to improve their dog's obedience."
