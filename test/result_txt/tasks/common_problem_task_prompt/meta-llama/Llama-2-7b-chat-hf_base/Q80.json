    "Biodegradable Favors: Instead of traditional wedding favors that are made of plastic or other non-biodegradable materials, consider giving your guests eco-friendly favors that will break down naturally. For example, you could give them small potted plants, seed bombs, or homemade herb or soap favors. These favors not only help reduce waste but also remind your guests of your commitment to sustainability.",
    "Solar-Powered Decorations: Instead of using traditional decorations that require electricity, consider using solar-powered decorations to add ambiance to your wedding without increasing your carbon footprint. For example, you could use solar-powered string lights, lanterns, or even a solar-powered wedding arch. These decorations will not only save energy but also create a beautiful and unique atmosphere for your special day.",
    "Compostable Wedding Dress: Instead of buying a traditional wedding dress that may end up in a landfill after the wedding, consider a compostable wedding dress made of natural materials such as organic cotton, hemp, or bamboo. These materials are biodegradable and can be composted at the end of the wedding, reducing waste and minimizing the environmental impact of your wedding attire.",
    "Local and Sustainable Food: Instead of serving traditional wedding food that may have traveled long distances and required excessive resources to produce, consider serving local and sustainable food options. This could include seasonal fruits and vegetables, locally-raised meats, or even a farm-to-table menu. Not only will this reduce your carbon footprint, but it will also support local farmers and help create a more sustainable food system.",
    "Eco-Friendly Transportation: Instead of renting traditional gas-guzzling limousines or party buses for your wedding, consider eco-friendly transportation options such as electric or hybrid vehicles, or even bicycles or electric scooters. This will not only reduce your carbon footprint but also provide a unique and fun way for your guests to get to and from the wedding."
