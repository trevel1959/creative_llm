    "**DIY Sander**: Modify a pencil sharpener by attaching it to a motor and using it to sand down rough edges or create textured surfaces on materials like wood, plastic, or even metal. The fine-toothed blades would offer a controlled method of smoothing surfaces without the need for specialized sanding tools.",
    "**Artistic Sculpture Mold**: Employ a pencil sharpener's blade in a mold-making process. Fill the hollowed-out space inside a pencil sharpener with a moldable material (such as wax, clay, or resin) and then pour it into a larger sculpture form. Once set, the blade can be removed, leaving a unique, sharp-edged texture on the sculpture.",
    "**Garden Tool**: Convert a pencil sharpener into a gardening tool by adding a long handle and a few sharpened blades to the sides. This makeshift tool can be used for creating intricate patterns in garden beds, cutting through grass or weeds with precision, or even as a decorative piece in a garden setting.",
    "**Crafting Aid**: Incorporate a pencil sharpener into crafting projects by attaching it to a base with adjustable angles. Use the sharpened blades to cut paper, fabric, or other thin materials into precise shapes or designs. This could be particularly useful for scrapbooking, card-making, or other paper-based crafts.",
    "**Personalized Jewelry**: Create custom jewelry pieces by designing molds with a pencil sharpener's blade. Pour melted metals or resin into the molds to create pendants, earrings, or bracelets with unique, sharp-edged designs that reflect the user's personal style."
