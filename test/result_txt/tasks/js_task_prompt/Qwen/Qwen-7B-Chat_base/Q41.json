    "\"No more plastic waste\": One of the biggest environmental problems we face today is plastic pollution. By making a global rule that prohibits the use of single-use plastics, we can significantly reduce the amount of plastic waste generated globally. This rule would encourage people to switch to reusable alternatives such as cloth bags, water bottles, and straws, which would have a positive impact on our planet's health.",
    "\"End all forms of discrimination\": Discrimination based on race, gender, sexual orientation, religion, or any other factor is deeply ingrained in many societies around the world. A global rule that prohibits all forms of discrimination would help create a more equitable and just world where everyone is treated with dignity and respect.",
    "\"Pay your fair share\": Many people are not contributing their fair share to society, whether it's through taxes, volunteering, or paying for public services like healthcare and education. A global rule that requires everyone to pay their fair share would ensure that resources are distributed fairly and efficiently, and that everyone has access to the basic necessities of life.",
    "\"End hunger and poverty\": Hunger and poverty are widespread issues that affect millions of people worldwide. A global rule that guarantees food security and basic income for everyone would help alleviate these problems and create a more equitable world where everyone has the opportunity to thrive.",
    "\"Promote sustainability\": Climate change and other environmental crises are threatening the future of our planet. A global rule that promotes sustainable practices such as renewable energy, conservation, and responsible consumption would help protect our natural resources and ensure a livable planet for generations to come."
