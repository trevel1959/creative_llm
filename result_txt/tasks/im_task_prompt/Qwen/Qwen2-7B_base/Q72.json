    "Incorporate a buoyancy aid on the underside of the board so that if it gets knocked down or flipped over, it will float higher out of the water and be easier to spot and retrieve.",
    "Incorporate a carry harness on the board so that it can be worn like a backpack when on land, making it easier to carry to and from the beach or surf spot.",
    "Provide a storage compartment for extra wetsuits, fins, or other gear that will be easily accessible while the surfer is on the board.",
    "Incorporate an adjustable strap system on the nose of the board so that the surfer can adjust the amount of nose rocker depending on the size and direction of the waves they will be riding.",
    "Design a board with multiple fins to improve stability and control in different types of waves, including small, medium, and large."
