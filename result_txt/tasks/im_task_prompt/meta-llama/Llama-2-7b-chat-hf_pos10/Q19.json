    "Smart Glasses for the Visually Impaired: Develop a pair of glasses with a built-in AI-powered camera and OCR (Optical Character Recognition) technology. The camera would capture images and translate them into digital text, allowing the wearer to read signs, labels, and documents with ease. The AI would also recognize faces and provide alerts when familiar faces approach, making it easier to navigate social situations.",
    "Augmented Reality Glasses for Artists: Create a pair of glasses with a see-through display that overlays digital information onto the real world. Artists could use the glasses to visualize their creations in 3D, adjust colors and shapes, and even collaborate with other artists in real-time. The glasses could also provide tutorials and suggestions to help artists improve their skills.",
    "Smart Glasses for Athletes: Develop a pair of glasses with built-in sensors that track an athlete's performance during training or competition. The sensors could measure speed, distance, heart rate, and other vital metrics, providing real-time feedback to help athletes improve their performance. The glasses could also provide virtual coaching, offering tips and strategies to help athletes optimize their performance.",
    "Glasses with Built-In Microprojector: Create a pair of glasses with a built-in microprojector that can display content onto any surface. The glasses could be used for presentations, training sessions, or even outdoor events. The microprojector would allow the wearer to project content onto a wall, table, or even a whiteboard, making it easier to communicate ideas and information to a group of people.",
    "Glasses with Personalized Lighting: Develop a pair of glasses with LED lights that can be customized to suit the wearer's mood or environment. The lights could be adjusted to provide a relaxing ambiance during a stressful meeting or to enhance focus during a long study session. The glasses could also provide a subtle alert when an important call or message arrives, without distracting the wearer."
