    "One idea to treat a common cold without medicines is to focus on rest and hydration. This means getting plenty of sleep, eating nutritious foods, and drinking plenty of fluids to help the body fight off the infection. Additionally, natural remedies such as honey, ginger tea, and lemon water can help soothe symptoms and support the immune system.",
    "Another idea is to use natural herbs and spices to help alleviate symptoms. For example, ginger and turmeric have anti-inflammatory properties that can help with congestion and sore throat, while eucalyptus and peppermint can help clear nasal passages and soothe coughs.",
    "A third idea is to use essential oils to support respiratory health. Oils such as lavender, tea tree, and oregano have antimicrobial properties that can help fight off cold-causing bacteria, while peppermint and eucalyptus can help clear nasal passages and soothe coughs.",
    "A fourth idea is to use probiotics to support the immune system. Probiotics are live bacteria and yeasts that are beneficial for our health, and they can be found in fermented foods such as yogurt, kefir, and sauerkraut.",
