    "Smart Water Bottle: Create a water bottle that can track your hydration levels, monitor your daily water intake, and provide personalized recommendations for optimal hydration. The bottle could be equipped with a small sensor that tracks your body's moisture levels and sends data to your phone or smartwatch via Bluetooth. This would help you stay on top of your hydration goals and make sure you're drinking enough water throughout the day.",
    "Aroma Water Bottle: Design a water bottle that infuses your drinking water with essential oils, herbs, or teas. The bottle could have a built-in aromatherapy diffuser that releases the fragrance of your choice into the water as you drink. This would provide a refreshing and relaxing experience, and the antimicrobial properties of the essential oils could help keep your water clean and safe to drink.",
    "Solar-Powered Water Bottle: Create a water bottle that harnesses the power of the sun to purify water. The bottle could have a built-in solar panel that charges a small battery, which powers a UV light that kills bacteria and other microorganisms in the water. This would provide a sustainable and eco-friendly way to purify water, especially when you're on the go.",
    "Temperature-Controlled Water Bottle: Design a water bottle that can keep your drinking water at the perfect temperature. The bottle could have a built-in heating or cooling element that maintains the temperature of the water to your liking. This would be especially useful for people who prefer their water at a specific temperature, such as athletes or those who suffer from temperature sensitivity.",
    "Social Water Bottle: Create a water bottle that connects with a social network of like-minded individuals who share their water consumption habits and goals. The bottle could have a built-in Wi-Fi or Bluetooth connection that syncs with a mobile app, where you can track your water intake, set hydration goals, and compete with friends or join a community of fellow hydration enthusiasts. This would provide a fun and engaging way to stay motivated and accountable with your hydration routine."
