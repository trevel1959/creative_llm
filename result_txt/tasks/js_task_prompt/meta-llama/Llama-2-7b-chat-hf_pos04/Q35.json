    "Woolly Mammoth: I would choose to bring back the Woolly Mammoth as they were highly intelligent and social creatures. They were known to have a complex communication system and were able to adapt to different environments. With their large size and strength, they could help mitigate the effects of climate change by reforestation and soil stabilization. Additionally, they could serve as a symbol of resilience and hope for the future.",
    "Quagga: I would choose to bring back the Quagga, a subspecies of zebra that went extinct in the late 19th century. The Quagga had distinctive stripes that were limited to the front half of their body, and they were known to be very social and intelligent animals. By bringing them back, we could learn more about their behavior and social dynamics, and potentially develop new methods for conservation and habitat protection.",
    "Passenger Pigeon: The Passenger Pigeon was once the most abundant bird species in North America, with an estimated population of 3 billion to 5 billion individuals. However, they went extinct in 1914 due to overhunting and habitat loss. I would choose to bring them back to raise awareness about the importance of conservation and sustainability. By studying their behavior and ecology, we could gain insights into how to better manage and protect other bird species that are facing similar threats.",
    "Thylacine: The Thylacine, also known as the Tasmanian Tiger, was a carnivorous marsupial that went extinct in the early 20th century. They were known to be highly adaptable and had a unique ability to hunt and survive in a variety of environments. By bringing them back, we could learn more about their ecological role and how they interacted with other species in their ecosystem. This knowledge could be used to inform conservation efforts and protect other endangered species.",
    "Moa: The Moa was a large flightless bird that was native to New Zealand and went extinct in the 15th century. They were known to be herbivores and could grow up to 10 feet tall and weigh over 500 pounds. By bringing them back, we could learn more about their behavior, habitat, and diet, and"
