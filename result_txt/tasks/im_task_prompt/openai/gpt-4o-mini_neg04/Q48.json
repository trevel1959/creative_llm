    "**Interactive Light-Up Keys**: Create a piano with keys that light up in different colors to indicate which notes to play. This would be particularly beneficial for beginners, as it would visually guide them through songs. The lights could also change color based on the mood of the piece, helping players to understand musical expression and dynamics.",
    "**Portable Folding Piano**: Design a lightweight, portable folding piano that can be easily transported. This piano would feature a flexible keyboard that can be rolled up or folded, making it convenient for musicians on the go. It could also have a rechargeable battery, Bluetooth connectivity, and a companion app for recording and sharing performances.",
    "**Multi-Sensory Piano Experience**: Enhance the piano experience by integrating sensory elements such as scent, vibration, and visual projections. For instance, when playing a particular piece, the piano could emit scents that correspond to the mood of the music, while gentle vibrations could provide tactile feedback. Additionally, visual projections could create an immersive atmosphere that enhances performances.",
    "**Augmented Reality (AR) Learning App**: Develop an AR app that works in conjunction with the piano to teach users how to play. When viewed through a smartphone or tablet, the app could overlay instructions, finger placements, and even virtual instructors onto the piano keys. This would create an engaging learning environment that combines traditional methods with modern technology.",
    "**Piano with Modular Attachments**: Create a piano with modular components that can be added or removed based on the player's needs. For example, attachments could include different types of key surfaces (e.g., weighted, touch-sensitive), additional pedals for varied effects, or even a small digital screen that displays sheet music or tutorials. This would allow musicians to customize their instrument for different genres or playing styles."
