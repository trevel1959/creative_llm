    "**Self-Cleaning Mechanism**: A blender that features a self-cleaning function. Users can add water and a drop of soap, select the self-clean option, and the blender will clean itself by running a cycle that dislodges stuck food particles and sanitizes the container. This would save time and effort in cleaning, making the blender more user-friendly.",
    "**Modular Blender Components**: A blender designed with interchangeable parts, such as different blades for various tasks (e.g., ice crushing, pureeing, whipping) and detachable containers of varying sizes. This modularity allows users to customize their blending experience based on their needs and encourages easy storage.",
    "**Eco-Friendly Blender**: A blender made from sustainable materials, such as biodegradable plastics or recycled metals. It could also include energy-efficient technology that reduces power consumption. Additionally, a built-in compost feature could collect organic waste during food prep, encouraging sustainable cooking practices.",
    "**Augmented Reality (AR) Display**: A blender with an integrated AR display that projects onto the counter, guiding users through recipes step-by-step. It could show the amount of each ingredient, blending times, and tips on achieving the perfect consistency, making cooking more interactive and educational.",
    "**Noise Reduction Technology**: A blender designed with advanced sound-dampening materials and engineering to minimize noise during operation. This would be particularly beneficial for early morning or late-night blending, allowing users to make smoothies or soups without disturbing others in the household."
