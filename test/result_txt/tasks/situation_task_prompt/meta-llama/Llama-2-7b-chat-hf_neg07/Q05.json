    "Build a Solar-Powered Lighting System: Create a system that harnesses the energy of the sun to provide light during the day. This could involve installing solar panels on rooftops or in gardens, which would convert sunlight into electricity that powers LED light bulbs or other energy-efficient lighting sources.",
    "Use Bioluminescent Organisms: Utilize bioluminescent organisms like fireflies or glowworms to provide light during the day. These organisms produce their own light through a chemical reaction, which could be harnessed to illuminate homes, offices, or public spaces.",
    "Develop a Light-Reflecting Material: Create a special material that can reflect light in a way that mimics the sun's rays. This material could be applied to walls, ceilings, or other surfaces to provide diffused light during the day. The material could be made from a combination of reflective metals, such as aluminum or silver, and other light-absorbing materials.",
    "Build a Sunlight-Powered Generator: Develop a generator that converts sunlight into electricity, which could be used to power lighting systems. This could involve using photovoltaic cells or other solar-powered technology to generate electricity from sunlight.",
    "Create a Daylight-Harvesting System: Develop a system that captures and stores daylight during the day, which could be released as light at night. This could involve using a combination of mirrors, lenses, and light-absorbing materials to focus and concentrate sunlight, which could then be stored in batteries or other energy storage devices."
