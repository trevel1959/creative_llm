    "**Virtual Reality Driving Simulator Wheel**: Create a high-tech steering wheel that integrates with virtual reality technology. This would allow drivers to practice driving in various environments, from city streets to rural highways, without leaving their homes. The wheel could simulate different road conditions, traffic scenarios, and even weather changes, enhancing safety skills through realistic training.",
    "**Energy Harvesting Steering Wheel**: Design a steering wheel that utilizes kinetic energy from the driverâ€™s movements to generate electricity. This innovative steering wheel could be used to power onboard electronics like the car's infotainment system, lighting, or even charge a portable device. It would be an eco-friendly solution that encourages active engagement while driving.",
    "**Emotional Response Steering Wheel**: Implement a steering wheel that incorporates facial recognition and emotion detection technologies. The wheel could adjust its sensitivity or features based on the driver's emotional state.
