    "The first consequence of developing the ability to clone extinct animals would be the revival of species that have been lost for centuries. This would have a significant impact on the ecosystem and could potentially lead to an imbalance in the natural order.",
    "Cloning extinct animals could also lead to a greater understanding of their behavior, biology, and evolution. Scientists could study these cloned animals in their natural habitats and gain insights into how they lived and interacted with their environment.",
    "However, cloning extinct animals could also raise ethical concerns, such as the question of whether it is right to bring back species that have been extinct for a long time. There could also be concerns about the impact on the environment and the potential for overpopulation.",
    "Another consequence of cloning extinct animals could be the development of new technologies that could be used for other purposes, such as medical research or biotechnology.",
    "Cloning extinct animals could also have a significant impact on the tourism industry. People could visit zoos or wildlife parks to see and interact with these long-lost creatures, which could generate revenue and create jobs."
