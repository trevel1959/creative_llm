    "**Portable Solar Umbrella**: Design a compact, wearable umbrella that utilizes solar panels to charge a built-in battery. This battery powers a miniature heating system, keeping you warm in cold weather. In hot weather, the umbrella's built-in cooling system, utilizing phase-change materials, would keep you cool. The umbrella's structure would be lightweight, waterproof, and wind-resistant, providing protection from the elements.",
    "**Smart Tarp Suit**: Develop a full-body tarp suit made from a waterproof, breathable material like Gore-Tex. The suit would have built-in temperature regulation, using phase-change materials to absorb and release heat as needed. The suit would also feature a built-in ventilation system, ensuring airflow and preventing moisture buildup. The tarp suit could be easily donned and doffed, providing quick protection from the elements.",
    "**Aerodynamic Windbreaker**: Design a windbreaker that uses advanced aerodynamics to reduce wind resistance. The windbreaker would feature a streamlined shape, with a curved design that deflects wind and rain. The fabric would be lightweight, water-repellent, and breathable, keeping you dry and comfortable. The windbreaker could be easily stowed away in a compact pouch when not in use.",
    "**Thermal Blanket Wrap**: Create a thermal blanket wrap that utilizes advanced insulation materials to retain body heat. The wrap would be made from a lightweight, breathable material that traps warm air next to the skin, keeping you warm in cold weather. In hot weather, the wrap could be easily removed or used in a reflective mode to help regulate body temperature.",
    "**Smart Fabric Socks**: Develop socks made from a smart fabric that regulates body temperature. The socks would feature built-in temperature sensors, which would trigger the release of heat or cold from phase-change materials embedded in the fabric. The socks would also have built-in moisture-wicking properties, keeping your feet dry and comfortable. The smart fabric would be breathable, lightweight, and quick-drying, making it ideal for various activities and environments. [/INST] "
