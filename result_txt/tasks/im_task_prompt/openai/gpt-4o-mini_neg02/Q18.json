    "**Eco-Driving Mode**: Integrate a system that analyzes driving habits and provides feedback on how to drive more efficiently. This could include real-time suggestions on speed adjustments, braking techniques, and optimal routes based on traffic patterns. The system could gamify eco-driving by rewarding drivers with points that could be redeemed for discounts on fuel or maintenance services.",
    "**Personalized Climate Control**: Develop a climate control system that uses biometric sensors to detect the preferences of each passenger. The system could adjust temperature, airflow, and even scent based on individual preferences, ensuring everyone in the car has a comfortable experience. Additionally, it could learn over time and adjust settings automatically based on the time of day or weather conditions.",
    "**Integrated Health Monitoring**: Equip cars with health monitoring features that can track vital signs like heart rate and stress levels through wearables or seat sensors. If the system detects high stress or fatigue, it could suggest taking a break, play calming music, or adjust the interior lighting. This feature could be particularly beneficial for long-distance drivers.",
    "**Modular Interior Design**: Design a car interior that allows for modular components, enabling owners to easily customize and rearrange the seating and storage layout. For instance, seats could be removed or transformed into a lounge setup for road trips, or a workspace for those who work remotely. This flexibility would cater to different lifestyles and preferences.",
    "**Autonomous Delivery Mode**: Incorporate a feature that allows the car to autonomously deliver packages or groceries while the owner is at work or running errands. The owner could simply input the delivery address and schedule, and the car would navigate to the location, making deliveries without needing the driver to be present. This would save time and provide convenience."
