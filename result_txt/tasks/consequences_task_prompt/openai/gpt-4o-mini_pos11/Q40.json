    "**Economic Shift**: The healthcare industry would undergo a massive transformation. With diseases cured, the focus would shift from treatment to prevention, wellness, and lifestyle management. New industries could emerge, focusing on holistic health, mental well-being, and fitness technology. However, the pharmaceutical industry might face severe economic challenges, potentially leading to job losses and a need for re-skilling workers in new health-related fields.",
    "**Ethical Dilemmas in Longevity**: As people live longer, questions surrounding the ethics of longevity would arise. Society would need to grapple with issues like the distribution of resources, the quality of life in old age, and whether it is ethical to prolong life indefinitely. This could lead to debates on assisted dying, the right to die, and the responsibilities of the healthcare system to support an aging population.",
    "**Environmental Impact**: A healthier population could lead to increased consumption and waste production, putting further pressure on the environment. The demand for more goods, transportation, and energy could exacerbate climate change and deplete natural resources. This would necessitate a shift toward sustainable practices and technologies to minimize the ecological footprint of a larger, healthier population.",
    "**Shift in Social Dynamics**: The eradication of diseases could lead to changes in social dynamics and relationships. With less fear of illness, people may engage more in social activities, leading to stronger community bonds. However, it could also result in new forms of inequality based on access to wellness resources and lifestyle choices, creating a divide between those who prioritize health and those who do not.",
    "**Innovation in Health Technologies**: The focus on maintaining health rather than treating diseases could spur unprecedented innovation in health technologies. Wearable devices, personalized medicine, and AI-driven health management systems could become mainstream. This could lead to improved health outcomes, but also raise privacy concerns regarding health data and the potential for discrimination based on health metrics."
