    "**Accessible Adventure Park**: Design an amusement park specifically for wheelchair users, incorporating rides, games, and attractions that cater to different abilities. This could include modified versions of popular rides, such as a wheelchair-friendly roller coaster or a \"zero-gravity\" experience that uses special equipment to simulate weightlessness without leaving the ground. The park would also feature accessible pathways, rest areas, and interactive exhibits that can be enjoyed by people in wheelchairs.",
    "**Smart Wheelchair Navigation System**: Develop a system that integrates artificial intelligence (AI) to help individuals navigate their environment more efficiently. This could involve sensors on the wheelchair that detect obstacles and provide real-time guidance, adjusting speed and direction automatically. Additionally, the system could utilize GPS technology to guide users through complex environments like large buildings or unfamiliar outdoor spaces, ensuring they reach their destination safely and quickly.",
    "**Virtual Reality Rehabilitation Center**: Create a virtual reality (VR) platform that allows individuals to undergo rehabilitation exercises in a controlled, immersive environment. Users could perform physical therapy exercises designed by healthcare professionals, which would be tailored to their specific needs and progress. The VR setting could simulate various real-world scenarios, making the rehabilitation process more engaging and motivating.",
    "**Inclusive Fitness Program**: Launch a fitness program that accommodates people with varying mobility levels, including those using wheelchairs. The program could offer a range of activities such as strength training, yoga, and dance classes adapted for wheelchair users. This would not only improve physical health but also foster a sense of community among participants who might otherwise feel isolated due to their mobility challenges.",
    "**Ergonomic Wheelchair Modification Service**: Offer a service where specialized technicians modify existing wheelchairs to better suit the individual user's needs. This could include customizing the seating, adding assistive devices, improving the steering mechanism, or integrating technology like electric motors or voice-controlled interfaces. By providing personalized modifications, this service would enhance the comfort, control, and independence of wheelchair users."
