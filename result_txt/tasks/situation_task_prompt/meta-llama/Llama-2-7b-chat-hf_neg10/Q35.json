    "Build a pedestrian-only city: Imagine a city where cars are banned and only pedestrians are allowed. You could create a network of pedestrian-only paths, streets, and intersections that are designed for safe and efficient walking. This would encourage people to walk more and get exercise, while also reducing traffic congestion and air pollution.",
    "Develop a teleportation device: Instead of relying on bicycles or cars, imagine a world where you can teleport from one place to another. This could be achieved through advanced technology that uses quantum entanglement or other exotic phenomena to transport people instantly. This would eliminate the need for any form of transportation, including bicycles.",
    "Create a virtual reality transportation system: In a world where virtual reality technology has advanced to the point of near-singularity, you could create a virtual reality transportation system that allows people to travel anywhere in the world without ever leaving their living room. This could be achieved through the use of advanced VR headsets and haptic feedback technology that simulates the sensation of movement.",
    "Build a network of underground tunnels: Imagine a network of underground tunnels that crisscross the city, allowing people to travel quickly and efficiently without ever having to encounter traffic. These tunnels could be powered by renewable energy sources, such as solar or wind power, and could be designed to accommodate various forms of transportation, including bicycles, skateboards, and even electric vehicles.",
    "Develop a personal teleportation device: Instead of relying on a shared transportation system, imagine a personal teleportation device that allows you to travel anywhere you want, instantly. This could be achieved through advanced nanotechnology that can manipulate matter at a molecular level, allowing you to teleport yourself from one location to another. This would eliminate the need for any form of transportation, including bicycles."
