    "**Fog Nets**: Create large, mesh-like nets that can be installed in areas where fog is common. These nets would capture tiny water droplets suspended in the fog, which would then coalesce and drip down into collection troughs. This method is already used in some arid regions, and expanding its use could provide a sustainable water source without relying on traditional rainfall.",
    "**Desalination Drones**: Design drones equipped with desalination technology that can fly over oceans and collect seawater. These drones would use solar power to operate and could be programmed to convert the seawater into freshwater through reverse osmosis. The collected freshwater could then be distributed to nearby communities in need, ensuring a steady supply of water even without rain.",
    "**Water-Absorbing Surfaces**: Innovate building materials that can absorb moisture from the air and release it as liquid water. These materials could be integrated into roofs or walls of homes and public buildings. They would function similarly to sponges, capturing humidity during the day and releasing it at night when temperatures drop. This technology could provide a passive water collection system, especially in urban environments.",
    "**Hydroponic Gardens**: Establish hydroponic gardens that recycle water through a closed-loop system. These gardens could be equipped with water-efficient technologies, such as drip irrigation and moisture sensors, to minimize water loss. The plants would absorb the water they need, and excess water could be collected and reused, creating a sustainable food and water source even in drought conditions.",
    "**Ice Harvesting from the Polar Regions**: Organize expeditions to the polar regions to harvest ice and transport it to areas suffering from water shortages. This ice could be melted and purified for drinking water. This method would require careful planning and investment in transportation logistics, but it could provide a significant source of freshwater for regions that have lost access to rainfall."
