The body of this figure would be depicted as one continuous line, without any distinct divisions or separations, symbolizing how all humans are interconnected and share a common humanity. This design can be versatile and easily recognizable across different cultures.",
    "**Interlocking Hands**: This symbol features two hands interlocked, palm to palm, in a gesture of mutual support and trust. The hands are designed to be slightly abstracted to allow for easy recognition and interpretation, but the concept remains clear - peace comes from the cooperation and collaboration between people.",
    "**The Universal Compass**: Imagine a compass where each needle represents a different cultural perspective or value system, all converging at a central point. This design visually represents how, despite diverse backgrounds and beliefs, people can find common ground and work towards peace when they come together.",
    "**Nature-Inspired Wholeness**: This symbol draws inspiration from natural elements such as leaves, branches, or vines, intertwining seamlessly without beginning or end. It symbolizes growth, continuity, and the idea that peace is a continuous process, not an endpoint. The use of earthy colors can further emphasize the connection to nature and sustainability.",
    "**A Global Puzzle**: This idea involves a puzzle piece that is slightly altered, perhaps with rounded edges or a unique shape, fitting perfectly into a larger, complete puzzle. The altered piece represents the individuality and uniqueness of every culture or nation, while still emphasizing their importance in achieving global peace. The completed puzzle symbolizes unity and the collective effort required to solve the complex challenges of our world."
