    "Create a shelter: The first thing I would do is find or create a shelter to protect myself from the elements. I would look for natural formations like caves, rock overhangs, or fallen trees that could provide some shelter from the wind, rain, and sun. If I can't find any of these, I would use my survival skills to construct a lean-to shelter using branches, leaves, and other available materials.",
    "Find a source of fresh water: Finding a source of fresh water is crucial for survival. I would search for streams, rivers, or ponds, or I would collect rainwater using a tarp or a container. I would also learn how to purify water using solar disinfection, boiling, or other methods to make it safe to drink.",
    "Start a fire: Fire is essential for warmth, cooking, and signaling for help. I would learn how to start a fire using flint and steel, bow drill, or other methods. I would also keep a fire starter kit with me, including matches, a lighter, or a flint and steel.",
    "Find food: I would search for edible plants, fruits, and berries on the island. I would also learn how to fish and hunt using basic tools like a spear or a net. I would also try to catch insects and small animals like crabs, lizards, or snakes for food.",
    "Create a signal fire: To signal for help, I would build a fire on a hill or a high point on the island. I would also use any available materials to create a signal fire, such as branches, leaves, or clothing. I would also use a mirror or any reflective surface to reflect sunlight towards any passing aircraft or boats during the day."
