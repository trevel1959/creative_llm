    "**Supply Chain Disruptions**:    - **Explanation**: Food trucks rely on a consistent supply of fresh ingredients, which can be affected by seasonal changes, supplier issues, or natural disasters. To counteract this, owners can establish relationships with multiple suppliers, consider local sourcing to reduce dependency on distant vendors, and develop a flexible menu that allows for substitutions based on ingredient availability.",
    "**Vehicle Maintenance and Reliability**:    - **Explanation**: A food truck is essentially a mobile kitchen, and any mechanical failure can halt operations, leading to lost sales and frustrated customers. Regular maintenance checks, having a contingency plan for breakdowns, and possibly investing in a secondary vehicle for emergencies can help keep the business running smoothly.",
    "**Market Saturation and Competition**:    - **Explanation**: In urban areas, food trucks may face stiff competition from other food trucks and established restaurants. To stand out, entrepreneurs should conduct thorough market research to identify gaps in the local food scene, create a unique selling proposition (USP), and leverage social media to build a loyal customer base before launching.",
    "**Staffing Challenges**:    - **Explanation**: Hiring and retaining skilled staff can be difficult, especially during peak hours or events. High turnover can lead to inconsistent service quality. To address this, owners can invest in comprehensive training programs, create a positive work environment, and offer competitive wages and incentives to retain employees.",
    "**Weather Dependence**:    - **Explanation**: Food truck sales can be significantly impacted by weather conditions. Rain, snow, or extreme heat can deter customers from dining outside. To combat this, food truck owners could invest in portable canopies or heaters to create a comfortable outdoor dining space and diversify their sales strategy by offering delivery or catering services during inclement weather."
