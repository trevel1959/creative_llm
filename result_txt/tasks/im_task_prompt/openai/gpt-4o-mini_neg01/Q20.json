    "**Self-Cleaning Mechanism**: Introduce a self-cleaning feature that uses a combination of steam and vinegar or a special cleaning solution to automatically clean the internal components of the coffee maker. This would not only improve the longevity of the machine but also enhance the flavor of the coffee by preventing old coffee oils from tainting new brews.",
    "**Sustainable Materials**: Design the coffee maker using biodegradable or recycled materials, such as bamboo or recycled plastics. This eco-friendly approach could appeal to environmentally conscious consumers and promote sustainability in kitchen appliances.",
    "**Modular Design**: Create a modular coffee maker where users can swap out parts depending on their needs. For example, a single-serve module for quick cups, a French press module for those who enjoy a rich brew, or a cold brew module for summer months. This versatility would cater to various coffee preferences without needing multiple machines.",
    "**Built-in Grinder with Bean Preservation**: Incorporate a high-quality burr grinder that allows users to grind their beans fresh for each brew. Additionally, add a vacuum-sealed compartment to store beans, preserving their freshness longer and enhancing the overall flavor of the coffee.",
    "**Coffee Experience Enhancer**: Add features that enhance the coffee-drinking experience, such as a built-in frother for lattes, a heated cup warmer, or even an aroma diffuser that releases coffee-related scents while brewing to engage multiple senses and create a more immersive experience."
