    "Once upon a time in the misty valley of Draconia, there lived a dragon named Zephyr who had an unusual problem: he sneezedâ€”often and explosively! Each time he sneezed, plumes of colorful smoke filled the sky, painting rainbows that delighted the villagers below. However, Zephyr's sneezes also sent nearby trees tumbling and startled the sheep. Determined to help, the villagers crafted a gigantic tissue from enchanted leaves. When Zephyr sneezed into it, the tissue absorbed the magic, transforming his sneezes into gentle breezes. From then on, Zephyr became the valley's gentle guardian, spreading joy without the chaos of his mighty sneezes.",
