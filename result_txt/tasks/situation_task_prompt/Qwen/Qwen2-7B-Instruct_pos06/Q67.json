    "**Satellite Observation System:** Develop a high-resolution satellite system that can track atmospheric conditions directly. The satellites would monitor temperature, humidity, wind patterns, and solar radiation to predict weather changes. Confidence Score: 0.9",
    "**Oceanic Data Analysis:** Implement a network of ocean buoys that collect data on sea surface temperature, salinity, and currents. Changes in these parameters can indicate upcoming weather events such as storms or heatwaves. Confidence Score: 0.85",
    "**Ground-Based Sensor Networks:** Establish an extensive ground-based sensor network across various elevations and geographical locations. These sensors would gather data on temperature, pressure, and humidity. By analyzing this data, one could predict weather patterns without relying on clouds. Confidence Score: 0.9",
    "**AI-Powered Atmospheric Modeling:** Create an advanced AI model trained on historical weather data, including cloud behavior, temperature, and other atmospheric factors. The AI would learn to predict weather changes based on current conditions, even without direct cloud observation. Confidence Score: 0.88",
    "**Infrared Imaging Technology:** Develop an infrared imaging system that can detect temperature differences in the atmosphere to identify potential weather fronts. By tracking these temperature variations, meteorologists could predict weather changes without clouds. Confidence Score: 0.9"
