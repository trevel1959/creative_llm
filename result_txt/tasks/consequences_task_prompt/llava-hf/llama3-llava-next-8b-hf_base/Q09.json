    "The atmosphere would be less dense, as the reduced gravity would cause gases to expand and disperse more quickly. This could lead to a change in the Earth's climate and weather patterns.",
    "The oceans would be less dense, and their surface would be less stable. This could lead to a change in the Earth's tectonic plates and the formation of new land masses.",
    "The Earth's rotation would slow down, as the reduced gravity would cause the planet to lose angular momentum. This could lead to a change in the length of the day and the way the planet's seasons are experienced.",
    "The Earth's magnetic field would be weaker, as the reduced gravity would affect the movement of molten iron in the planet's core. This could lead to a change in the planet's magnetic field and its impact on the solar system.",
    "The Earth's interior would be less stable, as the reduced gravity would affect the cooling and cooling of the planet's core. This could lead to a change in the planet's internal structure and the way it responds to external forces."
