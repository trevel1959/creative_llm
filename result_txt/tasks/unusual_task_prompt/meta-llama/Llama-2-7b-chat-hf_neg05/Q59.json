    "Garden Hose with a Twist: Create a garden hose with a built-in watering can. The hose can have a detachable canister at one end that can be filled with water and then released to provide a precise amount of water for plants. This would be especially useful for those who struggle with over-watering or under-watering their plants.",
    "Smart Garden Hose: Develop a garden hose with built-in sensors that can detect the moisture levels in the soil and adjust the water flow accordingly. This would help gardeners avoid over-watering and ensure that their plants receive the right amount of water. The sensors could also detect pH levels and adjust the water accordingly to provide the optimal growing conditions for plants.",
    "Glow-in-the-Dark Garden Hose: Create a garden hose with a special coating that absorbs light and emits a glow in the dark. This would make it easier for gardeners to find their hose in the dark, especially in large gardens or during nighttime watering. The glow-in-the-dark feature could also be a fun and unique selling point for gardeners who want to add some personality to their garden.",
    "Retractable Garden Hose: Design a garden hose with a retractable cord that allows gardeners to easily store and transport the hose. The cord can be made of a durable material that can withstand being coiled and uncoiled multiple times without breaking. This would be especially useful for gardeners who have limited space in their garden or who need to transport their hose to different areas of their property.",
    "Self-Watering Garden Hose: Create a garden hose with a built-in water reservoir that can be filled with water and then released to plants as needed. This would be especially useful for gardeners who have limited mobility or who want to ensure that their plants receive a consistent supply of water. The reservoir could be filled with water from a traditional water source or through a separate irrigation system."
