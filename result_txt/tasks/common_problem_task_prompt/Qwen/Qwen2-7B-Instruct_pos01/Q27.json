    "**Vaccine Nanobots**: Create nanobots that can be ingested orally or injected into the body. These bots are programmed to detect the specific antigens of the new disease and trigger an immune response without needing a traditional vaccine strain. They would be designed with a smart-release mechanism that activates upon encountering the target pathogen, delivering targeted treatment. **Confidence Score**: 0.9",
    "**Gene Editing Vaccines**: Develop vaccines that include gene editing technology, which can introduce protective genes directly into the genome of cells within the body. This would allow the body to produce antibodies against the new disease as if it had been naturally exposed to it. **Confidence Score**: 0.85",
    "**AI-Powered Personalized Vaccines**: Use AI algorithms to analyze genetic information, lifestyle factors, and environmental exposures of individuals to create personalized vaccines tailored to each person's unique risk profile. The vaccine would be optimized to target the specific strains of the new disease most likely to affect that individual. **Confidence Score**: 0.9",
    "**Vaccination through Food**: Engineer food products that act as vaccines when consumed. These could be fortified foods or supplements that contain specific nutrients or compounds that stimulate the immune system to fight off the new disease. **Confidence Score**: 0.8",
    "**Microbial Biofilms Vaccines**: Create vaccines in the form of microbe-based biofilms that encapsulate beneficial bacteria. These biofilms could be engineered to express antigens from the new disease, thereby stimulating an immune response. The use of live but harmless bacteria would offer a natural and potentially more effective way to train the immune system. **Confidence Score**: 0.87"
