    "Cybersecurity Risks: Self-driving cars rely heavily on computer systems and connectivity to function. As a result, they may be more susceptible to hacking and cyber attacks. This could compromise the safety and security of the vehicle and its occupants.",
    "Privacy Issues: The data collected by self-driving cars, such as location information, driving habits, and other personal information, could potentially be used to profile and target individuals for marketing purposes or other forms of data exploitation. This raises questions about the appropriate use of this data and the need for clear privacy policies.",
    "Ethical Considerations: Self-driving cars may be programmed to prioritize the safety of the driver over the safety of pedestrians, leading to difficult ethical decisions in the event of a collision. This raises questions about the moral responsibility of the car's manufacturer and the drivers who use it.",
    "Infrastructure and Regulation: Self-driving cars require dedicated infrastructure, such as separate lanes for their operation, and clear regulations to ensure their safe and efficient functioning. The lack of these elements could lead to confusion and potential accidents.",
    "Dependence on Technology: Self-driving cars rely heavily on advanced technology, which could fail or malfunction in certain situations. This raises questions about the reliability of these vehicles and the need for backup systems in case of failures."
