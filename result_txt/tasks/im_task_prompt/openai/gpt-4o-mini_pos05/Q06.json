    "**Self-Cleaning Umbrella**: Design an umbrella with a special coating that repels water and dirt. This would ensure that the umbrella remains clean and dry even after being used in heavy rain. The material could be similar to hydrophobic surfaces used in some clothing and would allow users to simply shake off water or wipe it down easily without the need for washing.",
    "**Portable Charging Umbrella**: Incorporate solar panels into the canopy of the umbrella to harness solar energy while it is being used. This energy could then be stored in a small battery within the handle, allowing users to charge their devices on the go. The umbrella could feature USB ports for charging smartphones, tablets, or other electronic devices.",
    "**Wind-Resistant Design with Adaptive Canopy**: Create an umbrella that features an adaptive canopy that can adjust its shape and tension based on wind conditions. Using a combination of flexible materials and sensors, the umbrella would automatically close or change its angle to prevent it from flipping inside out during strong gusts of wind, providing enhanced durability and ease of use.",
    "**Integrated LED Lighting**: Equip the umbrella with built-in LED lights along the ribs and under the canopy. This would provide illumination during nighttime walks or when visibility is low. The lights could be powered by a small rechargeable battery, and users could switch them on with a button on the handle. Additionally, the lights could change colors based on weather conditions (e.g., blue for rain, yellow for sun).",
    "**Multi-Functional Umbrella with Built-in Seat**: Design an umbrella that features a foldable seat integrated into the handle. This would be ideal for outdoor events, parks, or festivals, allowing users to have a portable resting spot while also providing shade or protection from rain. The seat could be made from lightweight materials and easily fold away when not in use."
