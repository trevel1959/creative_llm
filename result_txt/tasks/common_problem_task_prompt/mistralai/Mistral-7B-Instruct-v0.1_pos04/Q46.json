    "Implementing a Smart Traffic System: A smart traffic system could be implemented to optimize the flow of traffic and reduce congestion. This system would use sensors and data analytics to gather information about traffic patterns and adjust traffic lights and other traffic management systems in real-time. This would help to reduce travel times, improve the reliability of public transportation, and reduce the number of accidents caused by congested traffic.",
    "Developing a High-Tech Bus System: A high-tech bus system could be developed that uses advanced technology to improve the efficiency and convenience of public transportation. This system could include features such as real-time tracking, mobile apps, and contactless payment systems. This would make it easier for passengers to plan their trips, track their buses in real-time, and pay for their rides without having to carry cash.",
    "Creating a Hybrid Transportation System: A hybrid transportation system could be developed that combines the benefits of different modes of transportation. This could include buses, trains, and bike-sharing programs. This would provide passengers with more options and make it easier for them to choose the mode of transportation that best suits their needs.",
    "Implementing a Public-Private Partnership: A public-private partnership could be established to fund and manage the overhaul of the public transportation system. This would involve partnering with private companies to develop and implement new technologies, as well as to provide funding for the project. This would help to ensure that the overhaul is done efficiently and effectively, and that it meets the needs of the community.",
    "Developing a Multi-Modal Transportation System: A multi-modal transportation system could be developed that allows passengers to travel between different modes of transportation seamlessly. This could include buses, trains, and bike-sharing programs, as well as other modes of transportation such as water taxis and electric scooters. This would provide passengers with more options and make it easier for them to travel between different parts of the city."
