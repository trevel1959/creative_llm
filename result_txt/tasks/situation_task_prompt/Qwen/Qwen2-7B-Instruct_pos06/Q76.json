    "**Use traditional communication methods**: In this scenario, you could revert to more traditional methods of communication such as sending letters through the postal service or using carrier pigeons. These might seem old-fashioned, but they can still work effectively over long distances. Letters would take longer to deliver than phone calls, but they can still convey detailed information. Carrier pigeons are another interesting option, especially if you have a reliable flock at your disposal. The confidence score for this idea is 0.9.",
    "**Invent a new wireless technology**: Imagine creating a new type of wireless communication that doesn't rely on satellites or cellular towers. This could involve developing a form of wireless transmission that uses the Earth's ionosphere or other natural phenomena to carry signals. For example, you might use radio waves reflected off the ionosphere to transmit messages across the globe. This would require extensive research and development, but it's a highly innovative approach. The confidence score for this idea is 0.85.",
    "**Develop an underwater messaging system**: If land-based communications are no longer functional, you could focus on developing a system for communicating through water. This could involve creating underwater drones or submarines that carry messages from one location to another. Alternatively, you might invent a new form of sonar communication that allows devices to transmit data through water without needing direct physical contact. The confidence score for this idea is 0.75.",
    "**Utilize quantum entanglement for communication**: Quantum entanglement could provide a unique way to communicate over long distances even when traditional systems fail. By creating pairs of entangled particles, you could send messages by manipulating one particle, which would instantly affect the other, regardless of the distance between them. This method would be highly secure and efficient, though it would require a significant understanding of quantum physics. The confidence score for this idea is 0.8.",
    "**Innovate a time-shifted communication network**: Imagine developing a system where information is sent ahead in time to be received after a specific delay. This would allow you to communicate in real-time despite the lack of current technology. To implement this, you could create small satellites that are placed just outside our solar system, enabling them to relay messages between distant planets. While this idea seems far-fetched, advancements in space exploration and timekeeping technology could make it feasible in the future. The confidence score for this idea is 0.65."
