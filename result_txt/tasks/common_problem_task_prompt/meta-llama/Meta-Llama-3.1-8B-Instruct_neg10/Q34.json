    "**Dependence on Human Labor**: Relying on a robot for tasks could lead to a decrease in human labor skills, making people less employable in the long run. To address this, education and training programs could be implemented to ensure humans can still perform tasks efficiently.",
    "**Cybersecurity Threats**: As robots become increasingly connected to the internet, they may become vulnerable to cyber attacks, compromising their functionality and potentially leading to data breaches. Implementing robust security measures, such as firewalls and encryption, would be crucial.",
    "**Social Isolation**: The increasing reliance on robots for tasks could lead to social isolation, as people spend more time interacting with machines than with other humans. Encouraging social interaction and community engagement could help mitigate this issue.",
    "**Job Displacement**: The introduction of robots could lead to job displacement, as tasks are automated and humans are no longer needed. Governments and companies could implement programs to retrain workers and provide support for those affected.",
    "**Liability and Accountability**: As robots become more autonomous, questions arise about liability and accountability in the event of an accident or malfunction. Clear guidelines and regulations would be necessary to establish responsibility."
