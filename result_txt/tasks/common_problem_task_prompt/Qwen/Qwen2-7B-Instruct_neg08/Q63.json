    "**Social Media Relay Challenge:** Start by creating a unique hashtag for your campaign, like #CancerFightFunds or #EndCancerTogether. Create a series of short videos that highlight the impact of cancer on people's lives. Each video can be a personal story, an expert's insight, or a simple statistic about cancer prevalence. Share these videos on various social media platforms and encourage viewers to share them with their followers. For every view, like, or share, donate a certain amount to the cancer research fund. This creates a viral effect while spreading awareness and generating funds.",
    "**Virtual Marathon for Cancer Research:** Organize a virtual marathon where participants can run, walk, cycle, or swim any distance they choose within a set timeframe (e.g., a week). Participants pay an entry fee, and they can also raise additional funds by asking friends and family to sponsor them based on their chosen activity. Use online platforms to track progress, share stories, and create a sense of community among participants.",
    "**Global Art Auction:** Collaborate with artists from around the world to create original pieces inspired by themes related to cancer research, such as resilience, hope, or healing. Host an online auction where people can bid on these unique works of art. Partner with art galleries or museums to help promote the event and attract more bidders. A percentage of the proceeds goes directly to the cancer research fund.",
    "**Crowdfunding with a Twist:** Develop a crowdfunding platform specifically for cancer research projects. Allow researchers, medical professionals, and patients to pitch their ideas and secure funding from the public. Implement a feature where donors can connect with the projects they support, fostering a sense of personal investment in the outcome. Encourage creativity and innovation by offering prizes or recognition for the most impactful projects.",
    "**Global Talent Show:** Organize a virtual talent show featuring performers from different countries and cultures. Charge an entry fee for participants and encourage viewers to donate to the cancer research fund through a dedicated page. Partner with well-known celebrities or influencers who can help promote the event and attract high-profile contestants. Offer prizes to the winners, such as mentorship opportunities, performance slots at major events, or exclusive content deals, which can further boost donations and engagement."
