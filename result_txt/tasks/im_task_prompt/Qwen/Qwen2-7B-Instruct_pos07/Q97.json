    "**Smart Dog Leash System**: Create a smart leash equipped with GPS tracking, activity monitoring, and a two-way communication system. The leash can send alerts to your smartphone when your dog moves beyond a certain distance from you or if it senses any unusual activity (like aggressive behavior). It also has a built-in camera that captures photos or videos of your dog's surroundings while on walks.",
    "**Adjustable and Expandable Leash**: Design a leash that adjusts according to your dog's size as it grows. This could be achieved through an expandable mechanism that allows the leash length to increase or decrease automatically. Additionally, the leash can connect to other leashes, making it easy to control multiple dogs simultaneously during walks or training sessions.",
    "**Biodegradable Dog Leash**: Develop a leash made from eco-friendly materials like natural fibers, recycled plastics, or biodegradable compounds. This reduces the environmental impact of pet ownership, particularly when disposing of old leashes. Moreover, the leash can come with a small pocket to carry poop bags, promoting responsible pet care.",
    "**Reflective Safety Leash**: Introduce a leash that incorporates high-visibility reflective materials, making it easier to see your dog at night or in low-light conditions. This is especially important for ensuring safety during evening walks. The leash could also feature LED lights that are activated by motion or a button, further enhancing visibility.",
    "**Customizable Leash with Personalized Designs**: Offer a customizable leash where customers can choose from a variety of colors, patterns, and even upload their own designs. This allows dog owners to express their personal style and create a unique accessory for their pet. Each leash could come with a QR code that links to a page where users can view and modify their design before finalizing the order."
