    "Artistic Display: Create a stunning sculpture using plastic bottles as the primary material. You could arrange them in a visually appealing way to form a 3D art piece that showcases their unique shapes and colors. You could also add other materials like glitter, paint, or even small objects to enhance the overall aesthetic.",
    "Aquatic Habitat: Transform plastic bottles into an underwater world by creating a miniature aquarium using them. You could fill the bottles with water, add decorations like rocks, plants, and small fish, and create a miniature ecosystem. This would not only showcase the versatility of plastic bottles but also raise awareness about the importance of marine conservation.",
    "Lighting Fixture: Create a unique lighting fixture using plastic bottles as the primary material.

This would not only add a touch of elegance to any room but also showcase the potential of repurposing waste materials.",
    "Musical Instrument: Turn plastic bottles into a one-of-a-kind musical instrument.

You could also add mallets or other playing tools to create a unique sound experience.",
    "Geodesic Dome: Create a geodesic dome using plastic bottles as the primary material. You could cut the bottles into triangular shapes and then connect them to form a dome-like structure.
