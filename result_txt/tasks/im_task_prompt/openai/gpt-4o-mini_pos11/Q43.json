    "**Self-Cleaning Feature with Eco-Friendly Solutions**: Enhance the self-cleaning feature of ovens by incorporating eco-friendly cleaning solutions that use steam and natural ingredients like vinegar and baking soda. This would not only reduce the need for harsh chemicals but also promote a healthier kitchen environment. Users could set the oven to self-clean at a scheduled time, allowing them to come back to a sparkling clean appliance.",
    "**Multi-Function Cooking Modes**: Introduce a variety of cooking modes that cater to different cuisines and cooking techniques. For example, a \"Sous Vide\" mode that maintains precise low temperatures, a \"Fermentation\" mode for yogurt and bread dough, and a \"Dehydration\" mode for making snacks like dried fruits and jerky. Each mode would have preset temperatures and times to simplify the cooking process.",
    "**Interactive Recipe Assistant**: Embed an interactive recipe assistant within the ovenâ€™s control panel. This feature would allow users to input ingredients they have on hand, and the oven would suggest recipes that can be made with those ingredients. It could also provide step-by-step cooking instructions, adjusting cooking times and temperatures automatically based on the selected recipe.",
    "**Modular Oven Design**: Create a modular oven system where users can customize their oven setup based on their cooking habits. For example, a user could add a steam oven module for baking bread or a pizza oven module for high-temperature cooking. This modularity would allow for personalization and adaptability, catering to various cooking styles and preferences.",
    "**Air Quality Monitoring**: Incorporate an air quality monitoring system that detects smoke, steam, and other airborne particles produced during cooking. The oven could automatically adjust its ventilation system to ensure optimal air quality in the kitchen. Users would receive alerts if the air quality falls below a certain threshold, promoting a healthier cooking environment."
