    "Overcrowding: All of humanity would live in a confined space, leading to overcrowding, and a shortage of essential resources like food, water, and housing. This could also lead to increased crime rates, as more people would compete for limited resources.",
    "Economy: A single world city would become an economy of immense size, which could lead to market dominance by a few corporations. This would result in higher prices for goods and services, stagnant wages, and reduced consumer choice.",
    "Transportation: With more than 7 billion people living in one city, transportation would become a major issue. The roads, highways, and public transport systems would be overwhelmed, leading to gridlock, pollution, and a shortage of available infrastructure.",
    "Mental Health: The psychological stress of living in a single city with millions of people could lead to increased mental health issues, such as anxiety, depression, and stress-related disorders.",
    "Security: Protecting a city with a population of this magnitude would become a challenge for any government. Security threats would increase, including terrorism, organized crime, and cybercrime, as people from all walks of life would come together in one place."
