    "A tape measure that doubles as aiumiumium. It can detectium andium particles in the air and display them on the tape measure.",
    "A tape measure that uses augmented reality to provide additional measurements. When you scan aiumnodium with your phone,iumnodium displays additional measurements such as the length of the tape measure in centimeters andiumnodium.",
    "A tape measure that uses a magnetic strip to keep it from bending. The magnetic strip is attached to the back of the tape measure and holds it in place whileiumnodiumium is being measured.",
    "A tape measure that uses a built-in flashlight to illuminateiumnodium. This is particularly usefuliumnodium in dark areas or when measuring in low light conditions.",
    "A tape measure that uses a built-in level to ensure that the measurement is straight. This is particularly useful when measuring in areas where the ground is not level, such as on a sloping surface."
