    "**Sustainable Brew Pods**:    Develop a line of biodegradable coffee pods that not only decompose quickly but also contain seeds of various plants. Once the coffee is brewed, the used pod can be planted in soil to grow herbs or flowers. This would promote sustainability and encourage users to engage with their environment. Additionally, the coffee maker could include a feature that automatically collects and compacts used pods for easy disposal or planting.",
    "**Personalized Aroma Diffuser**:    Incorporate a built-in aroma diffuser that releases scents corresponding to the coffee being brewed. For instance, when brewing a rich dark roast, the machine could emit a hint of chocolate or nutty aromas, enhancing the overall experience. Users could select from a range of aroma options, or the machine could automatically sync with the coffee type to provide a multisensory experience.",
    "**Integrated Milk Frother and Flavor Infuser**:    Create a coffee maker that includes a detachable milk frother that also infuses flavors into the milk. Users could choose from a variety of flavored syrups or natural extracts that the frother would mix into the milk while heating and frothing it. This feature would allow for customizable lattes and cappuccinos without the need for separate flavoring syrups, streamlining the coffee-making process.",
    "**Interactive Touchscreen Interface**:    Replace traditional buttons with a sleek, interactive touchscreen that allows users to customize their coffee experience in real-time. The interface could display brewing tutorials, coffee recipes, and even a virtual barista to guide users through the process. Users could also save their favorite recipes and access a community feature to share tips and tricks with other coffee enthusiasts.",
    "**Self-Cleaning Mechanism**:    Implement a self-cleaning feature that uses ultrasonic waves and a specialized cleaning solution to keep the internal components of the coffee maker clean without requiring disassembly. This would not only save time for the user but also ensure that the coffee's flavor remains pure by preventing build-up of oils and residues. The machine could alert users when a cleaning cycle is needed, ensuring optimal performance."
