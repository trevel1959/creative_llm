    "**Ecosystem Collapse**: Without animals, ecosystems would collapse, leading to the loss of plant species, soil degradation, and a decrease in water quality. This would have a ripple effect on the entire food chain, causing widespread extinction of plant and animal species. Confidence: 0.95",
    "**Loss of Medicinal Resources**: Many animals provide medicinal resources, such as venom, hormones, and antibodies, which are used to develop life-saving treatments. Without these animals, we would lose access to these vital resources, potentially leading to a decline in human health. Confidence: 0.92",
    "**Disruption of Nutrient Cycles**: Animals play a crucial role in nutrient cycles, such as decomposing organic matter, dispersing seeds, and pollinating plants. Without them, these cycles would be disrupted, leading to a decline in soil fertility and plant growth. Confidence: 0.9",
    "**Increased Greenhouse Gas Emissions**: Animals help regulate greenhouse gas emissions by consuming and storing carbon dioxide. Without them, these emissions would increase, exacerbating climate change and its associated impacts on ecosystems and human societies. Confidence: 0.88",
    "**Loss of Cultural Significance**: Animals have cultural, spiritual, and symbolic significance for many human societies. Their extinction would lead to a loss of cultural heritage, traditional practices, and community identity. Confidence: 0.85"
