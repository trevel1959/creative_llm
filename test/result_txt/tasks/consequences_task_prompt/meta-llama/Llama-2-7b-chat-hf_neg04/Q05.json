    "Political tensions: On the other hand, a shared language could also exacerbate political tensions, as different nations may feel threatened by the loss of their cultural identity. This could lead to conflicts and power struggles, as nations try to maintain their distinctiveness in the face of a universal language.",
    "The rise of a global lingua franca: With everyone speaking the same language, a new global lingua franca could emerge, potentially replacing existing languages.
