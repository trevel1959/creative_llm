    "Find a source of fresh water: The first thing I would do is search for a source of fresh water. This could be a stream, river, or a freshwater spring. I would collect and store water in a container, making sure to purify it before drinking it to avoid waterborne illnesses.",
    "Build a shelter: Next, I would look for materials to build a shelter. This could be a hut made of palm fronds, branches, and vines, or a cave if there is one nearby. The shelter would provide protection from the elements, such as rain, wind, and sun.",
    "Start a fire: Fire is essential for survival, as it provides warmth, light, and a way to cook food. I would look for dry wood and other flammable materials to start a fire. I would also learn how to make a fire without matches or a lighter, such as using a magnifying glass to focus the sun's rays.",
    "Find food: I would search for edible plants and fruits, such as coconuts, berries, and seaweed. I would also try to catch fish and other sea creatures using a makeshift fishing net or spear. I would avoid eating anything that is not safe for consumption to avoid getting sick.",
    "Signal for help: To increase my chances of being rescued, I would create a signal fire or use a mirror to reflect sunlight towards any passing boats or planes. I would also use any available materials to create a signal flag or message."
