    "**Bicycle-Driven Water Filtration System**: Use the bicycle's movement to power a water filtration system on its frame. A small pump could be attached that captures kinetic energy from pedaling and converts it into electricity to filter water through a purifying system, making clean water accessible in areas lacking such facilities.",
    "**Bicycle-Powered Food Truck**: Turn a bicycle into a mini food truck by installing a small kitchen setup on the frame, complete with a grill, stove, sink, and storage for ingredients and finished dishes. This would be ideal for street food vendors looking to minimize costs and environmental impact.",
    "**Bicycle-Driven Sound System**: Attach a sound system to the bicycle that plays music, announcements, or educational content as the user pedals. This can be particularly useful for promoting local events, spreading awareness about community issues, or simply providing entertainment in public spaces.",
    "**Bicycle-Driven Art Installation**: Create an art installation where bicycles are used to generate electricity. Pedaling on a special device connected to a generator can charge batteries or directly power lights, speakers, or other electronic components. This could be displayed at festivals or public parks to demonstrate renewable energy.",
    "**Bicycle-Driven Charging Station**: Build a charging station that uses the kinetic energy from bicycles to charge devices like smartphones, tablets, or laptops. Pedal-driven generators can provide a sustainable way for people to charge their electronics while out and about, reducing reliance on traditional power sources."
