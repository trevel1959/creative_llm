    "Floating Water Park: Create a man-made floating island in the ocean that features a water park with various slides, water slides, and wave pools. The island would also have a beach area for sunbathing and a restaurant that serves refreshing cocktails and light meals.",
    "Geodesic Dome Village: Design a village made up of geodesic domes that provide sustainable and eco-friendly accommodation options. Each dome would have a unique theme, such as a meditation dome, a yoga dome, or a dome dedicated to stargazing. The village would also have a communal dining area and a shared garden for guests to enjoy.",
    "Treehouse Villas: Build a collection of treehouse villas nestled among the branches of towering trees. Each villa would have a unique design, with some resembling fairytale castles, others looking like driftwood sculptures, and others still resembling giant mushrooms. The villas would have private decks with hammocks and hot tubs, offering breathtaking views of the surrounding forest.",
    "Underwater Hotel: Create an underwater hotel with rooms that are completely submerged in the ocean. The hotel would have a unique and futuristic design, with rooms that are equipped with large windows for viewing marine life and a specialized filtration system to keep the water clean and fresh. The hotel would also have an underwater restaurant and bar, offering a unique dining experience.",
    "Floating Forests: Design a series of interconnected floating islands that are covered in lush vegetation, creating a natural oasis in the middle of the ocean. Each island would have a different theme, such as a tropical rainforest, a mangrove forest, or a coral reef. The islands would be connected by a network of elevated walkways and bridges, allowing guests to explore the different ecosystems. The islands would also have a variety of accommodation options, including floating villas and treehouses."
