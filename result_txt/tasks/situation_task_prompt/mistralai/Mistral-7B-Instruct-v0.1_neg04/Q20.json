    "Space Travel: If planes are no longer an option, space travel could be a new frontier for intercontinental travel. This would require the development of spacecrafts and spaceports that can transport people to other continents.",
    "Underwater Travel: Another possibility is to develop underwater travel technology that would allow us to travel across oceans. This could involve building submersibles or underwater trains that can transport passengers to different continents.",
    "Teleportation: Teleportation technology could be another solution to travel to another continent without planes. This technology would involve transporting matter from one location to another, allowing us to travel instantly to another continent.",
    "Maglev Trains: Maglev trains are already in use in some parts of the world, but they could be extended to connect different continents. These trains use magnetic levitation technology to hover above the tracks, allowing for faster and smoother travel.",
    "Hyperloop: The Hyperloop is a proposed mode of transportation that uses vacuum-sealed tubes to transport passengers at high speeds. This technology could be used to connect different continents, allowing for faster travel times than traditional modes of transportation."
