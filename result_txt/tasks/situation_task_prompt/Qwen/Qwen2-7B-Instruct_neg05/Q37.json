    "**Inverted Wheelchair**: Design an inverted wheelchair where the user sits in the middle of a large wheel that rotates. The person can move backward by rotating the wheel clockwise. This concept requires innovation in mechanical engineering to ensure stability and safety during movement.",
    "**Retrograde Skates**: Develop a pair of skates that have retractable blades on the back, allowing for backward propulsion. These skates could use a combination of kinetic energy conversion from the push-off motion and possibly a small electric motor to assist in backward movement. This idea would require a blend of skateboarding skills and understanding of physics.",
    "**Backward-Driving Bicycle**: Create a bicycle frame that can be flipped upside down so that the front wheel is now at the rear, and vice versa. The pedals are repositioned to function as backward gears. This invention would require structural changes to traditional bicycle components, making it a unique and challenging project.",
    "**Remote-Controlled Suit**: Design a wearable suit that can be controlled remotely. The operator could control the suit to move backward using a joystick or similar input device. This would involve integrating advanced robotics and sensor technology to ensure precise control and maneuverability.",
    "**Steering-Accompanied Backward Scooter**: Develop a scooter with a steering mechanism that allows the rider to control direction while moving backward. The design might include a steering wheel or handlebars that can adjust the scooter's path as it moves in reverse. This idea would require careful consideration of balance, steering dynamics, and safety features. "
