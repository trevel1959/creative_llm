    "**Liability and Insurance Challenges**: In the event of an accident involving a self-driving car, determining liability can become complicated. Is it the manufacturer, the software developer, or the owner responsible? This ambiguity could lead to legal disputes and affect insurance policies. The insurance industry may need to develop new frameworks to assess risks and premiums for autonomous vehicles, requiring collaboration between lawmakers, manufacturers, and insurers.",
    "**Ethical Decision-Making**: Self-driving cars may face scenarios where they must make ethical decisions, such as choosing between the safety of passengers and pedestrians. For instance, if an accident is unavoidable, should the car prioritize the lives of its occupants or others on the road? This dilemma raises questions about the moral algorithms programmed into these vehicles and the societal values they reflect, necessitating public discourse and ethical guidelines for developers.",
    "**Dependence on Technology**: As people become more reliant on self-driving cars, there may be a decline in driving skills among the general population. If individuals no longer practice driving, they may become less capable of handling situations that require manual control, such as in emergencies or when technology fails. This could lead to a generation of drivers who are ill-prepared for traditional driving, increasing the risk of accidents when human intervention is needed.",
    "**Regulatory Hurdles**: The introduction of self-driving cars into the market will require new regulations and standards to ensure safety and efficacy. Governments may struggle to keep pace with technological advancements, leading to a patchwork of laws that vary by region. This inconsistency could create confusion for manufacturers and consumers alike, hindering the widespread adoption of autonomous vehicles and complicating cross-border travel.",
    "**Public Acceptance and Trust**: Many people may be skeptical about the safety and reliability of self-driving cars. Incidents involving autonomous vehicles could erode public trust, making individuals hesitant to embrace this technology. Manufacturers will need to engage in effective public relations campaigns, demonstrating the safety features and benefits of self-driving cars, as well as providing transparent data on performance and accident rates to build consumer confidence."
