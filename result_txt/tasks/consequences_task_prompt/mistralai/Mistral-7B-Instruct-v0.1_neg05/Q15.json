    "A shift towards renewable energy sources: If oil ran out, the world would be forced to rely more heavily on renewable energy sources like wind, solar, and geothermal power. This would lead to a significant reduction in greenhouse gas emissions, as these sources produce little to no carbon emissions.",
    "Economic upheaval: Oil is a critical component of the global economy, and a shortage of it could lead to widespread economic upheaval. Industries that rely heavily on oil, such as transportation and manufacturing, would be severely impacted, leading to job losses and decreased economic growth.",
    "Increased focus on conservation: With oil becoming scarce, people would likely become more focused on conserving natural resources. This could lead to increased efforts to protect natural habitats and wildlife, as well as a greater emphasis on sustainable agriculture and land use practices.",
    "Increased use of alternative transportation methods: If oil ran out, people would have to find alternative ways to get around. This could lead to a significant increase in the use of electric vehicles, bicycles, and other forms of transportation that don't rely on fossil fuels.",
    "Increased use of nuclear power: Nuclear power is another source of energy that doesn't rely on fossil fuels. If oil became scarce, it's likely that countries would turn to nuclear power as a more reliable source of energy. However, this could also lead to increased concerns about nuclear safety and the potential for nuclear accidents."
