    "**Orbital Debris Collision**: As the number of satellites in orbit increases, so does the risk of collision with space debris. This poses a significant threat to the satellite's operational life and can create additional debris, compounding the problem. To address this, implementing advanced tracking systems to monitor space debris and designing satellites with collision avoidance systems could be beneficial.",
    "**Regulatory Compliance**: Launching a satellite involves navigating complex international regulations and obtaining necessary permits. Failure to comply with these regulations can lead to legal issues or delays in launch schedules. To overcome this, engaging with legal experts and ensuring all paperwork is in order well in advance of the launch date is crucial.",
    "**Communication Systems Failure**: Once in orbit, maintaining communication with the satellite is vital for its operation. Any failure in the communication systems can hinder the satellite's functionality. To prevent this, redundancy in communication channels and regular testing of ground control systems can help ensure a reliable connection.",
    "**Power Supply Issues**: Satellites rely on solar panels or other power sources for operation. A malfunction in the power system can lead to a complete failure of the satellite. To counter this, designing backup power systems and incorporating energy-efficient technologies can help maintain power supply even in adverse conditions.",
    "**Thermal Control Challenges**: In the harsh environment of space, satellites face extreme temperatures that can affect their components. Without effective thermal control, satellites may overheat or freeze, leading to operational failures. Implementing advanced thermal insulation and active thermal control systems can help regulate temperatures and protect sensitive equipment."
