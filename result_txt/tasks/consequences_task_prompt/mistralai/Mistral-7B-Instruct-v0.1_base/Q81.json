    "Immortality: If humans could change their biological age at will, they could theoretically become immortal. By continuously rejuvenating their bodies, they could live forever without the effects of aging. However, this would also mean overpopulation and depletion of resources, leading to societal collapse.",
    "Superhuman Abilities: With the ability to change their biological age, humans could potentially gain superhuman abilities. For example, they could have increased strength, agility, and endurance, allowing them to perform feats that were previously impossible. However, this could also lead to a divide between those who have undergone the procedure and those who haven't, leading to social unrest.",
    "Longevity: Humans could also use this technology to live much longer than they currently do. This could lead to a population explosion and a strain on resources, leading to societal collapse.",
    "Genetic Engineering: With the ability to change their biological age, humans could also potentially use genetic engineering to enhance their abilities. For example, they could increase their intelligence, creativity, and problem-solving skills. However, this could also lead to a divide between those who have undergone the procedure and those who haven't, leading to social unrest.",
    "Time Travel: If humans could change their biological age at will, they could potentially use this technology to travel through time. This could lead to a better understanding of history and the future, but it could also lead to unintended consequences and the manipulation of the timeline."
