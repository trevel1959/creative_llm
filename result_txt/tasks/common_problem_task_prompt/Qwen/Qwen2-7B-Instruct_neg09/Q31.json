    "**\"Future Flashbacks\"** - Imagine if you could send yourself short clips from the future about your present decisions.

You could use fictional \"future selves\" to give advice or feedback on your current actions, creating an engaging dialogue between past, present, and future versions of you.",
    "**\"Parallel Lives\"** - Explore the idea of alternate realities based on different decisions made throughout your life.

This could involve role-playing different versions of yourself and other characters, examining how slight changes can lead to vastly different outcomes.",
    "**\"Decision Diaries\"** - Dive into the decision-making process for everyday choices and major life decisions. Share insights, strategies, and the emotional aspects of making tough choices.

    "**\"Time Loop Tales\"** - Inspired by the concept of time loops, create a series of stories where characters repeatedly relive the same day, facing the same challenges and making the same decisions, only to find small changes or new outcomes each time.
