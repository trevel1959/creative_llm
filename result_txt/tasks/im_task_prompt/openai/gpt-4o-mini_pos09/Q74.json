    "**Self-Watering System**:    - **Description**: Design a watering can with a built-in reservoir that allows for a self-watering feature. It would have a small valve that releases water gradually into the soil over time, similar to a drip irrigation system.",
    "**Ergonomic Design with Adjustable Spout**:    - **Description**: Create a watering can with an ergonomic handle that can be adjusted for comfort and a spout that can change its angle and flow rate. Users can switch between a gentle sprinkle for delicate seedlings and a strong pour for larger plants.",
    "**Color-Coded Watering Levels**:    - **Description**: Incorporate a transparent section or a built-in level indicator with color codes on the watering can. The colors would indicate how much water is left and the optimal amount needed for different plant types (e.g., green for adequate, yellow for caution, red for low).",
    "**Multi-Functional Watering Can**:    - **Description**: Design a watering can that can also serve as a fertilizer dispenser. It would have a compartment for liquid fertilizers that could be mixed with water as needed, with a switch to toggle between plain water and fertilized water.",
    "**Solar-Powered Heating Feature**:    - **Description**: Create a watering can with a built-in solar panel that heats the water inside. This feature is particularly useful for colder climates where plants benefit from warm water."
