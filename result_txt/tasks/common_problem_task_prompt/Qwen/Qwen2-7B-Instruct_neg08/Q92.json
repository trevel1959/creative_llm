    "**Cultural Appropriation and Sensitivity**: Another problem could be the risk of cultural appropriation, where tourists might disrespect local customs, traditions, or religious practices. It's crucial to educate both the tourist and the local population on the importance of respecting cultural differences and promoting mutual understanding.",
    "**Economic Dependence**: Tourism can sometimes lead to an economy overly dependent on the industry, which might struggle during off-peak seasons or face economic downturns if the industry declines. Diversifying the economy through other sectors such as agriculture, technology, or services can help mitigate this issue.",
    "**Infrastructure Overload**: Rapid growth in tourism might outpace the cityâ€™s infrastructure, leading to traffic congestion, lack of adequate public transport, or inadequate accommodation options. This can deter visitors and affect the overall tourist experience.",
    "**Environmental Degradation**: Tourism can contribute significantly to environmental degradation through pollution (air, water, and land), destruction of natural habitats, and overuse of resources. Implementing sustainable tourism practices, such as eco-friendly hotels, responsible wildlife viewing, and reducing plastic usage, can help manage these impacts.",
    "**Local Community Displacement**: Increased tourism can lead to rising property prices, forcing local residents to move out of their homes. This not only affects the community but also reduces the authenticity of the destination by removing local influence and culture."
