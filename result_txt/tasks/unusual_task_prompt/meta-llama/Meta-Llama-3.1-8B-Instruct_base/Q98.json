    "**Smart Power Strip with Built-in Energy Monitoring**: Design a power strip that not only distributes power to multiple devices but also monitors and displays the energy consumption of each device in real-time. This can be achieved through the integration of smart sensors and a user-friendly interface. The power strip could be connected to a smartphone app, allowing users to track their energy usage, identify energy-wasting devices, and receive personalized recommendations for energy efficiency.",
    "**Modular Power Strip with Swappable Outlets**: Create a power strip with modular outlets that can be easily swapped out or rearranged as needed. This design would cater to users who frequently need to accommodate different devices with varying plug types or who want to create a custom layout for their workspace. The modular outlets could be designed with different power ratings, allowing users to choose the right amount of power for each device.",
    "**Wireless Power Strip with Integrated Charging Pads**: Develop a power strip with built-in wireless charging pads, allowing users to charge their devices without the need for cables. The wireless charging pads could be designed to accommodate multiple devices at once, such as a phone, watch, and earbuds. This feature would be particularly useful for users who frequently use multiple devices simultaneously.",
    "**Power Strip with Integrated Surge Protection and Circuit Breaker**: Design a power strip that not only distributes power but also provides surge protection and a built-in circuit breaker. The surge protection would safeguard devices from power surges and spikes, while the circuit breaker would prevent overloads and reduce the risk of electrical fires. This feature would be especially beneficial for users who frequently use power-hungry devices or live in areas prone to power outages.",
    "**Portable Power Strip with Built-in Power Bank**: Create a portable power strip that doubles as a power bank, allowing users to charge their devices on-the-go. The power strip could be designed with a compact, foldable design and a rechargeable battery that can be charged via USB-C or a wall adapter. This feature would be particularly useful for travelers, campers, or anyone who needs to charge their devices in remote locations.
