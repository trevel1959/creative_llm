    "**Self-Cleaning Hose**: Design a garden hose with a self-cleaning mechanism that uses a built-in UV light and a retractable brush system. After each use, the hose could run a cleaning cycle that sanitizes the inner walls, removing dirt, algae, and bacteria. This would ensure that the water flowing through the hose remains clean and safe for plants and gardens.",
    "**Expandable and Flexible Hose with Built-in Storage**: Create a garden hose that can expand to different lengths based on the userâ€™s needs. When not in use, it can retract to a compact size. Additionally, incorporate a storage compartment within the hose for tools like nozzles, connectors, and fertilizers, allowing gardeners to have everything they need in one convenient location.",
    "**Multi-Functional Hose Nozzle**: Develop a nozzle that can switch between various spray patterns (e.g., mist, jet, shower, soaker) with a simple twist or button press. Include features like a timer and a flow rate control, allowing users to set specific watering durations and adjust the intensity based on plant requirements. This would make watering more efficient and customizable.",
    "**Color-Coded Temperature Indicator**: Innovate a hose that changes color based on the temperature of the water flowing through it. This feature would help gardeners avoid using excessively hot water that could damage plants or cold water that might shock them. The color-changing technology would provide a visual cue to ensure that the water temperature is ideal for various types of plants.",
    "**Eco-Friendly Hose Made from Recycled Materials**: Design a garden hose using sustainable and recycled materials, such as repurposed plastics or biodegradable composites. This eco-friendly hose would not only reduce plastic waste but could also be marketed to environmentally conscious consumers. It could include features like a built-in rainwater collection system that allows users to water their gardens with harvested rainwater."
