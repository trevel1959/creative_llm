    "**Personal Solar Panels**: Develop a line of portable, flexible solar panels that can be easily affixed to clothing or accessories. These panels would capture whatever residual sunlight is available and convert it into electricity, powering small LED lights attached to your clothing. As you move throughout the day, the lights could adjust in brightness based on the surrounding environment, ensuring you have enough light to navigate your surroundings without relying on traditional lighting sources.",
    "**Light-Reflecting Architecture**: Design buildings with innovative reflective surfaces that maximize any available light. Using advanced materials that can capture and reflect even minimal sunlight, these structures would create an illuminated interior through clever architectural design. The walls could be lined with reflective materials that scatter light throughout the space, creating an airy and bright atmosphere, ensuring that the absence of direct sunlight doesnâ€™t lead to darkness.",
    "**Holographic Light Projectors**: Create handheld devices that project holographic images of the sun and its rays. These projectors would use advanced holographic technology to create the illusion of sunlight in your home or workspace. The device could be programmed to mimic the sun's movement across the sky, casting shadows and creating a realistic atmosphere that helps combat feelings of gloom and enhances productivity.",
    "**Community Light Networks**: Establish a community initiative to create a network of shared lighting solutions. This could involve installing high-efficiency LED streetlights powered by renewable energy sources throughout neighborhoods. Residents could also collaborate to set up communal lighting zones, using solar-powered lamps in parks and gathering spaces, ensuring that the community remains vibrant and safe even in the absence of natural sunlight.",
    "**Wearable Light Devices**: Develop a line of stylish wearable devices that emit light. These could take the form of accessories like bracelets, necklaces, or even smart glasses. The devices would use advanced LED technology to provide a soft glow, adjustable based on the user's needs. They could also incorporate smart features that respond to the user's movements, ensuring that you always have enough light wherever you go."
