    "**Self-Cleaning Mechanism**: Design a washing machine with a built-in self-cleaning feature that uses UV light and steam to sanitize the drum and components. This would reduce mold and bacteria build-up, ensuring fresher laundry and minimizing maintenance for the user. The machine could run a self-clean cycle at the end of each week, alerting the user when itâ€™s complete.",
    "**Eco-Friendly Detergent Dispenser**: Create a compartment that not only dispenses detergent but also allows users to load eco-friendly pods made from biodegradable materials. This would reduce plastic waste and allow users to choose sustainable options. The machine could also track detergent levels and notify users when they are running low.",
    "**Modular Design for Upgrades**: Develop a modular washing machine design where users can easily upgrade components like the motor, drum, or control panel as technology advances. This would extend the lifespan of the appliance, reduce electronic waste, and allow users to customize their machines based on personal preferences and new features.",
    "**Interactive Touchscreen Interface**: Implement a large, interactive touchscreen that provides an intuitive user experience. The interface could include a virtual laundry guide, showing users how to sort clothes, choose the right settings, and troubleshoot issues. It could also offer a community feature where users can share tips and experiences, creating a sense of connection among users.",
    "**Integrated Drying System**: Combine washing and drying functions into one seamless system that utilizes a heat pump for energy-efficient drying. This system could automatically transfer clothes from the wash cycle to the drying cycle without user intervention. Additionally, it could offer a 'refresh' mode that uses steam to eliminate wrinkles and odors without a full drying cycle."
