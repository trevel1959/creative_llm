    "**Adjustable Spout with Multiple Settings**: Design a watering can with an adjustable spout that can switch between various spray patterns (fine mist, shower, stream) depending on the plant's needs. This feature would allow users to easily adapt their watering technique for delicate seedlings or larger, hardier plants without needing to switch tools.",
    "**Built-in Fertilizer Dispenser**: Create a watering can that has a compartment for liquid fertilizer that can be mixed with water as you pour. Users could easily add nutrients to their plants without needing to measure and mix separately, streamlining the watering process and ensuring plants receive consistent nutrition.",
    "**Ergonomic Handle with Grip Enhancements**: Revamp the handle design to be more ergonomic, featuring a cushioned grip and a pivoting mechanism that allows for easier pouring from various angles. This would reduce strain on the wrist and make it more comfortable for users to water plants, especially those with larger gardens.",
    "**Self-Watering Feature**: Innovate a watering can that can function as a self-watering device. By incorporating a reservoir that allows water to seep into the soil gradually, plants can absorb moisture as needed. This would be especially beneficial for users who travel frequently or forget to water their plants regularly.",
    "**Eco-Friendly Materials and Design**: Produce a watering can made from recycled or biodegradable materials that are also lightweight and durable. Additionally, incorporate a design that allows for easy disassembly for recycling purposes. This approach would appeal to environmentally conscious consumers and promote sustainability in gardening."
