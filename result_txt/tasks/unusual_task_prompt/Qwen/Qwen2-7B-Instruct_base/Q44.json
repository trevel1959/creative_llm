    "**DIY Bath Salts**: Use ice cube trays to create customized bath salts. Mix your favorite essential oils, sea salts, and dried flowers or herbs into water in each compartment of the tray. Freeze until solid, then pop out the individual cubes and store them in a jar. When you're ready for a relaxing bath, simply drop a few cubes into the water.",
    "**Garden Plant Starters**: Fill the compartments of an ice cube tray with soil, then carefully place a small seed on top of each cube. Gently press the seed down into the soil, cover with a thin layer of soil, and mist with water. Keep in a warm spot until the seeds sprout. Once they have grown enough roots, transfer them to pots for further growth.",
    "**Custom Ice Cubes for Drinks**: Create unique ice cubes by adding food coloring, fruit juice, or even freeze with bits of fruits, vegetables, or herbs inside. This will not only add a decorative touch to your drinks but also enhance their flavor. You can use this idea for cocktails, mocktails, or any beverage that could benefit from a special ice cube.",
    "**Crafting Jewelry**: Ice cube trays can be used as molds for DIY jewelry. Pour clear nail polish over small trinkets like beads, sequins, or small charms. Once dry, remove the items from the tray and use them as pendants or earrings. For a more sophisticated look, try using resin instead of nail polish.",
    "**Fruit Preservation**: If you want to enjoy seasonal fruits year-round, freeze them in ice cube trays. Simply wash and slice your favorite fruits, lay them flat on a plate, and once frozen, pop them into the ice cube tray. These can be used for smoothies, fruit-infused water, or as a base for homemade ice cream. This is especially helpful if you have a lot of produce that might go to waste during off-seasons."
