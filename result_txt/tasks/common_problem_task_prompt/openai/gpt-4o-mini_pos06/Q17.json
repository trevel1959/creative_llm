    "**Budget Overruns**: The financial aspect of hosting the Olympics can spiral out of control. Unexpected costs for security, construction delays, or increased operational expenses may arise. To address this, host cities should establish a contingency fund and involve financial experts in the planning process to create realistic budgets and manage expenditures efficiently.",
    "**Security Threats**: High-profile events like the Olympics attract attention from various groups, which can lead to security threats, including terrorism or protests. To counteract this, organizers should collaborate with national security agencies to develop comprehensive security plans, including advanced surveillance systems, thorough screening processes, and public awareness campaigns to encourage vigilance.",
    "**Environmental Impact**: The construction of Olympic venues and increased tourism can have detrimental effects on the environment, such as pollution and habitat destruction. Host cities should prioritize sustainability by utilizing eco-friendly materials, incorporating green spaces, and implementing waste reduction strategies. They could also offset their carbon footprint through reforestation initiatives or investing in renewable energy sources.",
    "**Athlete Welfare**: Ensuring the well-being of athletes is crucial, but challenges such as mental health issues, injuries, and inadequate facilities can arise. Organizers should provide comprehensive support systems, including access to sports psychologists, medical staff, and rehabilitation facilities. Additionally, creating an athlete-friendly environment with proper training facilities and downtime can help mitigate stress and enhance performance.",
    "**Cultural Sensitivity**: The Olympics bring together diverse cultures, and misunderstandings or insensitivity can lead to conflicts. To foster a positive atmosphere, organizers should implement cultural awareness training for staff and volunteers, promote local customs, and encourage intercultural exchanges. This approach can enhance mutual respect and understanding among participants and attendees."
