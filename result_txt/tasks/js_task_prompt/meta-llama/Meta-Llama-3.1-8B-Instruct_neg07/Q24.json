    "**Sustainable Energy Harvesting**: The city would incorporate cutting-edge renewable energy technologies, such as solar, wind, and kinetic energy harvesting. The buildings and streets would be designed to maximize energy generation, with integrated solar panels, wind turbines, and piezoelectric tiles that convert vibrations into electricity. This would reduce the city's reliance on fossil fuels and minimize its carbon footprint.",
    "**Innovative Transportation Systems**: The city would feature a futuristic public transportation system that combines electric and self-driving vehicles, as well as hyperloops and high-speed maglev trains. This would reduce congestion, pollution, and travel times, making it an efficient and eco-friendly way to get around. The city would also prioritize pedestrian-friendly and bike-friendly infrastructure, with dedicated lanes and smart traffic management systems.",
    "**Smart Water Management**: The city would implement a comprehensive water management system that collects, treats, and reuses rainwater and greywater. This would minimize wastewater and reduce the strain on the city's water supply. The system would also include advanced sensors and monitoring technology to detect leaks, predict water demand, and optimize water distribution.",
    "**Holistic Healthcare and Wellness**: The city would prioritize preventative healthcare and wellness, with a focus on community-based programs and services. This would include access to healthy food options, fitness centers, and mental health resources. The city would also incorporate green spaces and parks, which would provide a calming and restorative environment for residents.",
    "**Inclusive and Accessible Design**: The city would be designed with accessibility and inclusivity in mind, with features such as: \t* Wide, flat sidewalks and pedestrianized streets"
