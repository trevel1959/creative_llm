    "**Inflation of Bartering**: As bartering becomes the primary method of exchange, the value of goods would become more subjective. This could lead to inflation, as sellers might charge more for their goods due to the lack of a standardized value.",
    "**Shift to Alternative Currencies**: In the absence of traditional currency, people might turn to alternative forms of currency such as cryptocurrencies, which are decentralized and not tied to a physical entity. These digital currencies would have to be widely adopted to replace traditional currency.",
    "**Emergence of New Technologies**: To replace currency, new technologies might emerge. For example, a universal digital platform could be developed that allows for seamless exchange of goods and services without the need for currency.",
    "**Economic Equality**: Without currency, the wealth gap could potentially decrease. Without the ability to accumulate wealth through monetary transactions, the playing field would be more level, and wealth would be distributed more evenly.",
