    "**Themed Treasure Hunt**: Choose a fun theme like pirates, superheroes, or magical creatures. Decorate the venue with related elements and scatter clues around the area. For example, if it's a pirate-themed party, decorate with treasure maps, cannons, and pirate flags. Hide small toys or treats at the end of each clue. The children can work in teams to solve puzzles and find their way to the final treasure.",
    "**Interactive Cooking Class**: Organize a mini cooking class where the kids can learn to make simple dishes such as cupcakes, pizza rolls, or fruit skewers. Provide them with aprons and hats for a chef experience. This not only teaches them a new skill but also gives them something edible to enjoy during the party.",
    "**Crafting Station**: Set up a crafting station where the kids can make their own party favors. This could include making friendship bracelets, painting rocks, or creating masks. Provide an array of materials like beads, paints, and craft sticks so they can get creative and personalize their creations.",
    "**Music and Dance Party**: Hire a DJ or set up a playlist of kid-friendly music. Encourage the children to dance and move around. You could also organize a mini dance competition with simple moves that everyone can follow. This keeps the energy high and ensures everyone is having fun.",
    "**Storytelling Session**: Invite a professional storyteller or use a storytelling app to engage the children in a captivating tale. This can be themed to match the overall party theme. After the story, have a discussion about the characters or events to encourage their imagination and creativity. It's a great way to calm down the children and give them a moment of quiet reflection.
