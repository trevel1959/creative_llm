    "**Overheating Concerns**: When assembling a computer, there is a risk of overheating if the cooling system is inadequate. If the CPU or GPU does not have proper cooling, it can lead to thermal throttling or even hardware damage. Builders must ensure they choose appropriate cooling solutions, such as air coolers or liquid cooling systems, and consider airflow within the case to prevent overheating.",
    "**Static Electricity Damage**: During the assembly process, static electricity can pose a significant risk to sensitive components like the CPU and RAM. If a builder does not take precautions, such as using an anti-static wrist strap or working on a non-static surface, they could inadvertently damage the components, leading to malfunctions that may not be immediately evident.",
    "**Power Supply Calculations**: Another common problem is underestimating the power requirements of the build. If the power supply unit (PSU) does not provide sufficient wattage for all components, it can lead to system instability, crashes, or even hardware failure. Builders need to calculate the total wattage required and select a PSU that exceeds that number to ensure reliability.",
    "**Cable Management Issues**: Poor cable management can lead to a cluttered interior, which can hinder airflow and make future upgrades or troubleshooting difficult. Builders may face challenges in organizing cables effectively, leading to a messy build that could impact cooling efficiency and aesthetics. Planning ahead for cable routing and using cable ties can mitigate this issue.",
    "**Software Installation Hurdles**: After physically assembling the computer, the next challenge is installing the operating system and drivers. Builders may encounter issues with BIOS settings, boot order, or driver compatibility. Additionally, if the OS is not installed correctly, it can lead to system instability or failure to boot, requiring troubleshooting and potentially starting the installation process over."
