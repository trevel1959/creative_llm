    "**Glow-in-the-Dark Paint**: Another creative solution could involve using glow-in-the-dark paint to cover surfaces like walls, ceilings, or furniture. This paint would charge during the day with natural or artificial light and then emit a gentle glow at night. Artists could create stunning murals that not only serve as decoration but also provide illumination. The paint could come in various colors and patterns, allowing for personalized designs that light up the room in unique ways.",
    "**LED-Embedded Fabrics**: Imagine curtains, cushions, or even rugs made from fabrics embedded with tiny, flexible LED lights. These textiles could be designed to glow softly, creating a cozy atmosphere in the room. They could be controlled by touch or motion sensors, allowing users to adjust brightness levels. This would not only provide light but also add a touch of style and comfort to the decor.",
    "**Solar-Powered Lanterns**: Instead of relying on electrical lighting, you could use solar-powered lanterns strategically placed around the room. These lanterns would charge during the day and provide a warm glow at night. They could be designed in various stylesâ€”hanging from the ceiling, placed on tables, or even as part of a decorative arrangement. The ambiance created by these lanterns would evoke a sense of outdoor warmth and tranquility.",
    "**Candlelight Art Installations**: Create an artistic installation using candles of varying heights and sizes. These candles could be arranged in a visually appealing manner, such as in clusters or along a path. The flickering candlelight would not only illuminate the room but also create a dynamic play of shadows and light. This setup could be enhanced with mirrors or reflective surfaces to amplify the glow and add depth to the room.",
    "**Interactive Light Projectors**: Use small projectors that can display dynamic light patterns on walls and ceilings. These projectors could be programmed to create various themes, such as starry nights, flowing water, or abstract designs. Users could interact with the projectors through an app, allowing them to change the mood of the room instantly. This would not only provide light but also serve as an engaging visual experience."
