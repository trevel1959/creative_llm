This would minimize guesswork and ensure perfectly cooked meals every time.",
    "**Interactive Cooking Coach**:    Design a microwave with voice-activated technology that acts as a cooking coach. Users could ask the microwave questions like \"How do I cook this?\" or \"What's the best way to reheat pizza?\" The microwave would respond with audio instructions, making it easier for novice cooks to follow along and improve their cooking skills.",
    "**Energy Efficiency Mode**:    Introduce an energy-saving mode that optimizes cooking times and power usage based on the food type and quantity. This mode would analyze the energy consumption of the microwave and adjust its settings to use less power while still delivering excellent cooking results.
