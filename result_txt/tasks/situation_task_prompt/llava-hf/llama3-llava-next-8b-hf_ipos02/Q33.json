    "Animal Behavior: Another method would be to observe the behavior of animals, such as birds migrating or hibernating, to estimate the time of year. For example, if a bird is seen flying south, it could indicate that it is late summer or early autumn. Similarly, if a bear is seen hibernating, it could indicate that it is late winter or early spring.",
    "Plant Growth: Observing the growth of plants could also be a way to keep track of time. For example, certain plants grow faster in the spring and slower in the fall, so observing their growth patterns could provide an estimate of the season.",
    "Water Flow: If you have access to a water source, you could observe the flow of water to estimate the time of day. For example, the flow of a river or stream may be faster during the day and slower at night, providing a way to gauge the time of day.",
    "Sound Patterns: Some animals have specific sounds that they make at specific times of day. For example, certain birds may chirp more loudly in the morning and less loudly at night. Observing these sound patterns could provide a way to estimate the time of day.",
    "Human Cycles: Finally, you could observe the natural cycles of human behavior to estimate the time of day. For example, most people tend to be more active during the day and more sedentary at night. Observing the movement of people in a public space could provide an estimate of the time of day."
