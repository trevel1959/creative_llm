    "Adaptability to Extreme Environments: The new plant species would be designed to thrive in extreme environments such as deserts, polar regions, or even underwater. It would have specialized adaptations that allow it to survive in harsh conditions, such as drought-resistant leaves, cold-tolerant roots, and salt-tolerance.",
    "Medicinal Properties: The new plant species would have medicinal properties that could be used to treat various diseases and illnesses. Its leaves, flowers, and roots could contain compounds that have anti-inflammatory, antiviral, or antibacterial properties. This could make it a valuable resource for developing new drugs and treatments.",
    "Self-Replicating: The new plant species would be able to self-replicate, meaning that it could reproduce without the need for pollination or fertilization. This would make it easier to propagate and cultivate, making it more accessible to people around the world.",
    "Edible Fruits: The new plant species would produce edible fruits that are both nutritious and delicious. These fruits could be harvested and consumed raw, or they could be processed into various food products such as juices, jams, and desserts.",
    "Air Purifying: The new plant species would have air-purifying abilities that could help improve indoor air quality. Its leaves and stems would absorb pollutants and toxins from the air, releasing clean oxygen back into the environment. This could be particularly useful in urban areas where air pollution is a major concern."
