    "**Vertical Living**: This idea involves maximizing space by incorporating vertical elements in the design of your tiny house. Think about using multi-level sleeping areas (such as loft beds), wall-mounted shelves for storage, and vertical garden walls for fresh produce or greenery. The vertical garden could also be a living wall that filters air and adds aesthetic appeal. The key to this design is careful planning to ensure everything is easily accessible and functional.",
    "**Rolling Kitchen**: Design a kitchen with rolling components that can be easily moved around the house. For instance, a rolling island can serve as a workspace when needed and then be tucked away in a corner or garage area when not in use. This approach not only maximizes space but also allows for flexibility in how the space is used throughout the day.",
    "**Solar-Powered and Eco-Friendly**: Incorporate sustainable features such as solar panels, rainwater harvesting systems, and energy-efficient appliances. This design choice not only reduces environmental impact but also cuts down on utility costs. The solar panels can be integrated into the roof or fa√ßade, while rainwater collection systems can provide water for washing, flushing toilets, and other non-potable uses.",
    "**Convertible Furniture**: Use furniture that can serve multiple purposes. For example, a sofa bed that converts into a desk with a pull-out keyboard tray, or a coffee table that opens up to reveal storage space for bedding or other items. This concept saves space and ensures that every part of the tiny house is utilized efficiently.",
    "**Custom Modular Design**: Create a modular design where different sections of the house can be added or removed based on the user's needs. This might include a detachable bedroom module, an expandable kitchen, or even a separate outdoor living space that can be attached seasonally. Each module would be designed to be lightweight, easy to transport, and structurally sound, ensuring adaptability and convenience."
