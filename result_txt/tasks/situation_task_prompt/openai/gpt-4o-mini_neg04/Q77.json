    "**Floating Parks**: Imagine parks that float on water bodies like lakes, rivers, or even coastal areas. These floating parks could include various levels of platforms, connected by bridges and walkways. Each platform could host different activities like yoga classes, picnics, and community gardens. People could paddle or sail to these parks, providing a unique outdoor experience that embraces water as a natural element, promoting both recreation and relaxation.",
    "**Sky Gardens and Vertical Forests**: With mountains gone, cities could develop vertical forests and sky gardens on high-rise buildings. These green spaces would serve as urban oases, where residents and visitors can enjoy nature while being surrounded by the city. Activities could include guided nature walks, outdoor fitness classes, and community gardening events. These spaces would not only promote outdoor activities but also improve air quality and biodiversity in urban areas.",
    "**Adventure Parks with Artificial Features**: Without natural mountains, adventure parks could create artificial climbing walls, zip lines, and obstacle courses that mimic mountain terrains. These parks could offer various difficulty levels and cater to all ages, making them a family-friendly destination. Events like climbing competitions, obstacle races, and team-building exercises could encourage people to engage in physical activities while enjoying the thrill of adventure.",
    "**Nature Immersion Experiences**: Organizing immersive nature experiences in existing forests, wetlands, or coastal areas could become popular. These experiences could include guided foraging tours, wildlife tracking, or even mindfulness retreats that focus on connecting with nature. Participants could engage in activities like birdwatching, photography, or painting outdoors, allowing them to appreciate the beauty of the natural world in a serene setting.",
    "**Community Outdoor Festivals**: Communities could host outdoor festivals that celebrate nature, art, and culture. These festivals could feature local artisans, food vendors, live music, and workshops that promote outdoor skills like cooking with fire, crafting with natural materials, or gardening. Activities could include scavenger hunts, nature walks, and interactive art installations, fostering a sense of community and encouraging people to spend time outdoors."
