    "\"Satellite-Sail\": A revolutionary new approach to space travel that utilizes a satellite as a sail, harnessing the power of solar winds to propel it into space. The satellite would be designed with a large, thin, lightweight membrane that would act as a sail, using the pressure of the solar winds to propel the satellite forward. This innovative design would reduce the need for expensive and heavy propellant, making space travel more accessible and cost-effective.",
    "\"Satellite-Drone\": A satellite that doubles as a drone, capable of deploying smaller drones from its body to conduct surveillance, maintenance, or other tasks in space. The satellite would be equipped with a modular design, allowing it to accommodate different types of drones for various missions. This would enable more efficient and flexible use of resources, as well as provide real-time updates and data from space.",
    "\"Satellite-Power Plant\": A satellite that harnesses the power of the sun to generate electricity, using advanced solar panels to convert sunlight into energy. This innovative design would provide a sustainable and reliable source of power for space missions, eliminating the need for expensive and heavy batteries or other power sources. The excess energy could even be transmitted back to Earth, providing a new source of renewable energy.",
    "\"Satellite-Refueling Station\": A satellite that serves as a refueling station for other spacecraft, using advanced technology to transfer fuel and other resources from the satellite to the visiting spacecraft. This would greatly extend the range and duration of space missions, allowing spacecraft to travel further and stay in space for longer periods of time without the need for frequent refueling.",
    "\"Satellite-Hotel\": A satellite that provides temporary accommodations and facilities for space travelers, offering a comfortable and convenient place to stay during long-duration space missions. The satellite would be equipped with living quarters, laboratories, and other amenities, as well as advanced life support systems to sustain the health and well-being of its occupants. This innovative design would enable space agencies and private space companies to provide a more comfortable and sustainable experience for their personnel, while also reducing the costs and risks associated with space travel."
