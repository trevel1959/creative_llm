    "Encouraging Indigenous Plants: Introducing plants that are naturally native to the area and known to be effective in repelling pests can help minimize their infestations. These plants can create a natural barrier against pests while providing a habitat for local birds and other pest predators.",
    "Developing and implementing a Integrated Pest Management (IPM) approach: IPM is a holistic approach to managing pests, which involves combining cultural, biological and chemical methods. This approach can provide a more sustainable solution to pest management, reducing reliance on chemicals and minimizing the risk of pesticide resistance.",
    "Educating the Public: Educating the public about the importance of pest control and what they can do to prevent pest infestations can help reduce the overall pest population. This could include practices like proper waste disposal, maintaining sanitary living conditions, and identifying and addressing sources of food for pests.",
    "Developing New Technologies: Research into new technologies, such as drones, robotics, and artificial intelligence, could help improve pest management techniques and reduce their impact on the environment.",
    "Rearing Predator Species: Introducing predator species to help control pests can be an effective and environmentally friendly method of pest management. This could include reintroducing species that were previously present in the area, and breeding programs to ensure a sustainable population."
