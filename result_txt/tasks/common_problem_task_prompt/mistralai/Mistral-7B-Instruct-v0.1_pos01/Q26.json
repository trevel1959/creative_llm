    "\"One idea could be to design a robot that can assist climbers in reaching the summit of Mount Everest. The robot could be equipped with a variety of tools and sensors to help climbers navigate the treacherous terrain, such as ice picks, crampons, and GPS technology. It could also have a communication system to keep climbers connected with base camp and emergency services. Confidence score: 0.8\"",
    "\"Another idea could be to develop a virtual reality training program for climbers to prepare for the challenges of climbing Mount Everest. The program could simulate different scenarios, such as avalanches, icefalls, and extreme weather conditions, allowing climbers to practice their skills and prepare mentally for the climb. Confidence score: 0.6\"",
    "\"A third idea could be to design a drone that can carry supplies and equipment to climbers on Mount Everest, reducing the amount of weight they need to carry and making the climb more manageable. The drone could be equipped with a variety of sensors to help it navigate the terrain and avoid obstacles. Confidence score: 0.7\"",
    "\"A fourth idea could be to develop a system of solar-powered charging stations along the route to Mount Everest, providing climbers with a reliable source of electricity to power their devices and recharge their batteries. This would help to reduce the environmental impact of the climb and make the expedition more sustainable. Confidence score: 0.6\"",
    "\"A fifth idea could be to design a system of wireless communication devices that can be used by climbers to communicate with each other and with base camp. These devices could be equipped with GPS technology to help climbers locate each other in case of emergency and could also be used to monitor the weather and other conditions on the mountain.
