    "**Radiation Exposure**: Mars is exposed to higher levels of radiation due to its location near the sun and the absence of a magnetic field like Earth's. This radiation can cause severe health problems, including cancer and damage to the nervous system.",
    "**Lack of Water**: Water is essential for life, and there is very little liquid water on Mars. This would make it difficult for humans to drink, cook, or engage in activities that require water, such as agriculture or cleaning.",
    "**Temperature Extremes**: Mars has extreme temperature variations, with temperatures reaching up to 70 degrees Celsius during the day and dropping to -100 degrees Celsius at night. This would make it challenging to maintain comfortable living conditions.",
    "**Gravity and Muscle Atrophy**: Mars has only about 38% of Earth's gravity, which could lead to muscle atrophy and other health issues over time. This would require humans to adapt to the lower gravity or find ways to counteract its effects.",
    "**Lack of Nutrients**: The Martian soil is not very fertile, which would make it difficult to grow crops and obtain necessary nutrients. This would require humans to either import food or find ways to grow crops in the Martian environment."
