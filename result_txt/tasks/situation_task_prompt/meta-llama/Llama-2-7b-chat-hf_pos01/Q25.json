    "Build a makeshift elevator: I would gather materials like ropes, pulleys, and wooden planks to construct a makeshift elevator. I would attach the pulleys to the top of the skyscraper and the ropes to the bottom, creating a system that would allow people to climb up and down the building. I would also install safety measures like harnesses and carabiners to prevent accidents. Confidence score: 0.8",
    "Use a zip line: I would set up a zip line from the ground floor to the top of the skyscraper. This would allow people to slide down the building, reaching the top in a matter of seconds. I would make sure to install safety brakes and harnesses to prevent accidents. Confidence score: 0.9",
    "Create a rope climbing route: I would map out a route for climbers to follow, using the sides of the skyscraper as a climbing wall. I would place bolts and anchors at regular intervals to secure the ropes and prevent falls. Climbers would need to be experienced and equipped with proper gear to attempt this route. Confidence score: 0.7",
    "Use a balloon to reach the top: I would inflate a large balloon and tie it to a rope, attaching the other end to a harness. I would then climb into the balloon and ascend to the top of the skyscraper, using the wind to lift me up. This method would be risky and require careful planning, but it could be a unique and exciting way to reach the top. Confidence score: 0.6",
    "Create a human pulley system: I would gather a group of people and assign them specific roles in the pulley system. One person would climb to the top of the skyscraper and attach a rope to the highest point. The rest of the group would then pull on the rope, creating a pulley system that would lift the person at the bottom of the building to the top. This method would require coordination and teamwork, but it could be an effective way to reach the top. Confidence score: 0.8"
