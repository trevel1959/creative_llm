    "Smart Bell: Integrate a smart sensor into the bell that can detect the rider's proximity to other cyclists, pedestrians, or vehicles. When the sensor detects a potential collision, the bell can alert the rider with a warning sound or vibration, giving them time to react and avoid an accident.",
    "Customizable Design: Offer interchangeable bell covers in different colors, designs, or patterns. This would allow riders to personalize their bike's bell to match their style and personality.",
    "LED Lighting: Incorporate LED lights into the bell to provide visibility for the rider, especially when cycling in low-light conditions. The lights could also be programmed to flash in different patterns to indicate the rider's mood or to signal to other road users.",
    "Safety Features: Add a built-in airbag or a shock-absorbing mechanism to the bell, which would protect the rider's head or handlebars in case of a collision. This would provide an extra layer of safety and peace of mind for riders.",
    "Integration with Smartphones: Develop a bell that can connect to a rider's smartphone via Bluetooth or Wi-Fi. This would allow the rider to receive notifications, such as calls, texts, or emails, through the bell's speaker, keeping their hands free to focus on the road."
