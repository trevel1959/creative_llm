    "**Vertical Farms in Urban Centers**: As coastal areas become uninhabitable, urban centers could transform into vertical farming hubs. Skyscrapers would be converted into multi-level farms, utilizing hydroponics and aeroponics to grow food efficiently. This concept would not only provide food security for urban populations but also create green spaces that improve air quality and reduce heat islands. The buildings would be equipped with rainwater harvesting systems and renewable energy sources, making them self-sufficient.",
    "**Inland Retreats**: With rising ocean levels, moving inland could become a popular choice. Imagine creating a network of eco-friendly retreats in mountainous or elevated regions, designed for both living and tourism. These retreats would feature tiny homes, communal kitchens, and shared gardens, promoting a lifestyle focused on sustainability and community. The design would emphasize natural materials and incorporate local wildlife habitats, creating a harmonious balance between human living and nature.",
    "**Reclaimed Island Communities**: As ocean levels rise, some islands may become submerged, prompting innovative reclamation projects. Communities could be established on the remnants of these islands, using sustainable building practices to create floating platforms or elevated structures. These reclaimed communities would focus on preserving local culture and traditions while incorporating modern technology for energy and water management. Residents would engage in marine conservation efforts to restore and protect the surrounding ecosystems.",
    "**Nomadic Living Pods**: Picture a lifestyle that embraces mobility in response to changing landscapes. Nomadic living pods could be designed as mobile homes equipped with solar panels, water filtration systems, and space for growing food. These pods would allow individuals and families to relocate as needed, following the shifting geography caused by rising ocean levels. Communities of pod dwellers could form temporary settlements, sharing resources and knowledge, and fostering a sense of camaraderie despite the transient nature of their living arrangements.",
    "**Highland Communes**: As coastal regions become less viable, highland areas could develop into thriving communes focused on sustainable living. These communes would feature eco-friendly homes, communal gardens, and workshops for skills sharing. The emphasis would be on self-sufficiency, with members growing their own food, producing renewable energy, and engaging in cooperative trade. The design would prioritize communal spaces for gatherings and activities, fostering a strong sense of belonging and shared purpose."
