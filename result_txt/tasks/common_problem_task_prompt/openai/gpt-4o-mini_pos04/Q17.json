    "**Environmental Impact**: The construction of new venues and the increase in tourism can lead to environmental degradation. This includes issues like increased waste, pollution, and disruption to local ecosystems. To address this, organizers could implement strict sustainability measures, such as using green building practices for new venues, promoting public transportation, and ensuring that waste management systems are robust and efficient.",
    "**Security Concerns**: Large-scale events like the Olympics can attract not only sports fans but also potential threats, including terrorism or protests. Ensuring the safety of participants and spectators is paramount. This could lead to heavy security measures that might infringe on civil liberties or create a hostile atmosphere. To combat this, organizers could focus on community engagement and transparent communication about security protocols to foster trust and cooperation among the public.",
    "**Economic Disparities**: While hosting the Olympics can bring in tourism and boost the local economy, it can also exacerbate economic disparities. The focus on high-profile events might lead to neglect of local communities, who may not benefit from the influx of cash. To counter this, a portion of the revenue generated could be allocated to community development projects, ensuring that the benefits of the Olympics reach all segments of the population.",
    "**Cultural Sensitivity**: The Olympics is a global event, and cultural misunderstandings can arise between visitors and local residents. This can lead to tensions or negative portrayals of the host city. To prevent this, organizers could implement cultural exchange programs or initiatives that educate both visitors and locals about each other's customs and traditions, fostering mutual respect and understanding.",
    "**Athlete Welfare**: The pressure to perform at the Olympics can lead to mental health issues among athletes, exacerbated by the intense competition and public scrutiny. Additionally, there could be concerns regarding the health and safety of athletes due to inadequate medical facilities or support systems. To address this, the Olympic Committee could ensure that comprehensive mental health resources are available for athletes, including counseling and wellness programs, and that medical facilities are well-equipped and staffed."
