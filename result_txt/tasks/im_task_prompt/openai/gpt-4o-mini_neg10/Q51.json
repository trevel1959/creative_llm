    "**Modular Table Design**: Create a modular table that can be easily reconfigured for different purposes. Each section of the table could be a separate piece that can be rearranged, added, or removed depending on the need—whether it’s for dining, working, or crafting. This would encourage creativity in how spaces are used and help adapt to various activities, making the table a versatile centerpiece.",
    "**Integrated Charging Stations**: Incorporate wireless charging pads and USB ports directly into the table’s surface. This would allow users to charge their devices conveniently while working or dining without the clutter of cords. Additionally, the table could have a built-in battery pack that stores energy for outdoor use, making it perfect for picnics or camping.",
    "**Augmented Reality (AR) Table**: Design a table that uses AR technology to project images or information onto its surface. Users could place their devices on the table, and the AR system could enhance the experience by providing interactive elements related to food, games, or presentations. For instance, during dinner, the table could display nutritional information about the meal or provide fun facts about the ingredients.",
    "**Mood Lighting and Sound Integration**: Equip the table with customizable LED mood lighting and integrated speakers. Users could change the lighting color and intensity based on the time of day or the atmosphere they want to create. The sound system could play background music or nature sounds, enhancing the dining or working experience and making it more immersive and enjoyable.",
    "**Eco-Friendly Materials with Plant Integration**: Develop a table made from sustainable materials that includes built-in planters. Users could grow herbs or small plants right in the table, promoting a connection to nature. This not only beautifies the space but also provides fresh ingredients for cooking. The design could incorporate self-watering systems to make plant care easy and accessible."
