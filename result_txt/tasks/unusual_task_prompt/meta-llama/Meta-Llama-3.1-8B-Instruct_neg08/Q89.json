    "\"Task-Triggered Envy\" - A Mobile App: Develop a mobile app that tracks users' progress on tasks and allows them to share their accomplishments on social media. The twist? The app also detects when a user expresses envy towards others' achievements, and offers a \"task trigger\" feature. This feature generates a new task for the user, tailored to their skills and interests, to help them redirect their envy into productivity. The app could also include a \"buddy system\" where users can join groups based on similar interests and work together to complete tasks, fostering a sense of community and reducing feelings of jealousy.",
    "\"Envy-Erasing Escape Room\": Create an immersive escape room experience where players are trapped in a room filled with tasks and puzzles. The catch?

The show could include special challenges, such as \"envy hijacks\" where contestants are tempted to sabotage each other's progress, and \"empathy boosts\" where contestants earn rewards for showing kindness and understanding towards their opponents.",
    "\"Envy-Erasing Art Therapy\": Create a series of art therapy sessions where participants explore the emotions and motivations behind their envy. Through guided exercises and creative expression, participants learn to identify and challenge negative thought patterns, and develop a growth mindset. The art therapy sessions could culminate in a collaborative mural or sculpture that represents the collective journey towards overcoming envy.",
    "\"The Envy-Eliminator Podcast\": Launch a podcast that delves into the psychology and neuroscience behind envy, featuring expert interviews and personal stories of overcoming jealousy.
