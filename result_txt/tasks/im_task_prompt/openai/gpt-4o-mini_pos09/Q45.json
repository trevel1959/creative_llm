    "**Mood Lighting Features**:    Incorporate adjustable LED lights into the fan blades or the central hub that can change color and intensity based on the time of day or user preferences. This would allow the fan to serve a dual purpose as both a cooling device and an ambient light source, creating a cozy atmosphere for different activities such as reading, entertaining, or relaxing.",
    "**Air Quality Monitoring**:    Integrate an air quality sensor into the ceiling fan that can monitor pollutants, humidity, and temperature. When the air quality drops below a certain threshold, the fan could automatically increase its speed to circulate air or notify users through a connected app. This feature would promote a healthier indoor environment and encourage timely ventilation.",
    "**Self-Cleaning Mechanism**:    Design the ceiling fan with a self-cleaning feature that utilizes a combination of UV-C light and gentle air blasts to eliminate dust and allergens from the blades. This would not only improve the fan's efficiency by maintaining optimal airflow but also reduce the need for regular manual cleaning, making it more convenient for users.",
    "**Customizable Blade Designs**:    Offer interchangeable fan blades with various designs, materials, and colors that can be easily swapped out to match seasonal decor or personal style. Users could purchase themed blades for holidays or special occasions, allowing the fan to become a decorative element in addition to its functional purpose.",
    "**Wind Chill Effect Simulation**:    Develop a fan with advanced blade technology that can create a wind chill effect, simulating a more pronounced cooling sensation without significantly lowering the room temperature. This could be achieved by adjusting the angle and speed of the blades dynamically based on the temperature readings, providing a more comfortable experience during hot weather."
