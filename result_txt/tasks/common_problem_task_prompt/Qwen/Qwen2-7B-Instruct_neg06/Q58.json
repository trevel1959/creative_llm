    "**Phishing Resistant Email System**: Develop an email system that uses advanced AI algorithms to analyze emails in real-time for phishing attempts. This system would not only flag suspicious emails but also learn from past attacks to improve its detection rate. It could include features like behavioral analysis, where the system learns the typical behavior patterns of users within the company and flags any deviations as potential threats.",
    "**Blockchain-Enhanced Data Integrity Solution**: Implement a blockchain-based system to ensure the integrity and confidentiality of data within the company's network. This solution would involve creating a decentralized database that records all transactions or data changes. By using blockchain technology, the system would provide an immutable ledger, making it extremely difficult for unauthorized access or data tampering.",
    "**AI-Powered Incident Response Framework**: Create an automated incident response framework that leverages machine learning algorithms to quickly identify and respond to cyber threats. The system would be designed to monitor the network continuously for unusual activities, such as unauthorized access attempts, malware infections, or unusual data movement patterns. Upon detecting a threat, the framework would initiate an automated response, containing the breach while minimizing disruption to business operations.",
    "**Zero Trust Network Architecture**: Design a Zero Trust Network Architecture (ZTNA) for the company, which assumes that network perimeters are no longer secure and that all users and devices must be authenticated and authorized before accessing resources. This approach involves implementing strict access controls based on user identity, device health, and context-aware policies. By doing so, the system significantly reduces the risk of internal breaches and unauthorized access.",
    "**Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) Enhancement**: Enhance the existing MFA system by integrating additional authentication factors and technologies. This could include biometric verification, behavioral biometrics, and device fingerprinting. By combining multiple layers of authentication, the system would provide a more robust defense against unauthorized access, ensuring that even if one factor is compromised, access to sensitive information remains protected."
