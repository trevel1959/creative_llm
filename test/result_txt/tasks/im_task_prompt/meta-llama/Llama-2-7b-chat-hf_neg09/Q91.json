    "Augmented Reality Luggage Tag: Develop an interactive luggage tag that uses augmented reality (AR) technology to provide travelers with information about their destination. Using a mobile app, travelers could scan the tag with their smartphone, and the AR display would show them information such as the nearest attractions, best restaurants, and transportation options.",

This would make the luggage tag a unique and memorable souvenir of their trip, and travelers could even share their designs with friends and family.",
    "Solar-Powered Luggage Tag: Design a luggage tag that harnesses the power of solar energy to keep track of travelers' luggage.
