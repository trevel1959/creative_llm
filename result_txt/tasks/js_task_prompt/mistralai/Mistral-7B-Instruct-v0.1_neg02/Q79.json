    "\"The Skyway\" - A levitating train system that uses magnetic levitation technology to transport passengers through the air. The train would be powered by a renewable energy source and could travel at high speeds, making it an efficient and eco-friendly form of transportation.",
    "\"The Hyperloop\" - A high-speed transportation system that uses vacuum-sealed tubes to transport passengers through a series of tubes. The Hyperloop would be powered by electricity and could travel at speeds of up to 700 miles per hour, making it one of the fastest forms of transportation in the world.",
    "\"The Waterway\" - A transportation system that uses boats and ships to transport passengers through rivers and oceans. The Waterway would be powered by renewable energy sources such as wind and solar power and could be used for both short and long-distance travel.",
    "\"The Skywalk\" - A network of elevated walkways that connect different parts of a city or town. The Skywalk would be made of durable materials such as steel and concrete and could be used by pedestrians and cyclists to get around.",
    "\"The Podway\" - A transportation system that uses small, self-driving pods to transport passengers through underground tunnels. The Podway would be powered by electricity and could be used for both short and long-distance travel, making it a convenient and efficient form of transportation."
