    "Create a Writing System Using Light: In a world without pens or pencils, a new writing system could be developed that uses light. This could involve using a special pen or device that emits light, or even using the user's own body to create the writing. For example, a person could use their finger to create a beam of light that spells out words, or they could use a small mirror to reflect light onto a surface to create written messages.",
    "Use a Sonic Writing Device: In a world without pens or pencils, a sonic writing device could be developed. This device would use sound waves to create written messages.

This method would allow for fast and efficient writing, and it could be used in a variety of settings, such as in meetings or on the go."
