    "**Fire Pit Cooking**: Create a fire pit using stones or a metal container. Gather dry wood and kindling to start a fire. Once the fire is established, use sticks to skewer meat and vegetables, roasting them over the open flames. Alternatively, wrap food in large leaves (like banana leaves) and place them in the embers for a smoky flavor. This method connects with ancient cooking traditions and provides a communal cooking experience.",
    "**Steam Cooking with Natural Materials**: Construct a makeshift steamer using large leaves and stones. Fill a large container with water and bring it to a boil over a fire. Place food wrapped in leaves above the boiling water, using stones to create a makeshift platform. The steam will cook the food gently, preserving nutrients and flavors. This technique can be applied to grains, fish, or vegetables.",
    "**Clay Pot Cooking**: If clay is available, shape it into pots and bowls. After drying and firing the clay in a fire pit, use these pots to cook food. Fill the pot with ingredients and place it in the embers of the fire. The heat will slowly cook the food, infusing it with a rich, earthy flavor. This method encourages creativity in pottery and allows for various cooking styles, such as stewing or baking.",
    "**Cold Preparation with Fermentation**: Embrace the art of fermentation and prepare meals without heat. Create fermented dishes like kimchi or pickles using vegetables, salt, and water. This method not only preserves food but also enhances flavors and introduces beneficial probiotics. Pair fermented vegetables with raw grains soaked in water or vegetable broth for a nutritious meal.",
    "**Natural Grilling with Rocks**: Find flat, smooth stones and heat them in a fire. Once hot, place food directly on the stones to grill. This method allows for even cooking and can be used for a variety of foods, including fish, meats, and vegetables. The stones retain heat and provide a unique cooking surface that adds a distinct flavor to the food."
