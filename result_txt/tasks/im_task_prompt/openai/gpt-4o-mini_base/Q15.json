    "**Modular Backpack System**: Instead of a single, monolithic design, this backpack could be modular, allowing users to attach or detach various compartments based on their needs. For instance, a user could add a camera compartment for photography trips, a cooler compartment for picnics, or even a gym compartment with shoe storage. This flexibility would cater to a variety of lifestyles and activities.",
    "**Built-in GPS and Tracking Features**: To prevent loss or theft, this backpack could come equipped with GPS tracking that syncs with a smartphone app. If the backpack is misplaced or stolen, the user could track its location in real-time. Additionally, the app could include a \"find my backpack\" feature that alerts the user if they move a certain distance away from it.",
    "**Ergonomic Design with Adjustable Support**: This backpack could feature an adjustable back support system that conforms to the userâ€™s spine and posture. It would include customizable lumbar support and adjustable straps that distribute weight evenly across the body, significantly reducing strain during long periods of wear. Built-in air channels could enhance ventilation to keep the user comfortable.",
    "**Interactive Interior Organization**: The interior of the backpack could feature a smart organization system that uses RFID tags and a companion app to help users keep track of their belongings. When items are placed inside, the app could log their location, and users could search for items through the app, which would indicate where they are stored within the bag.",
    "**Weather-Resistant and Self-Cleaning Fabric**: Utilizing advanced nanotechnology, the backpack could be made from a weather-resistant fabric that repels water and dirt. Additionally, the material could have self-cleaning properties, using photocatalytic coatings that break down organic stains when exposed to sunlight, keeping the backpack looking fresh and clean with minimal effort."
