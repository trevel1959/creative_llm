    "**Atmospheric Water Harvesting via Fog Collection**:    - Implement a network of fog collectors, such as mesh-like structures or mesh-covered pipes, that capture water droplets from fog. These structures would be placed in areas where fog is prevalent, such as coastal regions or high-altitude areas.",
    "**Solar Still Water Collection**:    - Design a solar still, a device that uses the sun's heat to evaporate water from a surface, which is then collected as condensation on a cooler surface.",
    "**Condensation-Based Water Collection from Air**:    - Develop a system that utilizes a heat exchanger to cool the air, causing water vapor to condense into liquid water.",
    "**Rainwater Harvesting via Vertical Gardens**:    - Design a vertical garden system that not only provides a green space for urban areas but also collects rainwater.",
    "**Desalination via Humidity-Based Distillation**:    - Develop a system that uses the humidity in the air to distill water from seawater or brackish water."
