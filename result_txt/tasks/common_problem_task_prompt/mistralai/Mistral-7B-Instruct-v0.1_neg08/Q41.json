While it's understandable to feel jealous when others seem to have finished their tasks, it's important to remember that everyone has their own unique skills and resources. Perhaps you could try reaching out to some of the experts in the field and learning from them, or even taking a course or workshop on spaceship design. This way, you can develop your own skills and knowledge and work towards creating your own spaceship.\"",
    "\"It's possible that the way others finished their tasks seems so effortless to you because they may have had more time or resources than you did. Instead of focusing on jealousy, try to focus on what you can do with the time and resources you have.
