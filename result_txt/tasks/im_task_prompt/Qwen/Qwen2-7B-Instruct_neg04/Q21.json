    "**Smart Door Locks with Facial Recognition**: Design a door lock system that uses facial recognition technology to grant access to authorized individuals. The system can be integrated into existing smart home systems for seamless operation. It could also include features like automatic unlocking when the owner approaches the door, and notifications on the user's smartphone if someone unrecognized attempts entry.",
    "**Energy-Efficient Smart Doors**: Create a door that utilizes smart sensors and actuators to adjust its insulation based on the outside temperature and internal heat level. This door could potentially save energy by maintaining optimal temperature inside homes or buildings while also reducing the load on heating and cooling systems.",
    "**Interactive Artistic Doors**: Design doors that are interactive pieces of art, possibly incorporating LED lighting, kinetic elements, or even holographic projections. For example, a door could change color patterns or display images in response to ambient light changes or specific events (like the time of day, weather conditions, or even personal preferences).",
    "**Sustainable Door Panels**: Develop a door made from sustainable materials such as recycled plastic, reclaimed wood, or bamboo, which can be customized with various textures and designs. The door could also integrate solar panels or other renewable energy sources, charging devices when someone opens the door or using the energy generated for other purposes within the building.",
    "**Emergency Evacuation Door Systems**: Design a door system specifically for emergency use in high-risk areas like hospitals, schools, or commercial buildings. This system would feature quick-opening mechanisms, automatic door controls, and clear emergency instructions displayed on the door. Additionally, it could include audio-visual alarms and integration with security systems to alert first responders during evacuations. "
