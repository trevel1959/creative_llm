    "**The Treaty of Versailles (1919)**: I would alter the terms of the treaty to prevent the harsh penalties imposed on Germany, which led to widespread resentment and ultimately, the rise of Nazi Germany. By reducing the reparations and limitations on German military, I believe the treaty would have promoted a more stable and cooperative Europe, potentially preventing World War II.",
    "**The American Revolution (1775-1783)**: I would ensure that the Continental Army, led by George Washington, had access to more resources and support from European powers, particularly France. This would have likely led to a quicker and more decisive victory over the British, potentially altering the course of American history and the fate of Native American tribes.",
    "**The Great Fire of London (1666)**: I would have the firebreaks and firefighting efforts in place earlier, allowing the fire to be contained and extinguished before it spread across the city. This would have saved countless lives, homes, and businesses, and potentially altered the course of London's development and architecture.",
    "**The discovery of the New World (1492)**: I would have Christopher Columbus and other European explorers adopt a more respectful and collaborative approach with indigenous populations, avoiding the devastating impact of colonization and disease that decimated native populations. This could have led to a more peaceful and mutually beneficial exchange of cultures and ideas.",
    "**The Chernobyl Nuclear Disaster (1986)**: I would have the safety tests and maintenance procedures been performed more thoroughly, or have the plant's design been improved to prevent the catastrophic accident. This would have prevented the worst nuclear disaster in history, saving countless lives and preventing the long-term environmental damage."
