    "**Foldable and Collapsible Design**: Create a laundry basket that can be easily folded down when not in use. This would save space in smaller homes or apartments. The design could include a locking mechanism to ensure stability when itâ€™s in use and can be made from lightweight, durable materials for easy transport.",
    "**Integrated Sorting Compartments**: Design a laundry basket with built-in compartments for sorting clothes by color, fabric type, or washing instructions. Each compartment could have a removable liner for easy cleaning, and the basket could include labels or color-coded sections to help users quickly identify where to place their items.",
    "**Odor-Eliminating Technology**: Incorporate odor-eliminating technology, such as activated charcoal or a UV-C light, into the laundry basket. This feature would help neutralize odors from dirty clothes, making it more pleasant to store laundry before washing. It could also include a timer that activates the odor-elimination process at specific intervals.",
    "**Laundry Basket with Built-in Hamper and Dryer**: Innovate a multi-functional laundry basket that includes a detachable hamper for collecting dirty clothes and a compact dryer that uses a gentle, low-heat drying method. This would allow users to wash and dry small loads of laundry without needing a full-size washing machine or dryer, making it ideal for apartments or dorms.",
    "**Eco-Friendly Materials and Design**: Focus on sustainability by using recycled materials to construct the laundry basket. Additionally, the design could incorporate features that encourage eco-friendly practices, such as a compartment for storing reusable dryer balls or a small pocket for eco-friendly detergent pods, promoting environmentally conscious laundry habits."
