    "A Smart Clothes Hanger: Create a clothes hanger with sensors that detect when an item of clothing is placed on or removed from the hanger. The sensors can be connected to a mobile app or a smart home system, which can automatically organize the clothes in the closet based on the type of garment, color, or frequency of use. This can help you easily find what you're looking for and reduce clutter in your closet.",
    "A Hanging Organizer: Design a clothes hanger with multiple hooks or bars that can hold different types of garments, such as dresses, shirts, pants, and skirts. The hanger can also have pockets or compartments to store small items like accessories, jewelry, or belts. This can help you keep your closet organized and make it easier to find what you need.",
    "A Customizable Clothes Hanger: Create a clothes hanger that can be customized to fit different sizes and shapes of garments. The hanger can have adjustable hooks or bars that can be moved up or down to accommodate different sizes, or it can have a collapsible design that can be adjusted to fit different types of garments. This can help you make the most of your closet space and keep your clothes organized.",
    "A No-Slip Clothes Hanger: Design a clothes hanger with a non-slip surface that prevents garments from falling off the hanger. This can be especially useful for delicate or heavy items that you don't want to damage or lose. The non-slip surface can be made of a textured material like rubber or silicone, or it can be coated with a non-slip finish.",
    "A Hanging Closet Organizer: Create a clothes hanger that doubles as a closet organizer. The hanger can have pockets or compartments to store different types of garments, as well as hooks or bars for hanging belts, scarves, or other accessories. The hanger can also have a built-in light or a USB port for charging your devices while you get dressed. This can help you keep your closet organized and make it more functional."
