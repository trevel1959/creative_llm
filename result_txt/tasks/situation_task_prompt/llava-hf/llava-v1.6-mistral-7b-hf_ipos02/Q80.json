    "**Blockchain-based Payment Systems**: Blockchain technology, which underlies cryptocurrencies, could be expanded to create a universal, decentralized payment system. This would allow for instant, secure, and transparent transactions without the need for intermediaries like banks or credit card companies.",
    "**Smart Contracts**: Smart contracts, which are self-executing contracts with the terms of the agreement directly written into code, could be used to automate payments. For example, a smart contract could be set up to release payment to a seller once the buyer receives the product or service.",
    "**Credit Scoring Systems**: In a cashless society, credit scoring systems would become even more important. People would be assessed based on their creditworthiness, and their scores would determine their ability to borrow money or obtain loans. This could lead to a more efficient lending system, as lenders would have access to a wealth of data about potential borrowers.",
    "**Subscription-based Services**: With the disappearance of cash, subscription-based services could become more popular. People could pay a monthly fee to access a variety of goods and services, similar to how Netflix or Spotify work today.",
    "**In-Kind Exchange**: In a cashless society, people might rely more on in-kind exchange, where they barter goods or services for other goods or services. This could lead to a more localized and community-oriented economy."
