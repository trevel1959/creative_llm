    "**Poor Soil Quality**: Another issue that may arise is poor soil quality. If the soil lacks essential nutrients or has poor drainage, it can hinder plant growth and lead to a range of problems, including root rot and pest infestations.",
    "**Inadequate Watering**: Inadequate watering can be a significant problem in gardening, particularly during periods of drought or extreme heat. If plants are not receiving enough water, they may become stressed, leading to reduced growth and increased susceptibility to disease.",
    "**Pest Infestations**: Pests such as aphids, slugs, and snails can quickly damage plants and spread disease. If left unchecked, pest infestations can lead to significant losses in crop yield and quality.",
    "**Lack of Space**: A common problem when planting a backyard garden is the lack of space. With limited space, it can be challenging to accommodate multiple plants, leading to overcrowding and reduced growth.",
    "**Weather Extremes**: Weather extremes such as heavy rainfall, strong winds, or intense sunlight can cause damage to plants and disrupt the garden's ecosystem. This can lead to a range of problems, including soil erosion, plant stress, and reduced yields."
