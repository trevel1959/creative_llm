    "Alternative Energy Sources: If the world were to run out of oil, there would be a pressing need to explore alternative energy sources. One such source could be harnessing the power of the sun through solar panels. This would not only provide a clean and renewable source of energy but also reduce our reliance on fossil fuels.",
    "Transportation Revolution: With oil becoming scarce, there would be a shift towards alternative modes of transportation. Electric and hydrogen-powered vehicles could become the norm, reducing emissions and dependence on oil. Additionally, investment in advanced public transportation systems, such as magnetic levitation trains, could provide efficient and eco-friendly alternatives to traditional cars and buses.",
    "Carbon Capture and Utilization: As oil reserves dwindle, there could be a focus on capturing and utilizing carbon dioxide emissions. This technology could convert CO2 into valuable products such as fuels, chemicals, and building materials, providing an alternative to oil and reducing emissions.",
    "Urban Agriculture: With food production becoming more challenging due to climate change and resource depletion, urban agriculture could become a vital solution. Vertical farming, hydroponics, and other sustainable agricultural practices could provide a local and sustainable source of food, reducing the need for long-distance transportation and reliance on fossil fuels.",
    "Space Exploration: As oil reserves decline, humanity could turn its attention to the stars. Space exploration and colonization could provide a new frontier for energy production, mining, and resource extraction. This would not only provide a sustainable source of energy but also offer a safety net for humanity in the event of catastrophic events on Earth."
