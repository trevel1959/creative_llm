    "Utilize the island's natural resources: To survive on a deserted island, the first step would be to assess the resources available on the island. Look for coconuts, fruits, and other edible plants that can provide sustenance. Collect rainwater or find a source of fresh water. Use the island's materials like palm fronds or vines to create a shelter. Harness the sun's energy by building a solar oven or using a magnifying glass to cook food.",
    "Create a fishing net: With some vines or nets, create a fishing net to catch fish and other sea creatures in the surrounding waters. This will provide a source of protein and help sustain your survival. Use rocks or shells to create weights and floats to help the net stay submerged and catch fish.",
    "Build a signal fire: To signal for help, build a fire on a hill or a high point on the island. Use dry wood and other flammable materials to create a fire that can be seen from a distance. Keep the fire burning throughout the day and night to increase visibility. You can also create a mirror or reflective surface to reflect sunlight towards any passing boats or planes.",
    "Make a signal mirror: Create a signal mirror by cutting a piece of glass or plastic and polishing it until it's smooth. Use a piece of tape or glue to attach a piece of foil or aluminum to the back of the mirror. This will help reflect sunlight towards any passing boats or planes. Hold the mirror at a 45-degree angle towards the sun and move it back and forth to create a flashing effect.",
    "Create a compass: Use a magnetized needle to create a compass. Place the needle on a piece of cardboard or wood and attach it to a small stick or paddle. Mark the north direction on the stick with a small notch or line. The needle will align with the Earth's magnetic field, allowing you to determine the direction of the island and any potential rescuers."
