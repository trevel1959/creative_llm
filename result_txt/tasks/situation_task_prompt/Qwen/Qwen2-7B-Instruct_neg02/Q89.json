    "**Biodegradable Plant-Based Plastics**: Develop a range of plastics made from renewable resources like corn starch, potato starch, or cellulose. These can be used for packaging, cutlery, and other single-use items. They decompose naturally in soil, reducing landfill waste.",
    "**Natural Fibers**: Utilize natural fibers such as hemp, bamboo, and flax to replace traditional plastics in various applications. For example, hemp can be used for clothing, bedding, and even some types of bags, while bamboo can replace plastic in kitchenware and other household items.",
    "**Recycled Materials**: Implement recycling programs that collect and repurpose waste materials into new products. This could include using old newspapers, cardboard, and other paper products to make durable containers and furniture. It also involves recycling metal scraps into new products.",
    "**Innovative Compostable Materials**: Create a line of compostable plastics made from food waste or agricultural byproducts. These materials can be used for food packaging and utensils, which can then be composted after use, returning nutrients back to the earth.",
    "**Nano-Composite Materials**: Develop advanced composite materials that combine natural fibers, metals, and other substances at a nanoscale level. These could offer enhanced properties like strength, flexibility, and durability compared to traditional plastics. They can be used in construction, automotive, and aerospace industries."
