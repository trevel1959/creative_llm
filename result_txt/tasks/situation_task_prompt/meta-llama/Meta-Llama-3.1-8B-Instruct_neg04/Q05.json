    "**Solar-powered Umbrella**: Design a portable, collapsible umbrella with built-in solar panels that can charge a battery during the day. The umbrella's fabric would be specially designed to maximize sunlight absorption, and the battery would power a string of LED lights or a small lantern, providing a reliable source of light during the day. This would be especially useful for people who need to work or travel outdoors.",
    "**Bioluminescent Plants**: Develop a line of bioluminescent plants that can thrive in a variety of environments and produce a soft, ethereal glow. These plants could be used to create a network of glowing pathways, making it easier to navigate through dark areas. They could also be used to create ambient lighting for homes, restaurants, or other public spaces.",
    "**Luminescent Paint**: Create a special paint that absorbs and stores light energy during the day, releasing it as a soft glow at night. This paint could be used to create a variety of decorative effects, such as glowing murals, street art, or even glowing furniture. It would be a unique and sustainable way to add ambiance to any space.",
    "**Glowing Fiber Optic Cables**: Develop a system of glowing fiber optic cables that can be installed in public spaces, such as sidewalks, streets, or parks. These cables would be designed to absorb and store light energy during the day, releasing it as a soft glow at night. This would provide a safe and energy-efficient way to light public areas.",
    "**Personal Light Generators**: Design a portable, wearable device that can generate light using a combination of solar panels, piezoelectric materials, and advanced LED technology. This device would be powered by the user's movements, such as walking or running, and would provide a reliable source of light during the day. It would be especially useful for people who need to work or travel in areas with limited lighting. [/INST] "
