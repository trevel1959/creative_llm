    "**3D Haptic Feedback System**: Design a computer mouse that incorporates haptic feedback technology to provide tactile sensations when interacting with virtual objects in 3D environments. This could enhance the user's sense of presence and immersion, making tasks like gaming, 3D modeling, or VR exploration more engaging and realistic.",
    "**Gesture-Controlled Mouse**: Create a computer mouse that can interpret hand gestures for additional functionality. Users could perform simple commands like scrolling, clicking, or zooming without needing to move their fingers from the mouse. This could be particularly useful for users with limited mobility or for those who prefer non-traditional input methods.",
    "**AI-Powered Personalized Mouse**: Develop a smart mouse that learns and adapts to the user's typing and usage patterns. The mouse could adjust its sensitivity, button mapping, or even predict what action the user is likely to perform next based on historical data. This personalization could significantly improve productivity and comfort over time.",
    "**Wireless Charging and Energy Harvesting**: Integrate wireless charging capabilities into the mouse design, allowing it to charge automatically when placed on a charging pad. Additionally, incorporate small energy harvesting technologies (like piezoelectric materials) to extend battery life or even recharge the device while in use. This sustainable feature would appeal to environmentally conscious users.",
    "**Biometric Authentication Mouse**: Implement biometric sensors within the mouse to enable secure authentication using fingerprints, palm prints, or other biometric data. This would eliminate the need for traditional passwords or physical tokens, providing an extra layer of security for sensitive applications. It also ensures that the mouse remains locked when not in use, preventing unauthorized access."
