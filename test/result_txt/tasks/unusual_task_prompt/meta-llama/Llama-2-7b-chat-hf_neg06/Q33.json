    "SpongeBob SquarePants-themed virtual reality experience: Create a fully immersive VR experience where users can explore the underwater world of Bikini Bottom as SpongeBob and his friends. From jellyfish forests to coral reefs, users can interact with the characters and environments, even play games and solve puzzles. This VR experience could be a fun and unique way for fans of the show to engage with their favorite characters in a new and exciting way.",
    "Sponge-inspired sustainable building materials: Take inspiration from the sponge's unique structure and create a new type of sustainable building material. The sponge's porous nature could be replicated using natural or recycled materials, such as hemp or recycled plastic, to create a lightweight and energy-efficient building material. This material could be used for everything from insulation to roofing, providing a sustainable alternative to traditional building materials.",
    "Sponge-based water filtration system: Design a water filtration system that uses the sponge's porous structure to remove impurities from water. The sponge could be used to filter out pollutants and contaminants, leaving clean water that is safe for drinking or other uses. This system could be especially useful in areas where access to clean water is limited.",
    "Sponge-powered electricity generation: Create a device that harnesses the energy of the sponge to generate electricity. The sponge's porous structure could be used to capture and convert the kinetic energy of moving water into electrical energy. This device could be used in areas where access to electricity is limited, providing a sustainable and renewable source of energy.",
    "Sponge-based art installation: Create a large-scale art installation that features thousands of sponges arranged in a intricate design. The sponges could be suspended from the ceiling or mounted on walls, creating a colorful and eye-catching display. The installation could be designed to change color or pattern based on sound or light, creating a dynamic and interactive experience for viewers. This installation could be used in museums, galleries, or public spaces to add a touch of whimsy and creativity to any space."
