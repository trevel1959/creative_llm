    "Herbal remedies: One approach to treating a common cold in a world without medication would be to rely on herbal remedies. Certain herbs, such as eucalyptus, peppermint, and ginger, have natural decongestant and anti-inflammatory properties that could help alleviate symptoms of a cold. Tea made from these herbs, or taken in supplement form, could be a viable alternative to over-the-counter medications.",
    "Saltwater rinse: Another option for treating a cold in a medication-free world would be to use a saltwater rinse. The antibacterial properties of salt could help reduce inflammation in the nasal passages and throat, and the warm water could help loosen and clear mucus. This remedy could be done by mixing 1/4 teaspoon of salt in a cup of warm water and gargling several times a day.",
    "Honey and lemon: Honey has antibacterial and anti-inflammatory properties, and when combined with the acidity of lemon, could provide relief from a sore throat and cough. Mixing a spoonful of honey with warm water or tea could be an effective and natural way to treat a cold.",
    "Gargling with apple cider vinegar: Apple cider vinegar has antibacterial and antiviral properties, making it a potential treatment for a cold. Gargling with undiluted apple cider vinegar several times a day could help reduce inflammation in the throat and nasal passages.",
    "Aromatherapy: Essential oils such as eucalyptus, peppermint, and tea tree oil have natural decongestant and anti-inflammatory properties, and could be used to treat a cold through aromatherapy. By inhaling these oils through steam inhalation or using them in a diffuser, these oils could help alleviate symptoms of a cold without the use of medication."
