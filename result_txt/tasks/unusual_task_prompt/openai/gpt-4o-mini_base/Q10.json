    "**Miniature Catapult**: Repurpose a pen into a small catapult for fun games or science experiments. By disassembling the pen and using the spring mechanism, you can create a simple lever system. Attach a small spoon or piece of cardboard as the launching pad and use lightweight objects like marshmallows or paper balls as projectiles. This can be a great educational tool to demonstrate physics principles.",
    "**Travel Sewing Kit**: Convert a pen into a portable sewing kit. Remove the ink cartridge and fill the pen body with a few needles, some thread, and a couple of buttons.

    "**Art Tool for Doodling**: Use a pen to create intricate art designs by modifying its tip. You can attach a small piece of sponge or felt to the tip to create a stamp-like effect.

    "**DIY Compass**: Use a pen to create a simple compass for outdoor navigation. Take a pen, tie a piece of thread around the barrel, and attach a small weight (like a washer) to the end of the thread. Hold the pen upright and let it hang freely; the weighted end will point towards magnetic north, helping you orient yourself in unfamiliar surroundings.",
