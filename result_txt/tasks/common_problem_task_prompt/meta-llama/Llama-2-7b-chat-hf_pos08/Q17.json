    "Floating Olympic Venues: Create floating venues that can be placed in different bodies of water around the host city. This would not only provide a unique and memorable experience for athletes and spectators but also showcase the city's commitment to sustainability and innovation. The floating venues could be designed to be easily disassembled and reused in future Olympics, reducing waste and environmental impact.",
    "Virtual Reality Events: Utilize virtual reality technology to host Olympic events that are not possible in a traditional setting. For example, a virtual reality skiing event could be held in a virtual snowy mountain range, allowing athletes from around the world to compete in a variety of events without the need for expensive and environmentally harmful travel. This would also provide an opportunity for athletes to train and compete in a variety of virtual environments, improving their skills and overall performance.",
    "Interactive Fan Experience: Create an immersive and interactive fan experience that allows spectators to engage with the Olympics in new and innovative ways. This could include virtual reality and augmented reality experiences that allow fans to feel like they are part of the action, as well as interactive exhibits and installations that provide an in-depth look at the history and culture of the Olympics.",
    "Sustainable Venue Design: Design the Olympic venues with sustainability in mind, using materials and technologies that minimize environmental impact. This could include the use of recycled materials, solar panels, and green roofs, as well as innovative waste management systems that reduce waste and improve air quality. This would not only showcase the host city's commitment to sustainability but also provide a healthier and more comfortable environment for athletes and spectators.",
    "Global Cultural Exchange: Use the Olympics as a platform for cultural exchange and understanding between different countries and regions. This could include hosting cultural events and exhibitions that showcase the traditions and customs of different nations, as well as providing opportunities for athletes and spectators to learn about and experience different cultures. This would help to promote understanding and respect between different cultures, fostering a sense of global community and cooperation."
