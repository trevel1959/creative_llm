    "**Eco-Friendly Detergent Dispenser**: Design a washing machine that uses a built-in compartment for eco-friendly, concentrated detergent pods. This dispenser would automatically release the right amount of detergent based on the load size and soil level, reducing waste and encouraging the use of sustainable products. The machine could also have a feature to alert users when itâ€™s time to refill the detergent.",
    "**Self-Cleaning Mechanism**: Incorporate a self-cleaning feature that uses UV light and steam to sanitize the drum and hoses after each wash cycle. This would prevent the buildup of mold and bacteria, eliminate odors, and reduce the need for manual cleaning, making maintenance easier for users.",
    "**Mobile App Integration with Remote Diagnostics**: Develop a mobile app that connects to the washing machine, allowing users to start, stop, or schedule washes remotely. The app could also provide diagnostic information, alerting users to potential issues before they become serious problems. This feature would enable users to troubleshoot issues without needing a technician, saving time and money.",
    "**Soundproofing and Vibration Control**: Innovate a design that includes advanced soundproofing materials and vibration control technology to minimize noise during operation. This could be particularly appealing for urban dwellers or those living in apartments, allowing them to run their washing machines at any time without disturbing their household or neighbors.",
    "**Interactive Touchscreen Interface**: Replace traditional dials and buttons with an interactive touchscreen interface that offers a more user-friendly experience. This could include customizable wash programs, instructional videos for different fabric care, and even a virtual assistant to guide users through the washing process. Users could also save their favorite settings for quick access."
