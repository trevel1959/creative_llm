    "**Weather Conditions**: The weather on Everest can be unpredictable and extreme, with sudden storms, high winds, and frigid temperatures. Climbers may face blizzards that can lead to disorientation and frostbite. To mitigate this risk, climbers should have access to reliable weather forecasting tools and establish contingency plans for quick descent or shelter.",
    "**Physical Fitness and Training**: Many climbers underestimate the physical demands of climbing Everest. Insufficient physical preparation can lead to exhaustion and inability to complete the ascent. A rigorous training regimen, including endurance, strength, and technical climbing skills, is essential to prepare for the climb and ensure climbers can handle the physical strain.",
    "**Equipment Failure**: The harsh environment of Everest can lead to gear malfunction or failure, such as broken crampons, faulty oxygen tanks, or torn tents. This can jeopardize a climber's safety and success. Climbers must ensure they have high-quality gear, conduct thorough pre-climb checks, and have backup equipment ready in case of emergencies.",
    "**Crowding and Traffic Jams**: The popularity of Everest has led to overcrowding on the summit routes, creating dangerous bottlenecks where climbers may be stuck in extreme conditions for extended periods. This can increase the risk of exhaustion and altitude sickness. Solutions include limiting the number of permits issued, promoting off-peak climbing seasons, and encouraging climbers to adopt a more staggered ascent strategy.",
    "**Environmental Impact**: The increase in climbers has raised concerns about litter and waste left on the mountain, leading to environmental degradation. Solutions could involve implementing strict waste management protocols, requiring climbers to bring down their trash, and organizing regular clean-up expeditions to preserve the mountain's natural beauty."
