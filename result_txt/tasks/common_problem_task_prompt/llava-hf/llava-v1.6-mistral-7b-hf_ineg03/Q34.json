This could lead to a decrease in face-to-face communication and social skills, particularly among younger generations who grow up interacting more with robots than with people.",
    "**Regulatory Framework**: As robots become more prevalent, there may be a need for a regulatory framework to ensure their safe and ethical use. This could include regulations on robot design, operation, and interaction with humans.",
    "**Education and Skill Development**: The rise of robots could lead to a need for new educational programs to teach people how to work with and control robots. This could include both technical skills, such as programming and robotics, as well as softer skills like empathy and communication."
