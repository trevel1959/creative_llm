    "Texture: Another way to differentiate objects would be to examine their texture. A smooth clock face would be distinguishable from a textured one, even in black and white.",
    "Size: The size of objects can also be a distinguishing factor. A large clock would be easily distinguishable from a small clock, even in black and white.",
    "Material: The material of an object can also be a distinguishing factor. For example, a wooden clock would have a different texture and appearance compared to a metal clock, even in black and white.",
    "Pattern: The pattern on an object can also be a distinguishing factor. For example, a clock with a grid pattern would be distinguishable from a clock with a solid color pattern, even in black and white.",
    "Context: The context in which an object is placed can also be a distinguishing factor. For example, a clock on a desk would be distinguishable from a clock on a shelf, even in black and white."
