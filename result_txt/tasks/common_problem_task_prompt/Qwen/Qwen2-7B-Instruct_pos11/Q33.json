    "**Innovative Aquaculture System**: Create a simple yet effective aquaculture system to cultivate fish and shellfish. This could involve setting up nets in the ocean near the island, using local materials for buoyancy, and possibly building a small structure to house the nets and provide shade. Fish can be fed with natural sources like insects or plants, while shellfish can be collected from the beach. This not only provides a sustainable source of protein but also allows for a variety of nutrients through a diverse diet.",
    "**Natural Solar Still**: Construct a solar still to distill water from seawater. This involves creating a large, clear container (like a plastic sheet) that captures sunlight, which heats up the water inside. As the water heats, it evaporates, leaving behind salt and minerals. The steam then condenses on the cooler surface above, dripping back into a collection container below. This method can provide a reliable source of fresh drinking water, essential for survival.",
    "**Biodegradable Shelter Building**: Utilize local resources to build a shelter that is both sturdy and sustainable. Materials like coconut fronds, bamboo, and vines can be used to construct a shelter that is strong enough to withstand wind and rain. The structure should have an open-air design to allow for ventilation and air circulation, preventing mold and moisture buildup. The use of natural materials ensures that the shelter will decompose over time, minimizing environmental impact once you are ready to leave the island.",
    "**Survival Garden**: Establish a garden using a no-dig method to conserve soil moisture and minimize the need for heavy labor. Start by collecting fallen leaves, twigs, and other organic matter to create a layer that will decompose over time, enriching the soil. Plant a variety of seeds that are native to the area, which are more likely to thrive without much intervention. Include a mix of vegetables, fruits, and herbs to ensure a balanced diet. To make the most of limited space, consider vertical gardening techniques like trellises for climbing plants.",
    "**Crafting Tools from Natural Resources**: Develop tools and utensils using the abundant resources found on the island. For example, sharpened sticks can serve as spears for catching fish or game, while larger pieces of wood can be carved into knives or axes. Twine made from plant fibers can be used for sewing clothing or repairing gear. By learning basic carpentry and tool-making skills, you can create a wide range of useful items necessary for daily life and potentially trade with any potential resc"
