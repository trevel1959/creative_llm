By seeing through walls, they could identify potential blind spots and weaknesses in existing security measures. This insight would enable them to develop more effective surveillance systems and improve overall security protocols, ultimately preventing theft and ensuring public safety.",
    "**Medical Advancements**: In the field of medicine, being able to see through walls could revolutionize diagnostics and treatment. Doctors could visualize the internal anatomy of patients without the need for invasive procedures or imaging technology. This could lead to earlier detection of conditions, more precise treatments, and a significant reduction in healthcare costs. Additionally, this ability could facilitate training for medical students, allowing them to gain a deeper understanding of human anatomy in a more interactive way.",
