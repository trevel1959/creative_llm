    "**Microwave Air Fryer**: Develop a microwave-safe basket or tray that allows you to cook foods like fries, chicken wings, and vegetables as if they were air-fried. The design would include perforations for hot air circulation and possibly a timer or sensor to ensure the food reaches the desired crispiness without burning.",
    "**Microwave Slow Cooker**: Create a large microwave-safe container with a lid that has adjustable settings to mimic slow-cooking methods. This appliance could be used for cooking tough cuts of meat, stews, or soups at a lower temperature, which can save energy and time compared to traditional slow cookers.",
    "**Microwave Steam Cooker**: Design a modular system where multiple microwave-safe containers can stack on top of each other to steam different foods simultaneously. This setup could include a water reservoir and a vented lid to maintain a steady level of steam inside each container.",
    "**Microwave Composting Kit**: Introduce a composting solution specifically designed for use in microwaves. This could involve a small container filled with microorganisms and organic waste, which can be heated to high temperatures to speed up the composting process. This is an eco-friendly way to reduce food waste in households.",
    "**Microwave Sous Vide Machine**: Combine sous vide cooking techniques with microwave technology to offer a precise temperature control for cooking food within vacuum-sealed bags. This device would use a digital interface to set specific temperatures and times, allowing for perfectly cooked dishes every time. The microwave would act as a secondary heating source when needed, ensuring that the water bath maintains its temperature throughout the cooking process."
