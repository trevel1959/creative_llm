    "A Smart Mailbox with AI-Powered Sorting: Create a mailbox that utilizes artificial intelligence to automatically sort and categorize incoming mail. This smart mailbox would use computer vision and machine learning algorithms to recognize the sender, type of mail, and prioritize important messages. Users could access their mail through a mobile app, and the AI system would learn and adapt to their preferences over time.",
    "A Mailbox with Built-in Security Measures: Design a mailbox that includes advanced security features to protect users' privacy and prevent identity theft. This could include a fingerprint scanner, facial recognition software, or a smart lock that only opens with a specific code or biometric data. The mailbox could also have a tamper-proof design to prevent unauthorized access.",
    "A Personalized Mailbox with Augmented Reality: Create a mailbox that uses augmented reality (AR) technology to provide users with a unique and interactive experience. The mailbox could display virtual information about the sender, such as their name, address, or a personalized message. Users could also use AR to open and view the contents of their mail without physically opening the box.",
    "A Self-Sustaining Mailbox: Design a mailbox that can generate its own power and sustain itself indefinitely. This could involve incorporating solar panels, wind turbines, or other eco-friendly energy sources. The mailbox could also have a built-in composting system for disposing of biodegradable materials, reducing waste and environmental impact.",
    "A Social Mailbox for Shared Living Spaces: Create a mailbox that can be used by multiple people in a shared living space, such as an apartment building or office complex. This could involve designing a mailbox with multiple compartments or a centralized sorting system that directs mail to the appropriate recipient. The mailbox could also include a social feature that allows users to communicate with each other through a messaging system or digital platform."
