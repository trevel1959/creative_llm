    "**Aurorin**: A color that shifts between soft blues and purples, evoking the gentle hues of a sunrise. I would use Aurorin in art installations that capture the serenity of dawn, creating an immersive experience for viewers. Imagine walking into a room filled with walls that gradually transition from deep blues to soft purples, as if the sky itself was unfolding within.",
    "**Lumina**: A color that combines the brightness of neon with the depth of iridescent sheens.

The dynamic, shifting hues would make the structures seem alive, as if they were radiating an inner light.",
    "**Nexarion**: A color that appears as a mesmerizing, swirling pattern of dark greens and blues, reminiscent of the mysteries of the ocean. I would use Nexarion in the design of aquariums and marine parks, allowing visitors to feel as though they're submerged in the depths of the sea. The hypnotic color would draw people in, fostering a deeper appreciation for marine life and the importance of conservation.",
    "**Solaria**: A vibrant, warm color that seems to pulse with energy, like the intense light of a sunflower. I would incorporate Solaria into the design of solar panels and renewable energy systems, making them more visually appealing and inviting. As people interact with the colorful panels, they'd be reminded of the importance of harnessing clean energy and reducing our reliance on fossil fuels.",
    "**Aerthys**: A color that shifts between soft grays and silvers, evoking the ethereal quality of clouds and mist. I would use Aerthys in the design of airports, train stations, and other transportation hubs, creating a sense of calm and serenity amidst the hustle and bustle of travel. The color would help reduce stress and anxiety, making the travel experience more enjoyable and peaceful. </s> "
