    "**Funding and Resource Allocation**: Vaccine development is an expensive and time-consuming process. Securing adequate funding can be a significant hurdle, especially if the disease is not yet widely recognized or does not pose an immediate threat to public health. This can lead to delays in research, limited testing capabilities, and an inability to attract top talent in the field.",
    "**Regulatory Hurdles**: Navigating the regulatory landscape for vaccine approval can be complex and time-consuming. There may be varying requirements from different countries, and meeting these regulations can slow down the development process. Additionally, the need for ethical approval for clinical trials can create further delays.",
    "**Public Skepticism and Misinformation**: As the vaccine is being developed, there may be a rise in public skepticism or misinformation regarding its safety and efficacy. This can hinder recruitment for clinical trials, affect public willingness to get vaccinated once itâ€™s available, and complicate communication strategies that aim to build trust in the vaccine.",
    "**Manufacturing Challenges**: Once a vaccine candidate is identified, scaling up production can present numerous challenges. Issues such as quality control, consistency in manufacturing processes, and supply chain logistics for raw materials can all impact the ability to produce the vaccine in sufficient quantities and in a timely manner.",
    "**Post-Market Surveillance and Long-Term Efficacy**: After the vaccine is released to the public, ongoing monitoring for adverse effects and long-term efficacy becomes critical. There may be unforeseen side effects that only emerge after widespread use, leading to potential public health crises and the need for booster shots or reformulations of the vaccine."
