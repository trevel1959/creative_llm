    "Space Constraints: Another issue that may arise is the limited space available on rooftops in densely populated urban areas. In these situations, homeowners may not have enough space to accommodate the necessary solar panels, which could limit their ability to generate enough energy to meet their needs.",
    "Energy Storage: With an increased reliance on solar energy, there may be a need for more efficient energy storage solutions to ensure a stable power supply when the sun is not shining. This could lead to additional costs and logistical challenges.",
    "Aesthetics: Some homeowners may be hesitant to install solar panels due to their appearance. While solar panels are becoming more visually appealing, some people may still find them unattractive and may prefer other forms of renewable energy.",
    "Maintenance: Solar panels require regular maintenance to ensure optimal performance. This could include cleaning, inspecting, and replacing damaged or worn-out components. If homeowners are not diligent about maintaining their solar panels, their efficiency and lifespan may be compromised.",
    "Interconnectedness: As more homes in a city are equipped with solar panels, there may be issues with interconnectedness between the systems. This could lead to power fluctuations or even blackouts if the grid is not properly managed."
