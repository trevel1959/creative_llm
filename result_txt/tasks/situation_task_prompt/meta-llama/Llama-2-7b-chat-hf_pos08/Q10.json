    "Community-based healthcare: With the absence of doctors and medical facilities, a community-based healthcare system could be established. This system would prioritize preventive care, education, and early detection of illnesses through regular check-ups and home visits by community health workers. Neighborhood clinics could be set up to provide basic medical care, and a network of community health workers could be trained to identify and address health issues.",
    "Mobile health clinics: Mobile health clinics could be established to provide medical care to people in remote areas. These clinics could be equipped with basic medical equipment and staffed by healthcare professionals who could travel to different areas to provide medical care. This would ensure that people in remote areas have access to medical care, even if they cannot reach a fixed clinic.",
    "DIY healthcare: In the absence of doctors and medical facilities, people could be encouraged to take a more active role in their healthcare. This could involve learning basic first aid techniques, practicing self-care, and using DIY medical tools such as blood pressure monitors, thermometers, and stethoscopes. People could also be encouraged to share their medical knowledge and experiences with each other, creating a community-driven approach to healthcare.",
    "Herbalism and traditional medicine: In many cultures, herbalism and traditional medicine have been used for centuries to treat illnesses. With the absence of modern medicine, people could turn to these traditional practices to address their health needs. This could involve learning about the medicinal properties of local plants and using them to treat illnesses, as well as practicing other traditional healing practices such as acupuncture and massage.",
    "Bartering and sharing: In a post-doctor world, people could turn to bartering and sharing as a way to obtain medical care. This could involve exchanging goods or services with other people in exchange for medical care, or creating a system of sharing medical resources. For example, people could share their own medical supplies or offer their services as healthcare providers to others in need. This could help to create a sense of community and cooperation in the face of adversity."
