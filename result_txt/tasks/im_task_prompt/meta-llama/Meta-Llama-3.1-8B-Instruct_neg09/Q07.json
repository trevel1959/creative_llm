The toothbrush would have sensors to detect plaque, gum inflammation, and tooth decay, providing users with personalized recommendations for improvement. The AI system could also integrate with wearable devices and electronic health records to offer a comprehensive view of overall health. Users could access their oral health data through a mobile app, enabling them to make informed decisions about their dental care.",
    "**Toothbrush with Built-in UV Light for Sanitization**: Develop a toothbrush with a built-in UV light that sanitizes the bristles after each use. This feature would eliminate the need for manual cleaning and reduce the risk of bacterial transmission. The UV light could be powered by a rechargeable battery, and the toothbrush could be designed with a compact, travel-friendly size.",
    "**Toothbrush with Integrated Whitening Strips**: Create a toothbrush that comes with built-in whitening strips or a detachable whitening module. The strips would be infused with a gentle, non-abrasive whitening agent that is activated by the toothbrush's gentle vibrations. This feature would allow users to achieve professional-grade whitening results at home, with the convenience of a single product.",
    "**Toothbrush with 3D-Printed Customizable Bristles**: Design a toothbrush with 3D-printed bristles that can be customized to fit individual users' oral anatomy. The bristles would be tailored to address specific oral health concerns, such as sensitive teeth or gums. This feature would enable users to achieve optimal cleaning and comfort with a toothbrush that is tailored to their unique needs.",
    "**Toothbrush with Built-in Water Flosser and Tongue Cleaner**: Develop a toothbrush that combines a water flosser and tongue cleaner into a single device. The water flosser would use a gentle stream of water to remove plaque and debris from between teeth and below the gumline, while the tongue cleaner would remove bacteria and freshen breath. This feature would provide users with a comprehensive oral hygiene routine in a single, convenient product.
