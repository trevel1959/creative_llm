    "Bamboo Houses - Bamboo is a highly sustainable and renewable resource that can be used to build houses. Bamboo is lightweight, durable, and can be found in abundance in many parts of the world. With the right design and engineering, bamboo houses could provide a sturdy and eco-friendly alternative to traditional building materials. Confidence Score: 0.8",
    "Hydroponic Towers - If natural materials were to disappear, hydroponic towers could provide a solution for growing food. These towers use nutrient-rich water rather than soil to grow plants, reducing the need for land and resources. The towers could be built using materials like recycled metal and plastic, and could be stacked together to create a vertically integrated food system. Confidence Score: 0.9",
    "Solar Sails - Solar sails are a type of spacecraft that use the sun's radiation pressure to propel them through space. By harnessing the power of the sun, solar sails could provide a means of transportation without relying on traditional fuels. While the technology is still in its infancy, it could potentially be used to build homes or other structures in space. Confidence Score: 0.8",
    "Geodesic Domes - Geodesic domes are lightweight, strong, and can be built using a variety of materials, including recycled plastic. These domes are ideal for building structures in challenging environments, such as disaster zones or remote areas with limited resources. By using a geodesic dome structure, it would be possible to create a durable and sustainable home without relying on traditional building materials. Confidence Score: 0.9",
    "Air-Filled Buildings - In the absence of natural materials, buildings could be inflated with air or other gases to create a lightweight and durable structure. This could be achieved using a combination of advanced materials and inflation technology. Air-filled buildings could provide a unique and sustainable solution for building homes or other structures in the future. Confidence Score: 0.8"
