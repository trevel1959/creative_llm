    "Thermal Mass Storage: Create a thermal mass storage system that utilizes large, thick concrete or stone slabs to absorb and release heat during the day. These slabs would be placed in strategic locations throughout the building, such as in walls, floors, or ceilings. During the day, when the sun heats the slabs, they will absorb and store the heat, and at night, they will release the stored heat to maintain a comfortable indoor temperature.",
    "Phase Change Materials: Incorporate phase change materials (PCMs) into building insulation. PCMs are materials that can absorb and release heat energy as they change phase from solid to liquid or vice versa. By incorporating these materials into building insulation, the building will be able to regulate its temperature more efficiently, as the PCMs will absorb and release heat as needed.",
    "Greenhouses: Create a greenhouse-like structure on the roof of the building, using transparent materials such as glass or polycarbonate. This will allow sunlight to enter the building during the day and warm it up, while also providing insulation to keep the heat in. At night, the greenhouse will help to retain the heat, keeping the building warm.",
    "Thermal Bridge Coatings: Apply thermal bridge coatings to all structural elements that connect the building's thermal envelope, such as beams, columns, and walls. These coatings are designed to reduce heat transfer between the inside and outside of the building, helping to maintain a consistent indoor temperature.",
    "Evaporative Cooling: Implement an evaporative cooling system that uses water to cool the building. This system works by passing hot air through a wet pad, which causes the water to evaporate and cool the air. The cooled air can then be circulated throughout the building to maintain a comfortable indoor temperature."
