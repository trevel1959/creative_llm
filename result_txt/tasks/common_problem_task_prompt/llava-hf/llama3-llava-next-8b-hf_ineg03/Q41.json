    "Life Support: Another major challenge is designing a life support system that can sustain the crew for an extended period of time. This includes providing clean air, water, and food, as well as maintaining a comfortable temperature and atmosphere. The system must also be able to recycle and purify resources to conserve space and weight.",
    "Propulsion: Propulsion is a critical aspect of spaceship design. The type of propulsion system used can greatly impact the mission's success. Options include chemical rockets, nuclear propulsion, and advanced ion propulsion. Each system has its own advantages and disadvantages, and the design must take into account the mission requirements and the available resources.",
    "Radiation Protection: Space is filled with radiation from the sun and other sources. A spaceship must be designed to protect its crew from the harmful effects of radiation, which can cause damage to the body and mind. This requires shielding materials that can absorb or deflect radiation, as well as systems for monitoring and controlling the exposure of the crew.",
    "Gravity: In space, there is no gravity, which can cause a range of issues for the crew, such as muscle atrophy, fluid shift, and balance problems. The design must include a way to simulate gravity, such as rotating the ship or using artificial gravity through centrifugal force.",
    "Psychological Effects: Long-term space missions can have significant psychological effects on the crew, such as stress, anxiety, and depression. The design must take into account the psychological well-being of the crew, including providing opportunities for exercise, recreation, and social interaction."
