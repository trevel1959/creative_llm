    "**Self-Whisking Mechanism**: Develop a whisk that can automatically whisk ingredients with the push of a button. This would be particularly useful for those with limited wrist strength or for tasks that require prolonged whisking, like whipping egg whites or cream. The self-whisking mechanism could include adjustable speed settings and a timer, allowing users to walk away and multitask while the whisk does the work.",
    "**Interchangeable Whisk Heads**: Create a whisk with interchangeable heads designed for various tasksâ€”such as a balloon whisk for aerating, a flat whisk for scraping, and a spiral whisk for mixing thick batters. This would allow users to customize their whisk based on the specific cooking task, reducing the need for multiple tools and saving space in the kitchen.",
    "**Ergonomic Design with Comfort Grip**: Redesign the handle of the whisk to be more ergonomic, featuring a soft, non-slip grip that molds to the user's hand. This design could include a thumb rest and an angled handle to reduce strain on the wrist during prolonged use. Additionally, the whisk could be made from lightweight materials to further enhance comfort and ease of use.",
    "**Whisk with Built-in Measuring Tools**: Integrate measuring spoons and cups into the design of the whisk handle. This would allow users to measure ingredients directly as they whisk, streamlining the cooking process. The measuring tools could be retractable or designed to fold away when not in use, maintaining a sleek appearance.",
    "**Whisk with a Built-in Timer and Recipe Guide**: Equip the whisk with a small digital display that can show a timer and pre-programmed recipes. Users could select a recipe, and the whisk would guide them through the process, including timing for each whisking phase. This feature could help novice cooks follow recipes more accurately and improve their culinary skills."
