    "**Lanterns and Flashlights**: One creative solution could be to prepare for the lack of sunlight by carrying around lanterns or flashlights. These can be used in indoor spaces where natural light is insufficient. Additionally, these devices can provide light during the day if there's any unexpected power outage.",
    "**Solar Panels as Backup**: If there are concerns about the total absence of sunlight, having portable solar panels can be an excellent backup option. These can be used to charge batteries or directly power electronic devices during the day, ensuring light and electricity even when the sun doesn't rise.",
    "**Light Reflectors**: Another innovative idea is to create or use existing reflective surfaces like mirrors or metallic sheets. These can reflect available light sources (such as street lights, car headlights, etc.) into darker areas, providing additional illumination during the day.",
    "**Bioluminescent Plants and Fungi**: Cultivating bioluminescent plants or fungi can offer a sustainable source of light. These organisms naturally emit light, which can be used indoors or in dark areas. This method requires some initial setup but can provide long-term light solutions.",
    "**Energy Storage**: Utilizing renewable energy sources such as wind turbines or hydroelectric generators can store energy for use when sunlight isn't available. This setup would involve a comprehensive system including storage batteries and possibly solar panels to recharge the batteries during daylight hours. The stored energy can then be used to power lighting systems throughout the day. "
