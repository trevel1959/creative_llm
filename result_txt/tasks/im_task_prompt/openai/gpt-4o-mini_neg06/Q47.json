    "**Self-Cleaning Mechanism**: Design a vacuum cleaner with a self-cleaning feature that automatically cleans its brushes and filters after each use. This could involve a compartment that uses a combination of water and cleaning solution to wash the components, ensuring that the vacuum maintains peak performance without requiring manual intervention.",
    "**Eco-Friendly Design**: Create a vacuum cleaner made from sustainable materials, such as recycled plastics and biodegradable components. Additionally, it could feature energy-efficient motors and a mode that uses less power for lighter cleaning tasks, appealing to environmentally conscious consumers and reducing overall energy consumption.",
    "**Modular Attachments**: Develop a vacuum cleaner with interchangeable modular attachments tailored for specific cleaning tasks. For example, a specialized attachment for pet hair removal, a dusting brush for delicate surfaces, or a narrow nozzle for tight spaces. This would allow users to customize their cleaning experience based on their needs and make the vacuum more versatile.",
    "**Health Monitoring Features**: Incorporate health monitoring technology that tracks air quality as the vacuum operates. It could measure dust, allergens, and pollutants in the air, providing users with real-time feedback and tips on improving their homeâ€™s air quality. This feature would be particularly beneficial for allergy sufferers or families with young children.",
    "**Augmented Reality (AR) Integration**: Introduce an AR interface that works in conjunction with a smartphone app, allowing users to visualize dirt and debris in their home. The vacuum could highlight areas that require more attention, and users could receive cleaning tips or reminders based on the data collected during previous cleaning sessions."
