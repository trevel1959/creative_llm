    "Nature-Inspired Lamp Shade: Design a lampshade that resembles a miniature garden or landscape. This could include tiny plants, flowers, or even tiny animals, such as butterflies or birds. This would bring a touch of nature indoors and create a soothing, calming atmosphere.",
    "Interactive Lamp Shade: Create a lampshade with sensors that respond to movement or sound.
