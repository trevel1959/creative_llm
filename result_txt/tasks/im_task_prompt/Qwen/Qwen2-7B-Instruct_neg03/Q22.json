    "**Innovative Emergency Lighting System**: Design a multi-functional flashlight that not only illuminates in dark environments but also generates power through kinetic energy when shaken or moved. The flashlight can have a built-in rechargeable battery for regular use, which gets charged through the motion sensors. This system would be particularly useful in emergency situations where traditional power sources are unavailable.",
    "**Smart Flashlight with Voice Commands**: Develop a smart flashlight equipped with a microphone that allows users to give voice commands for various actions like adjusting brightness, changing light modes (e.g., white, red, blue), and even controlling other smart devices via an app on their smartphone. This would be especially helpful for visually impaired individuals or people with mobility issues who might find it challenging to use manual buttons.",
    "**Solar-Powered Flashlight with Integrated Plant Container**: Create a compact flashlight with a solar panel on top and a small container at the bottom designed to hold seeds or plants. This flashlight can charge itself during the day while providing light at night. Itâ€™s an eco-friendly solution that could be particularly beneficial in rural areas without access to electricity or for emergency kits in remote locations.",
    "**Emergency Flashlight with Built-In Air Purifier**: Design a flashlight that combines lighting functionality with air purification capabilities. This device would be invaluable in smoke-filled rooms or disaster zones where clean air is crucial. It would use UV-C technology to purify the air as it illuminates, offering a dual-purpose tool that can save lives in emergencies.",
    "**Augmented Reality Guided Flashlight**: Implement an augmented reality feature into the flashlight that overlays digital information onto the physical world. For instance, in search and rescue operations, the flashlight could display coordinates, directions, and safety instructions directly on the ground. Similarly, for hikers or campers, it could provide information about nearby landmarks, potential hazards, and survival tips, making navigation easier and safer."
