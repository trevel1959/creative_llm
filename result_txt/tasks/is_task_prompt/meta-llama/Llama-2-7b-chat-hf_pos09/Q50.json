    "Create a musical production featuring the mice as the main characters, with catchy and original songs that showcase their unique vocal abilities. The production could be a Broadway-style show, complete with elaborate costumes and sets, or a more intimate, indie-style concert.",
    "Develop a line of merchandise featuring the mice, such as plush toys, t-shirts, and mugs. Each item could have a musical theme, such as a mug with a design of the mice singing in harmony or a t-shirt with a print of the mice in their signature poses.",
    "Host a series of workshops and masterclasses taught by the mice themselves, where aspiring musicians can learn the secrets of their harmonious singing. The workshops could be held in person or online, and could cover topics such as vocal technique, songwriting, and performance.",
    "Create a mobile app that allows users to create their own musical compositions using the mice as virtual instruments. Users could select from different mouse characters, each with their own unique voice and sound, and arrange them into a song. The app could also include a social feature that allows users to share their compositions with others.",
    "Develop a line of educational materials, such as books and activity sheets, that teach children about music theory and appreciation through the lens of the mice's harmonious singing. The materials could be designed to be fun and engaging, with colorful illustrations and interactive activities."
