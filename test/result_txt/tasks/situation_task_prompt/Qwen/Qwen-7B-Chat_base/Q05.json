    "Solar-Powered Lanterns: Create a collection of solar-powered lanterns that can be used to provide light in areas without access to electricity. These lanterns could be portable and rechargeable, allowing users to take them wherever they go. The lanterns could also come in different shapes and sizes, making them suitable for various uses such as reading, cooking, or lighting up dark spaces.",
    "Solar-Powered Streetlights: Install solar-powered streetlights in areas where there is no electrical grid. These streetlights could be equipped with motion sensors, which would turn on automatically when someone walks by and turn off after a certain period of time. This would help to reduce energy consumption and save money on electricity bills.",
    "Solar-Powered Solar Panels: Install solar panels on your home or office building to generate your own electricity. These solar panels could be connected to a battery bank, which would store excess energy generated during the day for use at night. This would allow you to continue using power even if the sun doesn't rise the next day.",
    "LED Lighting: Replace traditional incandescent bulbs with LED lights in your home or office. LED lights are more energy-efficient than incandescent bulbs and last longer, which means they require less maintenance over time. Additionally, LED lights emit less heat, which can help to keep rooms cooler during hot weather.",
    "Solar-Powered Clothing: Design clothing that incorporates solar panels into its fabric. These solar panels could be used to charge electronic devices or provide additional power to small electronics like flashlights or GPS units. By incorporating solar technology into clothing, people could have access to power even in remote locations where it may not be available otherwise."
