    "Floating Wind Turbine Farm: Create a floating wind turbine farm that can harness the power of ocean winds. The turbines can be placed on floating platforms or anchored to the seafloor, allowing for a more efficient and sustainable way of generating electricity. This idea can help reduce the visual impact of traditional wind turbines on land and provide a new source of renewable energy.",
    "Solar-Powered Desalination Plant: Develop a solar-powered desalination plant that uses the energy from the sun to purify seawater or brackish water for drinking, irrigation, and industrial use. This idea can help address water scarcity in coastal areas and reduce the reliance on fossil fuels for desalination. The plant can be designed to be modular and scalable, allowing for easy deployment in different locations.",
    "Biogas Power Plant: Establish a biogas power plant that uses organic waste from agriculture, food waste, and sewage to generate electricity. The plant can be designed to capture the methane produced by anaerobic digestion of the waste, which can then be used to fuel engines or turbines to generate electricity. This idea can help reduce greenhouse gas emissions and provide a sustainable source of renewable energy.",
    "Hydrokinetic Power Plant: Develop a hydrokinetic power plant that harnesses the energy of moving water in rivers, oceans, or tidal currents to generate electricity. The plant can use turbines or generators to convert the kinetic energy of the water into electricity, providing a clean and sustainable source of power. This idea can help reduce the dependence on fossil fuels and provide a new source of renewable energy.",
    "Vertical Axis Wind Turbine Farm: Create a vertical axis wind turbine farm that can capture wind energy from any direction, making it suitable for urban environments or areas with complex wind patterns. The turbines can be placed on tall towers or buildings, allowing for a more efficient and compact design. This idea can help increase the efficiency of wind energy production in urban areas and reduce the visual impact of traditional wind turbines."
