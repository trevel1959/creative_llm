    "**Funding and Resource Allocation**: Vaccine development is expensive and requires significant investment in research, clinical trials, and manufacturing. Securing funding can be challenging, especially for diseases that may not affect large populations. A lack of financial resources could stall progress or lead to compromises in research quality.",
    "**Public Trust and Vaccine Hesitancy**: Even after a vaccine is developed, there may be widespread public skepticism or misinformation about its safety and effectiveness. This can lead to low vaccination rates, undermining herd immunity and prolonging the disease's impact. Effective communication strategies will be essential to build trust and encourage vaccination.",
    "**Distribution and Logistics**: Once a vaccine is developed, it must be manufactured at scale and distributed effectively. This includes addressing cold chain logistics, ensuring equitable access, and managing supply chain issues. Inefficiencies in distribution could result in delays and inequities in vaccination efforts.",
    "**Mutation of the Pathogen**: The pathogen responsible for the new disease may mutate over time, potentially rendering the vaccine less effective or obsolete. Continuous monitoring of the pathogen's evolution and the ability to adapt the vaccine accordingly will be critical to maintaining its effectiveness.",
    "**Adverse Reactions and Monitoring**: Post-vaccination adverse reactions, although rare, can occur and may lead to public fear or regulatory scrutiny. Establishing robust monitoring systems to track and report any adverse effects is essential to ensure ongoing safety and public confidence in the vaccine."
