This ambiguity can complicate insurance claims and legal proceedings, leading to disputes and potential financial loss for all parties involved.",
    "**Ethical Dilemmas in Decision-Making**: Self-driving cars must be programmed to make decisions in critical situations, such as choosing between hitting a pedestrian or swerving into oncoming traffic. These ethical dilemmas raise questions about how the car should be programmed to prioritize lives and make choices, which could lead to public backlash and moral debates.",
    "**Job Displacement**: The widespread adoption of self-driving cars could lead to significant job losses in sectors such as transportation, logistics, and delivery services. This displacement may create economic challenges for individuals who rely on driving jobs for their livelihood, necessitating retraining programs and government intervention to support affected workers.",
    "**Regulatory and Legal Framework**: The integration of self-driving cars into existing transportation systems poses regulatory challenges. Governments must establish clear laws and guidelines regarding the operation of autonomous vehicles, which can be time-consuming and contentious. Delays in regulation could hinder the adoption of self-driving technology and create confusion among users.",
    "**Public Acceptance and Trust Issues**: Many people may be hesitant to embrace self-driving cars due to fears about safety, reliability, and loss of control. Building public trust is essential for widespread adoption, and companies will need to invest in education and transparency to alleviate concerns and demonstrate the technology's safety and efficacy."
