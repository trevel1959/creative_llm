    "**The Sonic Spires**: Towering, crystalline formations that pierce the sky, emitting a perpetual, pulsating hum. The spires would be created by a unique combination of geological and atmospheric processes, where the Earth's crust and the atmosphere interact to produce a self-sustaining, harmonic vibration. As the spires resonate, they would attract and amplify sound waves, creating an immersive, 3D audio experience.",
