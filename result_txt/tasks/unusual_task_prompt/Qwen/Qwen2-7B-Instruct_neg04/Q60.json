    "**Fashionable Clothing Display System**: Design a clothes hanger system that not only holds clothing but also doubles as an accessory to enhance the display of garments in retail stores or home closets. The hangers can be designed with unique shapes and materials, such as glass, metal, or even wood, each with its own aesthetic appeal. They could also include LED lights to highlight the colors of the clothing or have built-in mirrors for a more interactive experience.",
    "**Ergonomic Workstation Hangers**: Create a series of hangers specifically designed for office use. These hangers can be attached to desks or walls, allowing employees to hang their coats, bags, or accessories without taking up valuable floor space. The hangers could incorporate features like adjustable height settings, hooks for multiple items, and even integrated storage compartments for small personal items.",
    "**Interactive Clothing Sorting Aid**: Develop a hanger that uses RFID (Radio-Frequency Identification) technology to help people sort and organize their clothes based on categories, such as workwear, casual wear, or seasonal items. When clothes are hung on these smart hangers, they communicate with an app on the user's smartphone, displaying information about the item and suggesting outfit combinations or storage locations.",
    "**Recycling and Upcycling Hangers**: Encourage sustainability by creating hangers made from recycled materials, such as reclaimed wood, old plastic bottles, or discarded textiles. These eco-friendly hangers can be used for various purposes, including hanging clothes, jewelry, or even plants. They can also be designed with a modular structure, allowing users to easily customize and rearrange them as needed.",
    "**Smart Hanger for Home Security**: Integrate a motion sensor into a standard clothes hanger to create a simple yet effective home security device. The hanger can detect when an item is removed from it and send an alert to the homeownerâ€™s phone if the item isn't replaced within a certain period. This can help deter theft or unauthorized access to valuable items stored in the closet. The hanger could also double as a coat rack, providing both utility and security in one product."
