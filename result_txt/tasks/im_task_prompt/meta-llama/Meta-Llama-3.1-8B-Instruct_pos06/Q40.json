    "**Augmented Reality Sunglasses with Virtual Try-On**: Develop a pair of smart sunglasses that use AR technology to allow customers to virtually try on different frames, colors, and lenses without physically changing glasses. The user can point their phone's camera at a virtual try-on screen, and the AR software will superimpose a digital version of the sunglasses on their face. This feature would revolutionize the way people shop for eyewear, making it a more engaging and immersive experience.",
    "**Sustainable Sunglasses Made from Recycled Materials**: Design a line of eco-friendly sunglasses made from recycled materials such as recycled plastic, ocean waste, or repurposed metal. The frames could be crafted from a combination of these materials, reducing waste and promoting sustainability. This innovative approach would appeal to environmentally conscious consumers and set a new standard for responsible fashion.",
    "**Smart Sunglasses with Integrated Health Monitoring**: Create a pair of sunglasses that incorporate health monitoring features such as heart rate tracking, blood pressure monitoring, or even glucose level tracking for diabetics. The sunglasses could also include a built-in GPS, accelerometer, and gyroscope to track physical activity, sleep patterns, and other health metrics. This would enable users to monitor their health in a non-intrusive and stylish way.",
    "**Sunglasses with Integrated Virtual Assistants**: Design a pair of sunglasses that integrate virtual assistants like Alexa or Google Assistant, allowing users to control their smart home devices, send messages, or access information hands-free. The sunglasses could also include a built-in speaker or earpiece for voice commands and audio feedback.",
    "**Sunglasses with Integrated Holographic Displays**: Develop a pair of sunglasses that feature holographic displays, allowing users to view 3D holographic images, videos, or even interactive experiences. This could be achieved through the use of micro-LED or laser technology, enabling users to enjoy immersive content in a compact and portable form factor."
