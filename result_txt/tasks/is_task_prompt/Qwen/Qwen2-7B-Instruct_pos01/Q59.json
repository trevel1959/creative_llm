    "**Cloud Adventure Park**: Imagine a theme park where visitors can experience the thrill of being in a cloud. The park could feature rides like \"The Sky Dive\" which simulates jumping from a great height, or \"The Cloud Roller Coaster\" that takes riders on a loop-de-loop through the sky. There could also be an \"Anti-Gravity Maze\" where everything seems to defy gravity, and a \"Cloud Walk\" where visitors walk across a bridge suspended in the clouds. Confidence Score: 0.8",
    "**Cloud Parachute Bungee Jumping**: This innovative idea combines two adrenaline-pumping activities - parachute jumping and bungee jumping. Participants would jump from a plane and then free-fall before deploying their parachute. However, once they reach the ground, instead of landing, they would be attached to a bungee cord and pulled back up into the sky. Confidence Score: 0.7",
    "**Cloud-Only Concerts**: Host concerts exclusively for clouds. Musicians perform while hovering above the audience in the clouds, providing a unique auditory experience with a breathtaking backdrop. To make it even more special, the music might be composed specifically to resonate with the cloud's emotions, potentially influencing their shape and movement. Confidence Score: 0.9",
    "**Cloud-Friendly Sports**: Create sports that can only be played in the clouds. For example, \"Cloud Soccer\", where players use special boots to kick a ball around in the sky, or \"Cloud Basketball\", with hoops suspended high in the air. The rules could include limitations on how high players can jump or the maximum speed they can run at, adding an extra layer of challenge. Confidence Score: 0.85",
    "**Cloud Photography Tours**: Offer guided tours where photographers can capture stunning aerial views of landscapes, cities, or wildlife from the perspective of a cloud. These tours would provide access to areas usually inaccessible, allowing for unique and unparalleled photography opportunities. The guides would be trained to navigate safely within the cloud environment. Confidence Score: 0.75"
