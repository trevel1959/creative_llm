    "**The \"Time Capsule of Change\" Tradition**: Imagine every year, every household or community has to create a time capsule that represents their current state of change. This capsule should include items that symbolize personal growth, environmental conservation, technological advancements, or social progress within the community. For example, it might contain a personal journal from each member, a gadget they've made or improved, or a piece of art that reflects their community's cultural evolution. The capsule is then buried and will be opened in 10 years. This tradition fosters a sense of collective responsibility and encourages continuous improvement.",
