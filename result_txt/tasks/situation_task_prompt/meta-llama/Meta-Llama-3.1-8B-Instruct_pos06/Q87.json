    "**Adaptive Cutting Tools**: Develop a line of cutting tools that adapt to different materials and surfaces. For example, a tool that uses high-pressure water jets to cut through metal, another that uses a heated blade to cut through plastic, and a third that uses a precision saw blade to cut through wood. These tools would be designed to be versatile and efficient, allowing users to cut a wide range of materials without the need for traditional scissors or knives. (Confidence score: 0.9)",
    "**Bio-inspired Cutting Mechanisms**: Study the cutting mechanisms used by nature, such as the way a shark's teeth are designed to cut through flesh, or the way a snail's radula is designed to cut through plant material. Then, develop cutting tools that mimic these mechanisms, using advanced materials and manufacturing techniques to create tools that are both efficient and safe. (Confidence score: 0.8)",
    "**Laser-based Cutting Systems**: Develop a line of laser-based cutting systems that use high-powered lasers to cut through a wide range of materials, from metal to wood to fabric. These systems would be highly accurate and efficient, allowing users to cut complex shapes and designs with ease. (Confidence score: 0.95)",
    "**Shape-memory Alloy Cutting Tools**: Develop cutting tools made from shape-memory alloys that can be heated to change their shape and cut through materials. These tools would be highly versatile and could be used to cut a wide range of materials, from metal to plastic to wood. (Confidence score: 0.85)",
    "**Advanced Composites Cutting Tools**: Develop cutting tools made from advanced composites, such as carbon fiber or Kevlar, that are designed to be extremely durable and resistant to wear. These tools would be able to cut through a wide range of materials, from metal to wood to fabric, and would be highly resistant to damage. (Confidence score: 0.9)"
