    "**Smart Window Technology**: I would utilize smart windows that can adjust their tint and transparency in response to changing temperature and light conditions. These windows would be coated with a thin layer of thermochromic material that changes color and opacity in response to temperature fluctuations. When it's hot outside, the windows would darken to block out sunlight and keep the heat out. Conversely, when it's cold outside, the windows would become transparent to allow sunlight to warm the space. This technology would not only regulate temperature but also reduce energy consumption by minimizing the need for heating and cooling systems. (Confidence Score: 0.9)",
    "**Passive House Design**: I would incorporate passive house design principles into my home's architecture. This involves carefully orienting the building to maximize natural light and heat gain during the winter months, while minimizing heat gain during the summer. The design would also feature thick insulation, airtight construction, and strategically placed windows to maintain a consistent indoor temperature. By harnessing the power of natural ventilation and insulation, I could maintain a comfortable indoor temperature without relying on heating and cooling systems. (Confidence Score: 0.8)",
    "**Phase Change Materials**: I would use phase change materials (PCMs) to regulate indoor temperature. PCMs are substances that absorb and release heat energy as they change phase from solid to liquid or vice versa. By incorporating PCMs into my home's walls, floors, and ceilings, I could store heat energy during the day and release it at night, maintaining a consistent indoor temperature. This would reduce the need for heating and cooling systems, making my home more energy-efficient. (Confidence Score: 0.7)",
    "**Evaporative Cooling**: I would install an evaporative cooling system, which uses water to cool the air through evaporation. This system would work by drawing hot air through a wet pad, causing the water to evaporate and cool the air. This process would not only cool the air but also remove excess humidity, making it an effective solution for regulating indoor temperature. (Confidence Score: 0.6)",
    "**Geothermal Energy Harvesting**: I would incorporate geothermal energy harvesting technology into my home's design. This involves using underground pipes to tap into the Earth's natural temperature, which remains relatively constant throughout the year. By circulating a fluid through these pipes, I could transfer heat from the Earth to my home during the winter or from my home to the Earth during the summer, maintaining a consistent indoor"
