    "Economic fallout: The global economy relies heavily on water for various purposes, including manufacturing, transportation, energy production, and water usage in households and businesses. A shortage of water would lead to a significant decrease in manufacturing processes (e.g., textiles, electronics, and food processing) which rely on water for production. This reduction in production would create job losses and have a ripple effect on global trade.",
    "Dust bowls and desertification: The lack of water would cause the transformation of fertile land regions into dust bowls, rendering them unsuitable for agriculture, thus leading to a mass displacement of populations, economic loss, and an increase in migration-induced conflict.",
    "Political instability: The struggle for water resources would lead to increased tensions between countries and regions, potentially triggering political instability and conflicts. As countries compete for scarce water resources, resource wars or even global conflicts could arise.",
    "Environmental degradation: A shortage of water would exacerbate pollution, as industries and cities would need to find alternatives to water usage to sustain their populations. Using alternative sources of energy, such as fossil fuels, can contribute to environmental degradation and climate change.",
    "Hygiene & public health: A lack of clean water would lead to an increase in waterborne diseases, affecting millions of people, as clean water is essential for personal hygiene and disease prevention. This could lead to a rise in healthcare costs due to the increased burden on healthcare systems and a significant reduction in life expectancy."
