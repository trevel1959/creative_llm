    "**Vision Training Programs**: Communities could establish local vision training programs that teach exercises to improve visual acuity and eye coordination. These programs would focus on techniques such as eye tracking, focusing exercises, and visual memory enhancement. Participants could engage in activities that strengthen their eye muscles and improve their ability to see clearly without corrective lenses.",
    "**Smartphone Vision Assist Apps**: With the proliferation of smartphones, developers could create apps that help people with poor vision navigate their environments. These apps could use the phone's camera to analyze the surroundings and provide audio descriptions, identify objects, or even read text aloud. For example, a person could point their phone at a street sign, and the app would announce the name of the street.",
    "**Vision-Friendly Environments**: Urban planners and architects could design spaces that are more accommodating to individuals with visual impairments. This could include improved lighting, high-contrast color schemes, and tactile pathways that guide individuals through public spaces. Signage would be designed with larger fonts and symbols to ensure visibility, and sound cues could help in navigation.",
    "**Community Support Networks**: People with poor vision could form local support groups that provide assistance in daily tasks. These networks could involve volunteers who offer to help with shopping, transportation, or reading important documents. By fostering a sense of community, individuals would not only receive practical help but also emotional support and companionship.",
    "**Wearable Haptic Feedback Devices**: Innovations in wearable technology could lead to the development of haptic feedback devices that alert users to their surroundings. For example, a wristband could vibrate when a person is near an obstacle or when they need to navigate a turn. This technology would enable users to maintain their independence while safely moving through their environments."
