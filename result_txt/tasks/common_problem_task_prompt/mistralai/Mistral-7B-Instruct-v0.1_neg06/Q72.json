    "\"Creative\" idea: Building a floating solar farm: A floating solar farm is a solar power plant that is built on top of water. It uses specialized panels that areooned to float and can be installed in shallow water bodies. This idea is creative because it utilizes a unique and often underutilized space for solar energy production.",
    "\"Original\" idea: Building a vertical wind turbine farm: A vertical wind turbine farm is a wind power plant that uses tall, vertical wind turbines instead of traditional horizontal wind turbines. This idea is original because it takes advantage of theonics of wind to generate energy in a more efficient way.",
    "\"Creative\" idea: Building a solar thermal power plant: A solar thermal power plant uses mirrors or lenses to focus sunlight onto a fluid that is heated to generate steam. This idea is creative because it uses the sun's energy to heat a fluid, which is then used to generate steam to power a turbine.",
    "\"Original\" idea: Building a geothermal power plant: A geothermal power plant uses the heat from the earth's core to generate electricity. This idea is original because it takes advantage of the earth's natural heat to generate energy.",
    "\"Creative\" idea: Building a tidal energy power plant: A tidal energy power plant uses the kinetic energy of the tides to generate electricity. This idea is creative because it takes advantage of the natural energy of the tides to generate electricity."
