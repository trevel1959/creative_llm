    "**Uncovering Historical Mysteries**: I would harness this ability to gather testimonies from historical figures who are no longer alive. By compelling them to tell the truth about significant events, we could gain insight into pivotal moments in history that remain shrouded in mystery. For example, I could ask Cleopatra about her relationships and political strategies or seek the true reasons behind the fall of the Roman Empire. This knowledge could reshape our understanding of history and influence current educational narratives.",
    "**Resolving Cold Cases**: I would apply this power to cold cases in law enforcement. By making witnesses and suspects tell the truth, we could uncover critical details that have been hidden or misrepresented over the years. This could lead to the resolution of unsolved crimes, providing closure to victims' families and justice to those wronged. The ability to extract the truth could revolutionize forensic investigations and restore faith in the justice system.",
    "**Corporate Transparency**: In the corporate world, I would use this power to ensure complete honesty during shareholder meetings and internal audits. By compelling CEOs and board members to disclose the truth about financial health, ethical practices, and company direction, we could promote accountability and transparency. This could help prevent corporate scandals, encourage ethical behavior, and ultimately lead to a healthier economy where consumers and investors can make informed decisions.",
    "**Personal Relationships**: I would leverage this ability in personal relationships, particularly in situations where trust has been broken. By encouraging partners, friends, or family members to speak the truth about their feelings, intentions, and past actions, we could facilitate healing and understanding. This could lead to stronger bonds, as individuals would be forced to confront their issues honestly, allowing for growth and resolution instead of resentment and misunderstanding.",
    "**Political Accountability**: I would use this power during political campaigns and debates. By ensuring that politicians must tell the truth about their policies, past actions, and campaign promises, voters would be better informed and less susceptible to manipulation. This could lead to a more engaged electorate and ultimately result in a government that is more accountable to its citizens, as elected officials would be unable to hide behind falsehoods."
