    "Create a magnetic levitation system: A magnetic levitation system could be created that allows a magnet to levitate in mid-air. This could be achieved by creating a magnetic field that is strong enough to lift the magnet, and then using a series of magnets to create a stable levitation platform.",
    "Design a magnetic storage device: A magnetic storage device could be created that uses magnets to store and retrieve data. This could be achieved by creating a series of magnets that are arranged in a pattern, and then using a magnetic field to read and write data onto the magnets.",
    "Build a magnetic-powered vehicle: A magnetic-powered vehicle could be created that uses magnets to propel it forward. This could be achieved by creating a series of magnets that are arranged in a pattern, and then using a magnetic field to create a force that propels the vehicle forward.",
    "Create a magnetic-powered robot: A magnetic-powered robot could be created that uses magnets to move and manipulate objects. This could be achieved by creating a series of magnets that are arranged in a pattern, and then using a magnetic field to create a force that moves the robot.",
    "Design a magnetic-powered generator: A magnetic-powered generator could be created that uses magnets to generate electricity. This could be achieved by creating a series of magnets that are arranged in a pattern, and then using a magnetic field to create a force that spins a rotor, which generates electricity."
