    "Greenhouses: Build large greenhouses with transparent roofs that allow sunlight to enter while providing protection from the elements. This would create a controlled environment for growing plants and vegetables, which would provide a source of food even when the sky is cloudy.",
    "Artificial lighting: Create large-scale artificial lighting installations that mimic the sun's rays. These installations could be placed in public spaces or even in private homes, providing a source of light when the natural sunlight is not available.",
    "Cloud-reflecting technology: Develop a way to reflect sunlight back to the Earth's surface using satellites or other means. This could be done by reflecting the sunlight off of mirrors or other reflective surfaces, creating a bright and even light source.",
    "Underwater solar panels: Install solar panels underwater to harness the sunlight that penetrates the water. This could be used to power underwater installations or even to provide electricity to coastal communities.",
    "Solar-powered drones: Develop drones that can fly in the sky and capture sunlight using solar panels. These drones could then be used to deliver electricity to remote areas or to power up devices in areas where sunlight is scarce."
