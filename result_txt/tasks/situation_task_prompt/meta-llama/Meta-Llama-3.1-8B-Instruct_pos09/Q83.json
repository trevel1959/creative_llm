    "**Sleep Pods**: In a world without night-time, humans would need to adapt to a new sleep schedule. I propose the development of sleep pods that can simulate the natural sleep cycle, mimicking the body's natural response to darkness and light. These pods would be designed to induce deep sleep, REM sleep, and even lucid dreaming, ensuring that individuals get the rest they need to function optimally.",
    "**Circadian Rhythm Regulation**: Without night-time, the body's internal clock would need to be regulated artificially. I suggest the creation of wearable devices or implants that can detect and adjust the body's circadian rhythm, ensuring that the individual's sleep patterns remain consistent and healthy. This technology would be especially crucial for individuals who rely on a regular sleep schedule for their work or daily activities.",
    "**Sleep Architecture**: In a world without night-time, buildings and cities would need to be redesigned to accommodate the new sleep patterns. I propose the creation of sleep-friendly architecture, featuring vertically-stacked living spaces, underground habitats, or even floating cities. These structures would be designed to minimize noise pollution, maximize natural light, and provide a comfortable sleep environment.",
    "**Sleep-Inducing Art**: Art has the power to evoke emotions and influence our behavior. In a world without night-time, I suggest the creation of sleep-inducing art forms, such as soundscapes, visual installations, or even scented environments, designed to calm the mind and body, preparing individuals for sleep. This art would be an integral part of the sleep culture, helping people relax and recharge.",
    "**Sleep-Friendly Transportation**: Without night-time, transportation systems would need to be adapted to accommodate the new sleep patterns. I propose the development of sleep-friendly vehicles, such as self-driving cars or trains, that can detect and adjust to the individual's sleep schedule, providing a comfortable and restful journey. These vehicles would be equipped with features like adjustable lighting, temperature control, and even sleep-inducing aromas to ensure a peaceful ride. [/INST] <s>[INST] "
