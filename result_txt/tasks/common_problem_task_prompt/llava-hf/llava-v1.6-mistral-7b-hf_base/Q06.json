    "Radiation Exposure: Mars is bombarded with high levels of radiation from the sun and other sources. Prolonged exposure to this radiation can cause serious health problems, including cancer and radiation sickness. To mitigate this risk, astronauts would need to live in heavily shielded habitats, which would be expensive to build and maintain.",
    "Limited Resources: Mars has limited resources, including water and minerals. This means that any resources that are brought to the planet will need to be carefully managed and conserved. For example, water will need to be extracted from the Martian soil, which is a time-consuming and energy-intensive process.",
    "Extreme Temperatures: Mars has extreme temperature fluctuations, with temperatures that can reach 70 degrees Celsius during the day and -195 degrees Celsius at night. This would make it difficult for humans to live comfortably on the planet, and would require the development of specialized habitats that can regulate temperature.",
    "Gravity: Mars has only 38% of the gravity of Earth, which could cause problems for humans who are not used to living in a low-gravity environment. This could lead to bone and muscle problems, as well as other health issues.",
    "Loneliness and Isolation: Living on Mars would be a lonely and isolating experience, as there is no other planet with human life nearby. This could lead to psychological problems, such as depression and anxiety, and would require the development of strategies to maintain mental health."
