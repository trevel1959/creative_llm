    "**Color-Changing Post-it Notes**: Develop Post-it Notes that change color based on temperature or light exposure. For example, a note left in sunlight could shift from yellow to orange, signaling it has been there too long. This would serve as a visual cue to prioritize or revisit certain notes. Users could also choose specific colors for different categories of tasks, creating a dynamic and engaging organizational system.",
    "**Post-it Note Calendar**: Create a calendar system using Post-it Notes that allows users to write down appointments or tasks for each day and stick them on a wall or board. Each note could be a different color to represent different types of tasks (work, personal, reminders). Users could easily move notes around as schedules change, providing a flexible and interactive way to manage time.",
    "**Eco-Friendly Post-it Notes**: Introduce a line of biodegradable Post-it Notes made from recycled paper and eco-friendly adhesives. These notes could be compostable, appealing to environmentally conscious consumers. Additionally, the packaging could be made from recycled materials, promoting sustainability and reducing waste in the stationery industry.",
    "**Post-it Note with Built-in Tracker**: Design Post-it Notes that come with a small adhesive tracker (like a Tile or similar device) attached to the corner. This would allow users to locate misplaced notes using a smartphone app. Whether itâ€™s a grocery list or a reminder for an important meeting, users could easily find their notes, eliminating frustration and saving time.",
    "**Magnetic Post-it Notes**: Create a line of Post-it Notes with a magnetic backing, allowing them to stick to any metal surface, such as refrigerators, file cabinets, or whiteboards. This would expand the usability of Post-it Notes beyond paper surfaces and create new opportunities for organization in kitchens, offices, and workshops."
