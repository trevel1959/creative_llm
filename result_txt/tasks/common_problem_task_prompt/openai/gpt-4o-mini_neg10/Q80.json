    "**Eco-Conscious Invitations**: Traditional paper invitations can lead to significant waste. Instead, couples can opt for digital invitations or choose recycled paper options. They could also consider seed paper invitations that guests can plant after the wedding. This not only minimizes waste but also adds a unique touch to the wedding experience, allowing guests to contribute to the environment post-celebration.",
    "**Sustainable Catering**: The food served at weddings can have a large environmental impact. Couples should consider catering services that source ingredients locally and prioritize organic or seasonal produce. Additionally, offering a plant-based menu can reduce the carbon footprint associated with meat production. To minimize food waste, couples can work with caterers to create a plan for leftover food, such as donating it to local shelters or composting.",
    "**Eco-Friendly Decor**: Many traditional wedding decorations are made from non-biodegradable materials. Couples can explore alternatives such as renting decor items, using potted plants instead of cut flowers, or incorporating natural elements like wood and stone. Upcycling vintage items or borrowing decor from friends can also add a personal touch while reducing waste. This approach not only supports sustainability but can also lead to a unique and personalized aesthetic.",
    "**Transportation Logistics**: Coordinating transportation for guests can be a logistical challenge, especially if the venue is remote. Couples can encourage carpooling, provide shuttles for guests, or even suggest accommodations nearby to minimize travel emissions. Using electric or hybrid vehicles for the wedding party can also showcase the coupleâ€™s commitment to sustainability.",
    "**Conscious Gifting**: Traditional wedding registries often encourage couples to select numerous items that may not be environmentally friendly. Instead, couples can create a registry focused on experiences, donations to environmental charities, or contributions to eco-friendly home goods. This approach not only aligns with sustainable practices but also encourages guests to think critically about their purchases."
