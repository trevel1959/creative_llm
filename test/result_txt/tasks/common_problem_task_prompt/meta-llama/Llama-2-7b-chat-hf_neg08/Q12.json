The group can also provide practical tips and strategies for managing these feelings and completing tasks in a more timely manner.",
    "Embrace the \"slow and steady wins the race\" philosophy: Rather than trying to compete with others in terms of speed, focus on the quality of your work. Take pride in the attention to detail and care that you put into each task. Remember, slow and steady progress can often lead to greater success in the long run.",
    "Practice mindfulness and self-compassion: When you feel jealous of others' ability to complete tasks quickly, try practicing mindfulness techniques to stay present and focused. Remind yourself that everyone has their own unique pace and way of working. Be kind and compassionate towards yourself, and try to reframe your feelings of jealousy as motivation to do your best.",

    "Celebrate others' successes: Instead of feeling jealous of others' accomplishments, try celebrating their successes. Offer support and encouragement, and acknowledge the hard work and dedication that went into completing their tasks.
