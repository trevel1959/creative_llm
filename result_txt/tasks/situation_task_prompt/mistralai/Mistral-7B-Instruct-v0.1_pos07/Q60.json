    "Barter System: In the absence of currency, people would revert to the barter system, where goods and services are directly exchanged without any medium of exchange. This would require people to be skilled in trading and negotiating, and would also encourage people to produce goods that are in high demand.",
    "Gift Economy: Another possibility is that people would adopt a gift economy, where goods and services are given away freely without any expectation of reciprocation. This would require a shift in societal norms and values, and would require people to be generous and trusting.",
    "Cryptocurrency: In the future, cryptocurrencies could become a popular alternative to traditional currency. These digital currencies are decentralized and secure, and could be used to trade goods and services without the need for intermediaries.",
    "Local Exchange Trading Systems (LETS): LETS are community-based systems that facilitate the exchange of goods and services without the use of money. These systems are often used in small communities, and could become more widespread in the absence of traditional currency.",
    "Commodity-based Trade: In the absence of currency, people could trade goods based on their inherent value, such as food, clothing, and shelter. This would require people to be self-sufficient and resourceful, and would encourage people to produce goods that are essential to survival."
