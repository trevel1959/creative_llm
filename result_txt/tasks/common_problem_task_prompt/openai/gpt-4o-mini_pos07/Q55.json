    "**Funding and Resource Allocation**: Securing sufficient funding for the establishment and ongoing maintenance of the park can be a significant challenge. This may involve competing for grants, donations, or government support. Insufficient funds can lead to inadequate infrastructure, lack of staff for conservation efforts, or failure to implement necessary programs for education and community engagement, which are vital for the park's success.",
    "**Community Engagement and Resistance**: Local communities may have differing opinions about the establishment of a conservation park. Some may view it as a restriction on land use or economic development opportunities, leading to resistance. Engaging with the community through transparent communication and involving them in the planning process is essential. Failing to do so could result in conflicts, protests, or a lack of local support, jeopardizing the park's sustainability.",
    "**Invasive Species Management**: The introduction of invasive species can threaten the native ecosystems within the conservation park. These species can outcompete native flora and fauna, disrupt food chains, and lead to a decline in biodiversity. Developing a comprehensive management plan to monitor and control invasive species is crucial, but this requires ongoing research, funding, and manpower, which may be challenging to maintain.",
    "**Climate Change Impact**: Climate change poses a significant threat to the ecosystems within a nature conservation park. Changes in temperature and precipitation patterns can alter habitats, affect species migration, and lead to increased frequency of extreme weather events. Establishing adaptive management strategies to mitigate these impacts is essential, but this requires expertise and resources that may not always be readily available.",
    "**Visitor Management and Conservation Balance**: Attracting visitors to the conservation park is important for raising awareness and generating revenue, but it can also lead to issues such as habitat degradation, pollution, and disturbance to wildlife. Striking a balance between promoting ecotourism and protecting the park's natural resources is critical. Implementing visitor management strategies, such as designated trails and educational programs, can help mitigate these issues."
