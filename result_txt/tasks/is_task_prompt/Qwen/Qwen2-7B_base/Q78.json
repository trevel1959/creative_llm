The stone glowed with the warmth and light of the sun, and the bear knew she had found the key to her salvation.

One day, she learned that her gift was not unique, and that there were others in her world who could see the sun as well.

Knowing that the sun was her friend, she decided to take the panel with her, hoping that someday she would be able to bring its warmth and light back to her people. The panel became a symbol of hope, and the bear knew that one day, she would be able to share the sun's warmth with all those who had been deprived of it for so long."
