    "Casting challenges: Finding the right actors to fill key roles can be a daunting task. A screenwriter needs to create characters that fit the actors' strengths and are commercially viable. The pressure to cast a well-known actor to attract audiences or finding an actor who resonates with the audience can be challenging.",
    "Balancing originality and commercial appeal: Commercial success is vital for a film. While a screenwriter may want to create a unique and original story, they need to strike a balance between the innovation and the familiar elements that audiences are drawn to. A screenplay should satisfy their artistic vision without sacrificing marketability.",
    "Adapting to the competition: Hollywood churns out new movies daily, creating an intensely competitive environment. A screenwriter needs to be aware of recent trends in films and try to stand out from the crowd. This could involve creating a new genre, combining genres, or creating a story that transcends the common formulas.",
    "Script changes and rewrites: No matter how well a screenwriter thinks through a project, there is always a chance that changes will be made. This could be due to production constraints, studio notes, or even the actor's availability. The ability to adapt to these changes while maintaining artistic integrity is a major challenge.",
    "Realistic dialogue: Dialogue is an essential element of a screenplay. A screenwriter should create realistic dialogue that sounds natural, fits the characters, and propels the story forward. Incorporating authenticity and nuance into the dialogue can contribute greatly to the overall tone and believability of the film."
