    "Wear a Solar-Powered Hat: Design a hat that harnesses the power of the sun to generate a cooling mist to protect the head from sunburn. This innovative hat could be made of a lightweight, breathable material with built-in solar panels that absorb sunlight and convert it into energy. When the wearer feels the hat getting too hot, the mist is released to provide a refreshing and cooling sensation.",
    "Apply a Sunburn-Repelling Spray: Develop a spray that contains a special blend of natural ingredients that repel the sun's rays, preventing sunburn from occurring. This spray could be made from a combination of herbs and plants that have natural sun-protective properties, such as aloe vera, chamomile, and green tea. The spray could be applied to the scalp and hair to provide long-lasting protection from the sun.",
    "Use a Sun-Sensing Scarf: Create a scarf that can detect the intensity of the sun's rays and adjust its thickness accordingly. This smart scarf could be made of a special fabric that contains sensors that monitor the UV radiation levels and release a cooling mist when the sun's rays become too strong. This would provide a cooling and protective barrier against sunburn.",
    "Develop a Solar-Powered Sunscreen: Invent a sunscreen that is powered by the sun and provides continuous protection from UV rays. This innovative sunscreen could be made of a special formula that contains photovoltaic cells that convert sunlight into energy, which is then used to power a built-in fan that blows cool air onto the skin. This would provide a constant cooling effect and prevent sunburn from occurring.",
    "Wear a Solar-Powered Turban: Design a turban that harnesses the power of the sun to provide a cooling and protective barrier against sunburn. This innovative turban could be made of a special fabric that contains built-in solar panels that absorb sunlight and convert it into energy. The energy could be used to power a built-in fan that blows cool air onto the head, providing a refreshing and cooling sensation. Additionally, the turban could be designed with special sections"
