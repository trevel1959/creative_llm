    "Build a giant floating island: One solution to cross a large body of water without ships or boats is to build a giant floating island. The island can be made of lightweight materials such as foam or air-filled structures, and can be designed to float on the water. Once built, people can use the island to cross the water by simply walking or swimming from one island to another.",
    "Use a submarine: Another solution is to use a submarine to cross the water. Submarines are designed to withstand the pressure of water and can be used to travel deep underwater. People can use a submarine to cross the water by diving down to the bottom of the ocean and then swimming up to the surface on the other side.",
    "Build a bridge: A bridge can be built across the water to connect two points on opposite sides. The bridge can be made of materials such as steel or concrete and can be designed to withstand the pressure of water. People can use the bridge to cross the water by walking or driving across it.",
    "Use a jet ski: A jet ski can be used to cross the water by driving across the surface. Jet skis are designed to be fast and can be used to travel long distances quickly. People can use a jet ski to cross the water by driving from one side to the other.",
    "Build a water wheel: A water wheel can be built to transport people across the water. The water wheel can be designed to float on the water and can be used to transport people from one side to the other. People can use the water wheel to cross the water by sitting on it and being pulled across the water by a rope or cable."
