    "**ECHO - Empowering Creative Hands and Outcomes**: ECHO is a wearable, AI-powered smart glove that utilizes 3D mapping and haptic feedback to create a tactile representation of visual information. The glove can recognize objects, people, and environments, and translate this data into a series of vibrations and pressure points on the user's hand. This allows the visually impaired to navigate their surroundings with greater ease and independence.",
    "**Sonic Skies**: Sonic Skies is an immersive audio experience that utilizes sound waves to create a 3D map of the user's surroundings. By leveraging the Doppler effect and audio processing algorithms, the technology can detect and translate visual cues into an audio representation, allowing the visually impaired to perceive their environment through sound. This can be particularly useful for navigation and spatial awareness.",
    "**EyeSee**: EyeSee is a non-invasive, wearable device that uses electroencephalography (EEG) to detect and decode brain activity related to visual perception. By analyzing the user's brain signals, EyeSee can generate a visual representation of the user's surroundings, effectively \"seeing\" for them. This technology has the potential to revolutionize the way we interact with the world around us.",
    "**Tactile Tapestry**: Tactile Tapestry is a smart, fabric-based display that uses electroactive polymers (EAPs) to create a dynamic, tactile representation of visual information. The EAPs can change shape and texture in response to visual data, allowing the visually impaired to explore and interact with digital content through touch. This technology has the potential to create new forms of accessible media and art.",
    "**Voxio**: Voxio is a voice-controlled, AI-powered platform that utilizes computer vision and machine learning to create a personalized, audio-based representation of the user's surroundings. By analyzing visual data from cameras and sensors, Voxio can generate a descriptive audio narrative of the user's environment, including objects, people, and events. This technology has the potential to enhance the daily lives of the visually impaired, providing them with greater independence and confidence. [/INST] "
