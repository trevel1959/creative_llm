    "Create Customized Pencils: Use a pencil sharpener to create unique shapes, sizes, and textures in pencils. For example, you could sharpen one end of a pencil into a fine point for calligraphy, or the other end into a chunky shape for easier grip. This could also include creating a spiral pattern around the pencil for a decorative touch.",
    "Decorative Paper Edges: After sharpening a pencil, use the shaved-off shavings to decorate the edges of papers, such as wrapping paper, greeting cards, or scrapbooking pages. The shavings can be arranged in patterns or glued onto the paper to create a textured look.",
    "Jewelry Making: Utilize the small, sharp pieces from a pencil sharpener to create intricate jewelry designs. These pieces can be strung together, soldered, or combined with other materials to make pendants, earrings, or bracelets. This idea combines the functionality of a pencil sharpener with artistic creativity in jewelry making.",
    "Textile Design: Use the pencil shavings as a natural dye for fabric. Soak the shavings in water, then apply the dye to various textiles. The color will vary depending on the type of pencil used, offering a range of hues. This technique adds an eco-friendly element to textile design while still being unconventional.",
    "Garden Mulch: Collect the pencil shavings and use them as mulch in your garden beds. The shavings will slowly decompose, enriching the soil and suppressing weeds. This environmentally friendly alternative to traditional mulching materials adds a creative twist to gardening practices."
