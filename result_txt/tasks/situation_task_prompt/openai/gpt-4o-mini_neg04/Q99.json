    "**Shape and Silhouette Recognition**: Create a system that emphasizes the importance of shapes and silhouettes. Objects could be designed or categorized based on their outlines and geometric forms. For instance, a triangular prism could represent a pyramid, while a round object could signify a ball. In this world, art and design would focus on creating striking shapes that are easily identifiable.",
    "**Sound Identification**: Introduce a system of sound differentiation, where each object emits a unique sound when interacted with or moved. For example, a glass bottle might produce a high-pitched tinkling sound, while a wooden box could create a dull thud. This auditory cue would allow individuals to identify objects by their acoustic properties, leading to a world where sound plays a central role in object recognition.",
    "**Patterns and Markings**: Encourage the use of patterns, symbols, or markings on objects to convey information. For instance, different types of furniture could have distinct patterns etched into their surfacesâ€”stripes for chairs, dots for tables, etc. This would create a visual language that transcends color, allowing individuals to recognize and categorize objects based on their designs.",
    "**Size and Proportion**: Focus on the physical dimensions of objects. A system could be developed where objects are categorized by their size, height, width, and volume. For example, a small, cube-shaped box could represent a specific item, while a large, rectangular object could represent something else entirely. This could also lead to innovative design approaches that prioritize functionality based on size.",
    "**Temperature Variation**: Explore the concept of thermal properties as a means of identification. Different materials can retain heat differently, so objects could be categorized based on their temperature when touched. For instance, metal objects might feel colder to the touch, while fabric items could feel warm. This sensory experience would add a layer of interaction that aids in object recognition."
