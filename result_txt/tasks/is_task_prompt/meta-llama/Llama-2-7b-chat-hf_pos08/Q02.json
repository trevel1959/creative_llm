Each workshop could focus on a different aspect of personal development, such as mindfulness, resilience, or creativity, and provide practical tools and techniques for overcoming obstacles and achieving success.",
    "Develop a mobile app that uses augmented reality to create a virtual river that flows backward. Users can follow the river's path and interact with virtual objects and obstacles, such as rocks, waterfalls, and rapids, to simulate the experience of swimming against the current. The app could also include challenges and mini-games that test users' problem-solving skills and creativity.",
