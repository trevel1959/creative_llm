    "**Bartering Guilds**: Establish a network of local bartering guilds where individuals can exchange goods and services directly. Each guild would have a system for tracking transactions, ensuring fairness, and preventing exploitation. Members could trade items like food, tools, shelter, and skills, fostering a sense of community and cooperation.",
    "**Skill-Based Exchange**: Develop a system where people trade skills and services rather than physical goods. For example, a person with expertise in cooking could trade meals for a week in exchange for a person's skills in repair work or childcare. This would encourage people to develop new skills and promote mutual support.",
    "**Time Banking**: Implement a time banking system where individuals exchange time and skills rather than money. For every hour of work or service provided, a person would receive a certain number of time credits, which could be redeemed for services from others. This would encourage people to contribute their skills and time to the community.",
    "**Resource-Based Economy**: Establish a resource-based economy where goods and services are provided based on availability and need. Resources like food, water, shelter, and energy would be allocated based on a person's requirements, rather than their ability to pay. This would ensure that everyone's basic needs are met, and resources are used efficiently.",
    "**Experience-Based Economy**: Create an economy where people trade experiences and memories rather than physical goods. For example, a person could trade a week-long adventure in exchange for a cooking class or a art lesson. This would encourage people to focus on creating experiences and memories, rather than accumulating material possessions.
