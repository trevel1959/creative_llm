    "**Eco-Friendly Venue**: Choose a venue that is already environmentally friendly, such as a historic barn, a vineyard, or a botanical garden. These venues often have existing infrastructure that minimizes waste and reduces carbon footprint. Consider renting a venue that has implemented sustainable practices, such as solar panels, rainwater harvesting, or composting toilets.",
    "**Zero-Waste Menu**: Work with a catering company that specializes in zero-waste cuisine. This can be achieved by using locally sourced ingredients, composting food waste, and serving dishes that are designed to be eaten in one bite, reducing the need for utensils and plates. Consider a family-style service where food is served in large bowls, reducing the number of individual plates and utensils needed.",
    "**Sustainable Decor**: Opt for decorations that are biodegradable, reusable, or repurposed. Use flowers, branches, and greenery to create beautiful centerpieces and arrangements. Consider renting or repurposing items such as vintage china, linens, and glassware. Avoid single-use plastics and opt for candles made from soy or beeswax instead of paraffin wax.",
    "**Carbon Offset**: Calculate the carbon footprint of your wedding and offset it by investing in renewable energy projects or reforestation programs. You can also consider partnering with a charity that supports environmental causes. This will not only reduce your carbon footprint but also contribute to a good cause.",
    "**Second-Hand Wedding Dress**: Consider renting or buying a second-hand wedding dress. Many online marketplaces and local consignment stores offer a wide range of pre-owned wedding dresses at a fraction of the cost of a new dress. This not only reduces waste but also supports sustainable fashion practices."
