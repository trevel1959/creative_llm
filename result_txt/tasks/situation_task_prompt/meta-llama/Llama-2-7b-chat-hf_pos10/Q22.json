    "Waterways: If all roads disappeared, people could use waterways such as rivers, lakes, and canals as a means of transportation. This could involve building boats or ships to travel on the water, or even creating a network of canals and locks to navigate through the town or city. This option would provide a unique and sustainable way of moving around, while also preserving the natural beauty of the area.",
    "Airships: Another option would be to use airships to travel around the town or city. Airships are a type of hybrid aircraft that use both lift bags and engines to fly, and they could be used to transport people and goods. This option would provide a slow but comfortable way of traveling, and it would also be a sustainable option as it would produce less emissions than traditional aircraft.",
    "Maglev Trains: Maglev trains use magnetic levitation to move without touching the tracks, reducing friction and increasing speed. These trains could be used to move around the town or city quickly and efficiently, while also providing a smooth and comfortable ride. This option would be a more sustainable way of transportation compared to traditional trains, as it would reduce the amount of energy required to move the trains.",
    "Personal Flight Devices: Personal flight devices, such as hoverboards or jetpacks, could be used to move around the town or city. These devices would allow individuals to travel short distances quickly and easily, while also providing a unique and exciting way of experiencing the city. This option would be a fun and sustainable way of transportation, as it would produce no emissions and would not require any infrastructure.",
    "Network of Tunnels: A network of tunnels could be built underneath the town or city, providing a safe and efficient way of moving around. This option would involve building a series of tunnels that connect different parts of the town or city, allowing people to travel quickly and easily without having to use the roads. This option would be a sustainable way of transportation, as it would reduce the amount of traffic on the roads and would also provide a safe and secure way of moving around."
