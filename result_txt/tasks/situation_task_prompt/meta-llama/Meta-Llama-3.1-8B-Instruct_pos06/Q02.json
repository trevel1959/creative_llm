    "**Community Gardens and Food Cooperatives**: With supermarkets gone, community gardens and food cooperatives would become the primary sources of fresh produce. These cooperatives would be owned and managed by the community, ensuring equitable access to healthy food. Members would contribute labor, expertise, and resources to maintain the gardens and distribute the produce. This model would promote social connections, skill-sharing, and a sense of community, while providing a reliable food supply. (Confidence score: 0.9)",
    "**Urban Agriculture and Rooftop Gardens**: Cities would transform into vast gardens, with rooftops, balconies, and backyards converted into productive spaces. Residents would grow their own fruits, vegetables, and herbs, using hydroponics, aeroponics, or traditional soil-based methods. This would not only provide a steady food supply but also help mitigate urban heat islands and improve air quality. Neighborhoods would become hubs for knowledge-sharing, with residents exchanging tips and techniques. (Confidence score: 0.85)",
    "**Foraging and Wild Food Gathering**: As supermarkets disappear, people would turn to foraging and wild food gathering to supplement their diets. This would involve learning about local flora, identifying edible plants, and harvesting them sustainably. Communities would develop guidelines for responsible foraging, ensuring that the practice is done in a way that preserves ecosystems and doesn't harm the environment. This approach would foster a deeper connection with nature and promote a culture of self-sufficiency. (Confidence score: 0.8)",
    "**Mobile Markets and Food Vendors**: In the absence of supermarkets, mobile markets and food vendors would become the norm. These vendors would travel to different neighborhoods, selling fresh produce, meats, and other essentials. This would create a vibrant street food culture, with vendors competing to offer the best products and services. Mobile markets would also provide opportunities for small-scale farmers and artisans to reach customers directly, promoting local economies and community engagement. (Confidence score: 0.9)",
    "**Aquaponics and Aquaculture**: As a reliable source of protein, aquaponics and aquaculture would become increasingly important. These systems would integrate fish and plant farming, using waste from one to nourish the other. Communities would establish aquaponic farms, providing a sustainable source of fresh fish, fruits, and vegetables. This approach would not only ensure food security but also promote eco-friendly practices and create new economic opportunities. (Confidence score: 0.8)"
