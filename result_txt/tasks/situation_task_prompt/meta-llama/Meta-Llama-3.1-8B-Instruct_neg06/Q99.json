    "**Infrared Vision Goggles**: Develop wearable Infrared (IR) vision goggles that can detect temperature differences between objects. This would allow people to differentiate between objects based on their thermal signatures. For example, a warm object like a stove or a cup of coffee would appear brighter than a cold object like a metal surface or a glass of ice water.",
    "**Eco-Friendly Dye Alternatives**: Create a line of eco-friendly dyes that can be used to color objects. These dyes could be made from natural sources like plants, minerals, or even recycled materials. This would allow people to differentiate between objects based on their unique color profiles.",
    "**Haptic Feedback Technology**: Develop a wearable device that uses haptic feedback technology to provide tactile sensations based on the object's texture, shape, and material. This would allow people to differentiate between objects based on their tactile properties.",
    "**Sound-Based Differentiation**: Create a system that uses sound waves to differentiate between objects. For example, a device could emit a unique sound frequency based on the object's material composition or shape. This would allow people to identify objects based on their distinct sonic signatures.",
    "**Bioluminescent Markers**: Develop bioluminescent markers that can be applied to objects to create a unique glow. These markers could be based on microorganisms or chemical reactions that emit light when exposed to specific conditions. This would allow people to differentiate between objects based on their glowing properties."
