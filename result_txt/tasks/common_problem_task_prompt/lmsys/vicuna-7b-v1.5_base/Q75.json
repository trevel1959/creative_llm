    "Overcrowding and overuse of resources: National parks are popular destinations for tourists, which can lead to overcrowding and overuse of resources such as water and food. This can lead to degradation of the environment and a negative impact on wildlife.",
    "Preservation of cultural and historical sites: National parks often contain important cultural and historical sites, such as ancient ruins or Native American reservations. Preserving these sites while also allowing visitors to access them can be a challenge, as visitors may accidentally damage or destroy these sites.",
    "Balancing conservation and recreation: National parks are meant to be both conservation areas and recreational areas. Balancing the need for conservation with the need for recreation can be difficult, as activities such as hiking and camping can have negative impacts on the environment.",
    "Managing wildlife: National parks are home to a wide variety of wildlife, and managing their populations and behavior can be a challenge. Wildlife may become accustomed to human presence and become a danger to visitors, or they may become endangered due to habitat loss or other factors.",
    "Ensuring public safety: National parks can be dangerous places, and managers must ensure that visitors are safe while still allowing them to enjoy the park. This can be a challenge, as visitors may engage in risky behavior such as hiking off-trail or swimming in dangerous areas."
