    "Solar-Powered Lanterns: I would use solar-powered lanterns to provide light during the day. These lanterns use solar panels to convert sunlight into electricity, which can be stored in batteries for later use. I would purchase or create DIY solar-powered lanterns to ensure a reliable source of light. Confidence Score: 0.8",
    "Mirror-Based Reflective Lighting: I would use mirrors to reflect sunlight indoors during the day. By positioning mirrors strategically, I can redirect sunlight from outside into rooms without the need for artificial lighting. This method would be especially effective in rooms with large windows. Confidence Score: 0.9",
    "Light-Emitting Plants: I would use plants that emit light to provide illumination during the day. These plants, such as glowing mushrooms or plants with bioluminescent properties, can provide a soft, natural light that can fill a room. I would research and gather these plants to create a lighting system. Confidence Score: 0.8",
    "Sky-Gazing Dome: I would create a sky-gazing dome to view the sun during the day. By creating a dome with a transparent surface, I can observe the sun indirectly without exposing myself to harmful UV rays. This would provide a unique and fascinating way to experience the sun during the day. Confidence Score: 0.7",
    "Light-Reflecting Window Film: I would use light-reflecting window film to increase the amount of natural light entering a room. This film can reflect up to 70% of the sun's light, providing additional illumination during the day. This method would be particularly effective in rooms with large windows but limited natural light. Confidence Score: 0.6"
