    "Voice Assistance: Integrate voice recognition technology into the electric toothbrush, allowing users to control its settings and functions using voice commands. This would make it more accessible for individuals with limited mobility or those who struggle with manual dexterity.",
    "Customizable Brush Heads: Offer a range of brush heads with different bristle textures, stiffness, and sizes to cater to various user preferences and specific oral care needs (e.g., sensitive teeth, gum care, whitening). Users can choose and switch between brush heads based on their current dental concerns.",
    "UV-C Sanitization: Incorporate a UV-C light inside the toothbrush's storage case or charging base to sanitize the brush head after each use, ensuring better hygiene and reducing the risk of bacteria buildup.",
    "Adaptive Pressure Sensor: Implement a pressure sensor that detects excessive brushing force and gently vibrates or beeps to remind the user to reduce pressure. This feature can help prevent gum damage and tooth enamel erosion caused by aggressive brushing.",
    "Wireless Charging: Use a Qi-compatible wireless charging system in the toothbrush, making it easy for users to charge the device without needing to connect it to a power source. This would provide a convenient and hassle-free charging experience."
