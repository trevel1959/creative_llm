    "**Self-Cleaning Filter System**: Introduce a self-cleaning mechanism for the vacuum's filters. This could involve a small built-in brush that automatically brushes off dust and debris from the filter after each use. This innovation would not only maintain suction power but also reduce the frequency of manual filter cleaning, making the vacuum more user-friendly.",
    "**Eco-Friendly Material and Design**: Develop a vacuum cleaner made from biodegradable materials or recycled plastics. Additionally, it could feature an energy-efficient motor that uses less electricity while maintaining powerful suction. This design would appeal to environmentally conscious consumers and reduce the ecological footprint of household cleaning appliances.",
    "**Integrated Air Purifier**: Combine the vacuum cleaner with an air purification system. As the vacuum cleans floors, it could simultaneously filter and purify the air in the room, capturing allergens, dust, and pet dander. This dual-functionality would make it a two-in-one appliance, improving indoor air quality while cleaning.",
    "**Modular Attachments for Versatile Cleaning**: Create a modular vacuum cleaner system with interchangeable attachments for various cleaning tasks. For example, users could switch from a carpet brush to a hard floor nozzle, or even to specialized tools for cleaning upholstery or car interiors. This adaptability would make the vacuum cleaner more versatile and efficient for different surfaces and cleaning needs.",
    "**Augmented Reality Cleaning Guide**: Implement augmented reality (AR) technology that guides users through the cleaning process. By using a smartphone or AR glasses, users could see visual overlays showing the best cleaning paths, highlighting areas that need more attention, or even providing maintenance tips. This feature would enhance user engagement and make the cleaning process more efficient."
