    "**DNA Testing**: DNA testing is a highly accurate method of identifying a person. If all other forms of identification disappear, DNA testing could be used to confirm a person's identity. A DNA sample could be taken and compared to a database of known DNA profiles to confirm identity.",
    "**Behavioral Biometrics**: Behavioral biometrics involves analyzing a person's behavioral patterns, such as their gait, typing speed, and mouse movements, to create a unique profile. This could be used to prove a person's identity, as it is difficult to mimic these patterns.",
    "**Retinal Scanning**: Retinal scanning involves scanning the unique patterns of the blood vessels in a person's eye. This is a highly accurate form of identification that is difficult to fake or forge.",
    "**Voice Recognition**: Voice recognition technology can be used to identify a person based on the unique patterns of their voice. This could be used to prove identity by speaking into a voice recognition system.",
    "**Brain Implant Identification**: In the future, brain implants could be used to store a person's identity. The implant could be scanned or read to confirm a person's identity."
