    "Limited resources: Organic farming often requires more labor and resources than conventional farming. The individuals setting up the farm may not have access to the necessary resources, such as land, water, and equipment.",
    "Weather conditions: Unpredictable weather conditions can have a significant impact on crop growth and yield. Droughts, floods, and extreme temperatures can all negatively affect the health and productivity of the crops.",
    "Pests and diseases: Organic farming relies on natural methods to control pests and diseases, which can be less effective than chemical pesticides. This can lead to higher crop losses and a greater need for labor-intensive manual intervention.",
    "Market demand: There may be a lack of demand for organic produce in the local market, making it difficult for the farm to sell its products and generate revenue.",
    "Regulations and certifications: Organic farming must adhere to strict regulations and standards to maintain organic certification. Failure to comply with these regulations can result in the loss of certification and the inability to sell organic products."
