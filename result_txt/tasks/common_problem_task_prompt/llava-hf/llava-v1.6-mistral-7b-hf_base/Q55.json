    "Poaching and Illegal Hunting: The establishment of a nature conservation park may attract poachers and illegal hunters who may target protected species for their meat, hides, or other body parts. This can lead to a decline in the population of the targeted species and disrupt the balance of the ecosystem. To address this issue, the park authorities should implement strict regulations and enforcement measures to deter poaching and illegal hunting, such as increasing patrols, establishing buffer zones, and working with local communities to raise awareness about the importance of conservation.",
    "Human-Wildlife Conflict: As the park expands and human settlements encroach on the park's boundaries, there is an increased risk of human-wildlife conflict. This can lead to damage to crops, property, and even human casualties. To mitigate this issue, the park authorities should implement measures to reduce human-wildlife conflict, such as constructing fences, creating early warning systems, and working with local communities to promote coexistence and understanding.",
    "Invasive Species: The introduction of non-native species to the park can disrupt the local ecosystem and threaten native species. These invasive species can outcompete or prey on native species, leading to a decline in biodiversity. To address this issue, the park authorities should implement measures to prevent the introduction of invasive species, such as monitoring the park's boundaries, conducting regular surveys, and implementing early detection and rapid response measures.",
    "Climate Change: Climate change can have a significant impact on the park's ecosystem, leading to changes in vegetation, water availability, and wildlife behavior. To address this issue, the park authorities should implement measures to adapt to climate change, such as restoring wetlands, implementing water conservation measures, and monitoring changes in wildlife behavior and migration patterns.",
    "Funding and Sustainability: Establishing and maintaining a nature conservation park can be expensive, and finding sustainable funding sources can be a challenge. To address this issue, the park authorities should explore a range of funding options, such as government funding, private donations, and eco-tourism. They should also implement measures to ensure the park's long-term sustainability, such as developing partnerships with local communities and businesses, and promoting responsible tourism practices."
