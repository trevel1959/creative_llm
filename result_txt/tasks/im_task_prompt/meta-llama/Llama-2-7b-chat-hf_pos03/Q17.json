    "Smart Wash: This idea is a washing machine that can detect the type of fabric it is washing and adjust its washing cycle, water temperature, and spin speed accordingly. It can also automatically detect the amount of detergent needed and dispense the right amount. This feature can save time, energy, and money by optimizing the washing process.",
    "Virtual Dry Cleaning: This idea is a washing machine that uses virtual reality technology to simulate the dry cleaning process. Users can upload their clothes to the virtual dry cleaner, which will then use VR to create a virtual replica of the garment. The virtual dry cleaner will then use VR to simulate the cleaning process, including stain removal and pressing. Users can monitor the process in real-time and receive updates on the status of their clothes.",
    "Interactive Washing Machine: This idea is a washing machine that uses sensors and AI to detect when a load of laundry is placed inside and automatically adjusts its washing cycle, water temperature, and spin speed based on the type of fabric being washed. It can also detect when a load is finished and automatically drain the water. This feature can save time and energy by optimizing the washing process.",
    "Clothing Recognition: This idea is a washing machine that uses AI and computer vision to recognize the type of clothing being washed and automatically adjust its washing cycle, water temperature, and spin speed. It can also detect when a load is finished and automatically drain the water. This feature can save time and energy by optimizing the washing process.",
    "Washing Machine with Built-in Dryer: This idea is a washing machine that has a built-in dryer. Users can wash and dry their clothes in one machine, saving time and space. The built-in dryer can also use less energy than a traditional standalone dryer, making it more energy-efficient."
