    "**Water-Based Solutions**: Develop a system of using pure water for cleaning, combined with natural abrasives like sand or pumice stones. Create a network of public water filtration systems to ensure access to clean water. Utilize water-based cleaning products like soap made from natural oils, or even use baking soda and vinegar as cleaning agents.",
    "**Community Cleaning Cooperatives**: Establish community-led cleaning cooperatives where members share knowledge, resources, and labor to maintain hygiene. These cooperatives could provide training on effective cleaning techniques, and develop local cleaning products using natural ingredients. This approach fosters a sense of community and promotes a culture of cleanliness.",
    "**Innovative Materials**: Research and develop new materials that can be used for cleaning, such as biodegradable sponges or scrubbers made from plant-based fibers. Create a network of local manufacturers to produce these materials, reducing reliance on external suppliers. This approach would encourage innovation and self-sufficiency in cleaning solutions.",
    "**Education and Awareness**: Launch a comprehensive education program to teach people about the importance of hygiene and effective cleaning techniques. Develop public awareness campaigns to promote good hygiene practices, and provide resources for individuals to learn about natural cleaning products and methods. This approach would focus on changing behaviors and promoting a culture of cleanliness.",
    "**Urban Agriculture and Waste Management**: Implement urban agriculture initiatives to grow plants that can be used for cleaning products, such as soap-making plants like olive trees or coconut trees. Develop a system for managing waste, including composting and recycling, to reduce the amount of waste that needs to be cleaned. This approach would promote sustainability and reduce the environmental impact of cleaning practices.
