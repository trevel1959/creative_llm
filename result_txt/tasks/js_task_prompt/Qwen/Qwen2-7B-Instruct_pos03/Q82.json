    "**Floral Solar Power Generators:** This plant would possess photovoltaic cells within its petals and leaves that allow it to harness solar energy. The petals would open and close throughout the day to maximize exposure to sunlight, converting it into electrical power which could be harvested by attaching a small battery or connected to an external power system.",
    "**Bio-Resonance Healing Plant:** This plant would be designed to emit specific frequencies of light and sound that can resonate with human bio-rhythms. It would produce a gentle glow that could help reduce stress, improve sleep quality, and potentially aid in the treatment of certain mental health conditions. The plant could also incorporate micro-organisms that produce essential vitamins or other beneficial compounds.",
    "**Water Purification Algae:** A new species of algae capable of filtering out pollutants from water sources. This plant would grow in aquatic environments and utilize specialized enzymes to break down toxins, bacteria, and other contaminants, effectively purifying the water as it grows. Its structure would allow for easy filtration and collection of clean water.",
    "**Growth Accelerator Fungi:** This plant would be a type of fungi that accelerates the growth of other plants when it's in close proximity. It would secrete a substance that stimulates root development and nutrient absorption in nearby vegetation, making it an excellent companion for farmers and gardeners looking to boost crop yields.",
    "**Autonomous Food-producing Trees:** These trees would be equipped with a variety of self-sustaining systems to produce food, oxygen, and even water. They might include solar panels for energy, small hydroponic systems for growing vegetables and fruits, and perhaps even a mini-ecosystem within their roots to recycle nutrients and manage waste. Their design would aim to provide a sustainable source of resources in areas where traditional agriculture is challenging or impossible."
