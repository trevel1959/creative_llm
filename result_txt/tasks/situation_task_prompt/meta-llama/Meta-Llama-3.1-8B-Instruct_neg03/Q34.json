    "**Atmospheric Water Harvesting**: I'd install an atmospheric water harvesting system, which uses condensation to collect water from the air. This method is particularly effective in humid climates and can produce up to 4 liters of water per day per square meter.",
    "**Rainwater Storage in Under-Ground Tanks**: I'd construct underground tanks to store rainwater during periods of precipitation. This would allow me to collect and store water for extended periods, reducing the need for alternative water sources.",
    "**Grey Water Recycling**: I'd implement a grey water recycling system, which collects and treats wastewater from sinks, showers, and washing machines. This water can then be reused for irrigation, reducing the demand on potable water supplies.",
    "**Mist-Based Irrigation System**: I'd design a mist-based irrigation system, which uses a network of fine nozzles to deliver water droplets directly to the plants' roots. This method is highly efficient, as it reduces evaporation and runoff.",
    "**Hydroponic Systems**: I'd adopt hydroponic systems, which use nutrient-rich water rather than soil to grow plants. This method allows for precise control over water usage, reducing waste and minimizing the need for external water sources."
