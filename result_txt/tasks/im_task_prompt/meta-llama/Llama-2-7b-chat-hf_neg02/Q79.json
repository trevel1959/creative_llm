    "Smart Clothes Hanger: Create a clothes hanger with sensors that can detect when an item of clothing is placed on or removed from the hanger. This hanger can then send notifications to a user's phone or smart home system, allowing them to keep track of their wardrobe and receive reminders when items are wrinkled or need to be ironed.",
    "Personalized Clothes Hanger: Design a clothes hanger that can recognize and suggest outfits based on a user's preferences and lifestyle. For example, the hanger could suggest a workout outfit for a gym session or a casual outfit for a weekend hike. This hanger can also provide personalized fashion advice and make recommendations based on a user's past purchases and preferences.",
    "Aromatic Clothes Hanger: Create a clothes hanger that releases a pleasant scent as clothes are hung on it. This hanger can be filled with fragrances like lavender or eucalyptus, which are known to promote relaxation and reduce stress. This can be especially helpful for people who have a hard time getting dressed in the morning due to anxiety or depression.",
    "Motion-Activated Clothes Hanger: Design a clothes hanger that can move around and adjust itself to accommodate different types of clothing. For example, the hanger can move closer to the mirror for dress shirts and pants, and further away for t-shirts and jeans. This can save time and effort when getting dressed, as the hanger can automatically position the clothes in the most convenient spot.",
    "Virtual Clothes Hanger: Create a virtual clothes hanger that allows users to try on clothes virtually. Using augmented reality technology, users can see how different outfits would look on them without having to physically try them on. This can be especially helpful for people who are shopping online or who are unsure about their body shape and size. The virtual hanger can also provide personalized styling advice and make recommendations based on a user's preferences and body type."
