    "Smart Sorting System: Create a laundry basket with a built-in sorting system that categorizes clothes based on their fabric type, color, and size. This basket would have separate compartments with different labels and colors to indicate the type of clothing that can be placed in each one. This would make it easier to separate clothes into different loads and prevent colors from bleeding or getting damaged during the washing process.",
    "Self-Stirring Basket: Design a laundry basket with a built-in stirring mechanism that agitates the clothes during the washing process. This would help to distribute detergent and water more evenly, reducing the risk of under or over-washing clothes. The stirring mechanism could be powered by a small motor or a rubber band, and could be adjusted to suit different washing loads.",
    "Scented Basket: Create a laundry basket with a built-in fragrance dispenser that releases a pleasant scent during the washing process. This could be achieved through the use of essential oils or scented detergent pods. The scent could be adjusted to suit individual preferences, and the dispenser could be refilled or replaced as needed.",
    "Temperature Control Basket: Design a laundry basket with a built-in temperature control system that allows users to adjust the washing temperature to suit different types of clothes. This could be achieved through the use of temperature-sensitive materials or a small heating element that can be adjusted using a button or touch sensor. This would help to prevent damage to delicate or sensitive clothes, and ensure that clothes are washed at the right temperature for optimal cleaning.",
    "Multi-Functional Basket: Create a laundry basket that serves multiple purposes. For example, it could have a built-in ironing board or a detachable hanger for hanging clothes to dry. It could also have a small storage compartment for storing laundry detergent or other laundry supplies. This would make it more convenient for users to do their laundry, as they would have everything they need in one place."
