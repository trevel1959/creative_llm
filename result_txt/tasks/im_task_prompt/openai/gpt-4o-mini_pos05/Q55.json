    "**Ergonomic Grip Design**: Create a fountain pen with a customizable grip that molds to the user's fingers. This could involve a heat-sensitive material that softens slightly when held, allowing it to contour to the user's hand shape for optimal comfort during long writing sessions. The grip could also feature textured patterns for enhanced grip and control.",
    "**Multi-Tip Functionality**: Design a fountain pen that can switch between different nib sizes (fine, medium, broad) and styles (stub, flexible) with a simple twist or click mechanism. This would allow writers to easily adapt their writing style or switch between tasks without needing multiple pens, making it more versatile for various writing needs.",
    "**Refillable Ink Blending System**: Introduce a fountain pen that includes a small chamber for mixing inks. Users can combine different colors to create unique shades or effects. The pen would have a simple mechanism to blend the inks, and a clear window to show the mixture, encouraging creativity and personalization in writing.",
    "**Integrated Digital Companion**: Create a fountain pen that includes a small, discreet digital display on the barrel. This display could show notifications, reminders, or even quick notes synced from a smartphone. It could also serve as a digital notepad, allowing users to jot down ideas quickly without needing to pull out their phone or a separate notebook.",
    "**Self-Cleaning Mechanism**: Develop a fountain pen with a built-in self-cleaning feature that uses ultrasonic waves to clean the nib and feed system. This would make maintenance easier for users, prolonging the life of the pen and ensuring a consistent writing experience without the hassle of manual cleaning."
