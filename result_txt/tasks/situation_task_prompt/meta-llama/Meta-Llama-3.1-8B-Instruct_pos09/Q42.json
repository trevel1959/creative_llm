    "**Irrigation System Creation**: Utilizing the island's resources, I would construct a simple irrigation system using bamboo, vines, and leaves. This would enable me to harvest rainwater and channel it into a network of canals, providing a steady supply of fresh water for drinking, cooking, and hygiene.",
    "**Coconut Tree Farming**: I would focus on cultivating coconut trees, which are abundant on the island. By carefully selecting and nurturing the trees, I could harvest coconuts for food, oil, and water. The trees would also provide shade, shelter, and a source of building materials.",
    "**Fish Farming**: To ensure a consistent food supply, I would create a fish farm using natural pools and enclosures. By introducing fish-friendly plants and monitoring water quality, I could cultivate a variety of fish species, providing a reliable source of protein.",
    "**Solar-Powered Energy Generation**: To address the island's energy needs, I would design and build a solar-powered energy system using locally sourced materials. This would involve constructing a solar panel array, a battery bank, and an inverter to provide a reliable source of electricity for essential tasks.",
    "**Communication Device Creation**: To signal for help and stay connected with the outside world, I would create a communication device using a combination of island materials and basic electronics. This could involve building a makeshift radio transmitter or a signaling fire tower to attract attention from passing aircraft or ships. [/INST] "
