    "Innovative Transportation Solutions: If the world were to run out of oil, it would be a game-changer for the transportation industry. Instead of relying on gas-guzzling vehicles, people would have to turn to alternative modes of transportation such as electric or hybrid cars, public transportation, biking, or even walking. This would lead to a reduction in air pollution and greenhouse gas emissions, making our cities cleaner and healthier to live in. Additionally, there would be a surge in the development of new technologies such as hydrogen fuel cells, solar-powered vehicles, and advanced battery technology.",
    "Renewable Energy Revolution: The world would see a rapid transition to renewable energy sources such as solar, wind, and hydroelectric power. This would lead to a significant reduction in greenhouse gas emissions and a decrease in the world's reliance on fossil fuels. The increased use of renewable energy would also create new job opportunities in the clean energy sector, stimulating economic growth.",
    "Circular Economy: With the depletion of oil resources, the world would need to adopt a circular economy model, where products are designed to be recycled, reused, or biodegradable. This would reduce waste and minimize the use of new resources, leading to a more sustainable future. Companies would need to innovate and find new ways to produce products with minimal environmental impact, and consumers would need to adopt more sustainable lifestyles.",
    "New Agricultural Practices: The world would need to adopt new agricultural practices to ensure food security in the face of a depleted oil supply. This could include the use of vertical farming, hydroponics, and aquaponics to increase food production while minimizing land use and water consumption. These new practices would also lead to a reduction in greenhouse gas emissions from agriculture.",
    "Advanced Technologies: The world would see a rapid development of advanced technologies to replace oil-based products and services. For example, 3D printing would become more prevalent, allowing for the creation of complex products without the need for transportation and storage. Additionally, advances in biotechnology and biomedical engineering would lead to the development of new drugs, medical devices, and other products that were previously reliant on oil-based"
