    "**Multi-Device Pairing with Smart Switching**: Enhance the Bluetooth speaker to allow seamless pairing with multiple devices simultaneously. Users could connect their phone, tablet, and laptop at once, and the speaker would automatically switch between devices based on which one is playing audio. This would eliminate the hassle of disconnecting and reconnecting when changing devices.",
    "**Integrated Voice Assistant with Customization**: Upgrade the speaker to feature an integrated voice assistant that not only responds to commands but also allows users to customize its personality and voice. Users could choose from various voice types, accents, and even personalities (e.g., friendly, professional, humorous) to create a more engaging and personalized interaction experience.",
    "**Eco-Friendly Solar Charging**: Design the speaker with solar panels integrated into its exterior, allowing it to charge using sunlight. This would make the speaker more sustainable and ideal for outdoor use, such as at the beach or during camping trips, reducing reliance on electrical outlets and traditional charging methods.",
    "**Mood Lighting Synchronization**: Incorporate LED lights that can change color and intensity based on the music being played or the mood selected by the user. The lights could sync with the beat of the music, creating an immersive experience for parties or relaxation. Additionally, users could set the lights to a specific color to match their mood or room decor.",
    "**Gesture Control Interface**: Introduce a gesture control feature that allows users to control the speaker without physical contact. Users could swipe their hands in front of the speaker to adjust volume, skip tracks, or play/pause music. This would enhance convenience, especially in situations where users' hands are busy or dirty."
