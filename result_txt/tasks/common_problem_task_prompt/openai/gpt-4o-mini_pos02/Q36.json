    "**Neighborhood Aesthetic Concerns**: The installation of solar panels can alter the visual landscape of a neighborhood. Homeowners' associations (HOAs) or local zoning laws may have regulations regarding the appearance of homes, leading to potential conflicts. Some residents may resist solar panel installations due to concerns about aesthetics, which could create community divisions and legal challenges.",
    "**Financial Barriers**: While solar panels can save money in the long run, the initial investment can be prohibitive for many homeowners. If the city does not provide adequate financial incentives, such as subsidies or low-interest loans, there may be significant disparities in who can afford the installation, leading to inequity among residents.",
    "**Maintenance and Repair Challenges**: Solar panels require ongoing maintenance and occasional repairs. Homeowners may not be aware of the responsibilities that come with ownership, leading to neglect and decreased efficiency over time. Additionally, if many homes in a city install panels simultaneously, there could be a shortage of qualified technicians for maintenance and repairs, causing delays and frustrations.",
    "**Interconnection and Grid Issues**: Integrating a large number of solar panels into the existing electrical grid can create technical challenges. The grid may need upgrades to handle the increased energy flow, and there could be complications with net metering policies. If not managed properly, this could lead to energy inefficiencies, blackouts, or overloading the system.",
    "**Environmental Impact of Manufacturing**: While solar energy is renewable, the manufacturing process for solar panels involves the use of hazardous materials and significant energy consumption. If the city does not consider the environmental impact of the production and disposal of solar panels, the initiative could inadvertently contribute to pollution and waste issues."
