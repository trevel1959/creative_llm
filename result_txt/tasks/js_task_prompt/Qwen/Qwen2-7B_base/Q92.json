    "Add a neutron star: Imagine a neutron star sitting in the center of our solar system, surrounded by an atmosphere of gas and dust. The neutron star would provide a new gravitational force, attracting all the planets and moons towards it. This would create a stunning display of light and color as the planets and moons passed by.",
    "Swap out the planets: Take the planets in our solar system and replace them with new, unknown planets. These planets could have a different size, shape, and orbit, creating a completely new and unique solar system. Imagine a planet with a giant magnetic field or a planet with rings of gas and dust circling it.",
    "Redesign the rings: Our solar system's rings are currently composed of ice, dust, and rock. Imagine redesigning the rings to contain gas and plasma instead, giving them a completely different feel. The plasma could create a stunning display of colors and light as the rings move around the sun.",
    "Add a black hole: Imagine a black hole at the center of our solar system, sucking in everything around it. The gravity of the black hole would affect all the planets and moons in our solar system, creating amazing new sights and sounds. Imagine the planets and moons swirling around the black hole, creating a hypnotic display.",
    "Change the sun: The sun is currently a yellow dwarf, but what if we changed it to a red giant or a white dwarf? Imagine the sun changing color and temperature, creating a completely different solar system. The planets and moons would have to adjust to this new environment, creating a fascinating new ecosystem."
