    "**Multi-Functional Wine Opener**: Design a wine opener that combines multiple tools into one device. It could feature a corkscrew, foil cutter, bottle stopper, and aerator all in one compact design. This would make it convenient for wine enthusiasts who want to carry only one tool for all their wine-opening needs, especially when traveling or attending events.",
    "**Ergonomic and Adjustable Grip**: Develop a wine opener with an ergonomic design that includes an adjustable grip to accommodate different hand sizes and strengths. The handle could be designed to provide maximum leverage with minimal effort, allowing even those with limited hand strength to easily open wine bottles. The grip could also have a non-slip surface for added comfort and control.",
    "**Rechargeable Electric Wine Opener with LED Light**: Innovate an electric wine opener that is rechargeable and features a built-in LED light. The light would illuminate the cork and bottle neck, making it easier to see what you’re doing, especially in dim lighting. The opener could have a quick-charge feature, allowing it to be ready for use after just a short charging period.",
    "**Wine Opener with Built-in Temperature Sensor**: Create a wine opener that incorporates a temperature sensor to measure the wine’s temperature as the cork is removed. This could help wine enthusiasts ensure that their wine is served at the optimal temperature. The opener could alert users if the wine is too warm or too cold, suggesting the ideal serving temperature for different types of wine.",
    "**Sustainable Wine Opener**: Design a wine opener made from eco-friendly materials, such as bamboo or recycled metals. It could also include a feature that allows users to recycle or compost the corks after opening. The packaging could be minimal and made from biodegradable materials, appealing to environmentally conscious consumers who want to reduce their carbon footprint."
