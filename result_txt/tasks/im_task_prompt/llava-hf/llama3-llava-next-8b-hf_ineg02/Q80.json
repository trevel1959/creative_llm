    "Whisk with Built-in Timer: Integrate a small, digital timer into the handle that counts down from a set time (e.g., 10 seconds) and beeps when the whisking time is up. This feature would help ensure consistent whisking times for precise recipes.",
    "Multifunctional Whisk: Develop a whisk with interchangeable heads, such as a flat whisk for better incorporation of ingredients, a forked whisk for better blending, and a silicone whisk for non-stick surfaces. This versatility would make the whisk a valuable tool in various cooking tasks.",
    "Smart Whisk with App Integration: Create a smart whisk that connects to a mobile app or a voice assistant, allowing users to set timers, adjust whisking speeds, and access recipe suggestions without needing to hold the whisk.",
    "Whisk with Adjustable Speed Control: Implement a variable speed control mechanism that allows users to adjust the whisking speed for different types of mixtures. For instance, a slow setting could be used for delicate sauces, while a faster setting would be ideal for whipping heavy batters.",
    "Magnetic Whisk Head: Add a magnetic feature to the whisk that securely attaches to the head, eliminating the need to hold the whisk in place during use. This would save time and effort, especially when working with thick mixtures."
