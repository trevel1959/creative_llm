One day, a little girl named Mira noticed the dull arc and decided to talk to it. She shared stories of hope, dreams, and love, and as she spoke, the rainbow began to shimmer faintly. Inspired, the rainbow started to weave Mira’s tales into its arc, and slowly, colors returned, more brilliant than before. Together, they taught the world that even in darkness, light can be found through connection and kindness.",

Lonely and forgotten, it drifted through the clouds until it met a wise old Owl. The Owl told the Rainbow that colors are not just for show; they are emotions and memories. Inspired, the Rainbow decided to collect stories from those below. Each tale of love, laughter, and sorrow infused it with a new hue. As the stories filled the sky, the Rainbow transformed, vibrant once more, proving that every color tells a story worth sharing.",
