    "**Paperless Office**: Create a digital archive of all documents and resources you typically use for work or studies on a portable hard drive or an encrypted cloud service. This way, if your computer crashes, you can access these files on any other device connected to the internet.",
    "**Manual Note-Taking**: Invest in a high-quality notebook and a fountain pen. Learn to take notes efficiently and organize them into binders or folders. This system ensures you can continue working even without electronic devices. It also helps in developing better memory retention as you manually write down information.",
    "**Collaborative Workspaces**: Use physical spaces like libraries, coffee shops, or coworking offices for your work or study sessions. These places provide reliable power sources, comfortable seating, and sometimes even backup systems (like UPS for power outages). Additionally, they offer opportunities for social interaction which might help in overcoming procrastination.",
    "**Backup Systems**: Always have a backup plan for your data. Consider using external hard drives or USB sticks to regularly back up your important files. You could also look into software solutions that automatically sync your data across multiple devices, ensuring you can access it from anywhere.",
    "**Skill Diversification**: Develop skills in alternative methods of communication, such as learning Morse code or a manual typewriter. While this may seem impractical in today's digital world, having a fallback method could be useful in situations where technology fails completely. For example, you could write down tasks or reminders by hand, which could then be transferred to your digital devices once they are available again."
