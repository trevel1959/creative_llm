    "Build an Atmospheric Water Harvester: Create a device that can extract water from the atmosphere, using a process called atmospheric water harvesting. This technology can collect water vapor from the air and condense it into clean drinking water. The device can be powered by renewable energy sources like solar or wind power, making it a sustainable solution for clean drinking water.",
    "Use Aquaporin Membranes: Develop membranes infused with aquaporins, which are proteins that can selectively filter out impurities from water. These membranes can be used to purify water by removing contaminants and toxins, producing clean drinking water. This technology can be used in water filtration systems, making it easy to obtain clean drinking water in any location.",
    "Create a Water-Solar Still: Design a still that uses the heat of the sun to evaporate water, and then condense it back into clean drinking water. This technology can be used in areas with limited access to clean water, as it doesn't require any electricity or other resources. The still can be made from simple materials like plastic or metal, making it easy to produce and maintain.",
    "Utilize Algae-Based Water Purification: Develop a system that uses algae to purify water. Algae can absorb impurities and toxins from water, and then be harvested and removed, leaving clean drinking water behind. This technology can be used in both small-scale and large-scale applications, making it a versatile solution for clean drinking water.",
    "Develop a Water-Based Smart Home System: Create a smart home system that can detect and purify water in real-time. This system can use sensors and algorithms to detect impurities and toxins in the water, and then purify it using a combination of technologies like UV light, activated carbon, and reverse osmosis. This system can be integrated into homes, offices, and public spaces, providing clean drinking water to anyone who needs it."
