    "**Solar-Infused Radiant Flooring**: Implement a radiant floor heating system that harnesses solar energy. The system would involve installing solar panels on the roof to generate electricity, which would then power a heat pump. The heat pump would warm a liquid, which would be circulated through pipes beneath the floor to warm the space. This system would not only provide warmth but also serve as a backup power source during grid outages.",
    "**Insulated Earth-Sheltered Home**: Design an earth-sheltered home that leverages the natural insulation of the earth to maintain a consistent temperature. The home would be built into a hillside, with thick insulation and a well-sealed envelope to minimize heat loss. During the winter, the earth's natural warmth would be harnessed to warm the space, while in the summer, the earth's cooling properties would be used to keep the home cool.",
    "**Thermal Mass Storage**: Develop a system that utilizes thermal mass materials, such as concrete or brick, to store heat energy during the day. These materials would be heated by the sun or a heat source, and then used to warm the home at night or during periods of cold weather. This system would be particularly effective in regions with mild winters.",
    "**Bio-Based Insulation**: Create a bio-based insulation material from agricultural waste, such as corn cobs or sugarcane bagasse. This material would be highly effective at reducing heat transfer, while also providing a sustainable and renewable alternative to traditional insulation materials.",
    "**Phase Change Materials**: Develop a system that incorporates phase change materials (PCMs) to regulate temperature fluctuations. PCMs would be embedded in walls, floors, or ceilings, and would absorb excess heat during the day, releasing it at night to maintain a consistent temperature. This system would be particularly effective in regions with moderate climates."
