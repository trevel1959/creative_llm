    "**Guest List Dilemma**: Determining the guest list can be challenging, especially when balancing family, friends, and classmates. There's the risk of excluding someone unintentionally, leading to hurt feelings. To mitigate this, involve the birthday child in the process, allowing them to choose their closest friends and family members. Use a digital invitation platform to manage RSVPs, ensuring you have a clear count of attendees and can adjust plans accordingly.",
    "**Activity Over-scheduling**: Planning too many activities can overwhelm both the children and the hosts. If activities are not engaging or are too complicated, kids may lose interest quickly. To counter this, select a few key activities that are age-appropriate and allow for flexibility. For example, include a mix of structured games (like a treasure hunt) and free play time to keep the energy flowing without feeling rushed.",
    "**Food Fiasco**: Catering to a group of 5-year-olds can be tricky due to varying dietary restrictions and preferences. Some kids may have allergies, while others might be picky eaters. To address this, create a simple menu that includes a variety of options, such as fruits, veggies, and a mix of snacks. Clearly label all food items and consider providing a few \"safe\" options like cheese sandwiches or mini pizzas to accommodate different tastes.",
    "**Weather Woes**: If the party is planned outdoors, inclement weather can disrupt the event. Rain or extreme heat can make it uncomfortable for everyone involved. To prepare for this, have a backup plan in place, such as reserving an indoor space or setting up a tent. Additionally, check the weather forecast leading up to the party and communicate any changes to guests promptly.",
    "**Parental Supervision Confusion**: It’s common for parents to drop off their kids at birthday parties, leading to potential supervision issues. Some parents may assume that the hosts will watch all children, while others may want to stay. To avoid confusion, clearly state on the invitation whether parents are welcome to stay or if it’s a drop-off event. Consider assigning a few adults to help supervise activities, ensuring that children are safe and engaged."
