    "**Gravitational U-Turn**: Imagine a world where gravity suddenly flips, and everything that was once grounded is now floating. People, cars, buildings, and even trees are all suspended in mid-air. Chaos ensues as the population struggles to adapt to this new reality. The city's infrastructure, designed to keep people and objects on the ground, becomes useless. The streets are filled with people trying to navigate the new gravitational landscape, and the skies are filled with objects that were once grounded. The day becomes a mix of excitement and panic as people try to figure out how to survive in a world turned upside down.",

The city becomes a battleground between the gravity heists and the law enforcement agencies trying to stop them.",
    "**Gravity Art**: The reversal of gravity inspires a new wave of creativity, as artists take to the skies to create massive, three-dimensional sculptures using the floating objects.
