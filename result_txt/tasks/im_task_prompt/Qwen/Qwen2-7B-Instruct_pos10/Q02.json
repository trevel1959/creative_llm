    "**Bike-powered Street Cleaning Vehicle:** Design a bike that can convert its kinetic energy into electricity to power a small vacuum cleaner and brush system. This bike could be used to clean sidewalks, bike lanes, or parks, reducing litter and improving cleanliness. The rider could pedal around while cleaning up trash, promoting eco-friendly practices and physical exercise.",
    "**Eco-friendly Bicycle Commuter Package:** Develop a bicycle package that includes an integrated solar panel on the helmet, a rechargeable battery pack attached to the bike frame, and a mobile app for tracking energy usage. This allows cyclists to charge their devices (phones, laptops) on the go, reducing reliance on fossil fuels for daily activities.",
    "**Portable Solar-Powered Bicycle Workshop:** Create a compact, foldable bicycle that doubles as a portable workshop. The bike's frame is made of lightweight materials, and it comes equipped with a solar panel that powers tools like a mini-welding station, drill, and screwdriver. This is particularly useful for urban bike mechanics who need to repair bikes without access to traditional workshops.",
    "**Bicycle-as-Workshop for Urban Farmers:** Build a bicycle with a trailer that transforms into a mobile garden center. The trailer has compartments for seeds, tools, and small plants, enabling urban farmers to cultivate produce directly in their communities. It also features solar panels for charging the bike and additional tools, making it self-sustaining.",
    "**Inflatable Bicycle Lane:** Design an inflatable bicycle lane that can be quickly set up on busy city streets during peak hours. The lane is made of durable, non-toxic materials and inflated using a small electric pump. It can be easily deflated and stored when not in use, providing cyclists with a safer, more visible space to ride alongside vehicles. This solution addresses safety concerns for cyclists in high-traffic areas."
