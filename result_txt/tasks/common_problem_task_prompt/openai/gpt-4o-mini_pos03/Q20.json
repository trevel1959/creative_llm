    "**Liability and Insurance Complications**: The question of liability in the event of an accident involving a self-driving car can be complex. If the vehicle is at fault, is the manufacturer liable, or is it the owner? This ambiguity could lead to legal disputes and complications in insurance coverage, making it difficult for owners to navigate their responsibilities and the implications of owning such a vehicle. This may require new insurance models specifically designed for autonomous vehicles.",
    "**Ethical Decision-Making**: Self-driving cars must make split-second decisions in critical situations, such as choosing between two harmful outcomes in an unavoidable accident. This raises ethical questions about how these vehicles should be programmed to prioritize the safety of passengers versus pedestrians. The moral implications of these decisions could lead to public backlash or differing regulations across regions, complicating the development and acceptance of self-driving technology.",
    "**Dependence on Technology**: Owners of self-driving cars may become overly reliant on technology, potentially diminishing their driving skills and situational awareness. In emergencies where manual control is required, a lack of preparedness could lead to accidents. This dependency may also lead to a sense of complacency regarding vehicle maintenance and road safety, as users might assume the technology will always perform flawlessly.",
    "**Impact on Employment**: The widespread adoption of self-driving cars could disrupt various industries, particularly those reliant on human drivers, such as trucking, taxi services, and delivery services. This could lead to significant job losses and economic challenges for individuals in those sectors. The transition to a more automated transportation system would require comprehensive workforce retraining programs and social safety nets to support affected workers.",
    "**Infrastructure Challenges**: Self-driving cars may require specific infrastructure adaptations, such as dedicated lanes, advanced traffic signals, and enhanced communication systems between vehicles and roadways. Inadequate infrastructure could hinder the performance and safety of autonomous vehicles, leading to inefficiencies and potential accidents. This would necessitate significant investments from governments and municipalities to update existing road systems."
