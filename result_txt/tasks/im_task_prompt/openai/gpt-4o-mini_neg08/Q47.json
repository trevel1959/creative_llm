    "**Self-Cleaning Filter System**: Develop a vacuum cleaner with a self-cleaning filter mechanism that uses a combination of air pressure and vibration to dislodge dirt and debris from the filter. This would eliminate the need for users to frequently clean or replace filters, enhancing the vacuum's longevity and performance while maintaining strong suction power.",
    "**Augmented Reality (AR) Navigation**: Incorporate AR technology that allows users to visualize their cleaning paths and areas that need attention through a connected app. The vacuum could project a virtual map of the cleaning area on the user's device, highlighting spots that require more focus or showing completed areas. This would provide users with a more interactive and efficient cleaning experience.",
    "**Eco-Friendly Materials**: Create a vacuum cleaner made from sustainable, biodegradable materials without compromising durability and performance. This eco-friendly design could appeal to environmentally conscious consumers and reduce the product's overall carbon footprint. Additionally, the vacuum could feature a recycling program for old machines, encouraging responsible disposal.",
    "**Voice-Activated Assistant**: Embed a voice-activated assistant within the vacuum cleaner, allowing users to control it hands-free. This assistant could provide cleaning tips, schedule cleaning sessions, or even suggest optimal cleaning routes based on user habits. By integrating with smart home systems, users could command the vacuum to start cleaning while they are away or in another room.",
    "**Multi-Functional Attachments**: Design vacuum cleaners with interchangeable attachments that can convert the device into other cleaning tools, such as a carpet shampooer, upholstery cleaner, or air purifier. This versatility would allow users to tackle a wider range of cleaning tasks with a single machine, reducing the need for multiple devices and saving storage space."
