    "**Interactive Sandwich Toaster**: Develop a sandwich toaster with an integrated touchscreen interface where users can select their desired ingredients and types of bread for their sandwiches. The toaster could have pre-programmed recipes for popular sandwiches, and also allow users to input custom recipes. Each selection would automatically adjust the heating time and temperature based on the chosen ingredients and bread type.",
    "**Healthy Sandwich Toaster**: Design a toaster that incorporates health features like a built-in air fryer function, allowing for the preparation of healthier sandwiches without using excessive oil. It could also have a feature to detect when certain ingredients are ready, such as when a tomato is sufficiently heated or when cheese has melted, ensuring optimal flavor and nutrition.",
    "**Smart Sandwich Toaster**: Create a smart toaster that connects to smartphones through Bluetooth or Wi-Fi. Users can control the toaster from their phone, including adjusting cooking times, temperatures, and even receiving notifications when their sandwich is ready. The toaster could also sync with dietary apps or wearables to suggest healthy sandwich options based on user preferences and nutritional goals.",
    "**Personalized Sandwich Toaster**: Offer a toaster that allows users to customize the toasting level for each slice of bread independently. This ensures that one person in a household doesn't have to compromise their preferred level of toastiness. The toaster could also come with interchangeable plates that can grill, press, or bake different types of fillings, making it versatile for various sandwich styles.",
    "**Sustainable Sandwich Toaster**: Design a toaster made from sustainable materials, such as bamboo or recycled plastics, which reduces its environmental impact. The toaster could also include features that promote sustainability, like a recycling bin for used bags or packaging. Additionally, it could encourage minimal waste by allowing users to prepare smaller portions of sandwiches, thus reducing food waste."
