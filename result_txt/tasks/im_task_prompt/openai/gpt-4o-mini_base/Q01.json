    "**Modular Design**: Create a wristwatch with a modular design that allows users to customize and upgrade different components. For instance, users could swap out the battery module for a solar-powered one, or change the watch face to suit different occasions. This would not only make the watch more versatile but also promote sustainability by reducing electronic waste.",
    "**Augmented Reality (AR) Interface**: Incorporate AR technology that projects a holographic display above the watch face. Users could interact with notifications, messages, and even navigation prompts through gestures, providing a futuristic and hands-free experience. This would also allow for a more immersive way to engage with fitness tracking and goal setting.",
    "**Integrated Payment System**: Enhance the wristwatch with a built-in secure payment system that allows users to make contactless payments without needing to pull out their phones or wallets. This could be linked to various payment platforms and include features like budgeting tools that help users track their spending in real-time.",
    "**Personalized AI Assistant**: Embed an AI assistant that learns the user's habits and preferences over time. This assistant could provide reminders, schedule appointments, suggest workout routines based on the user's activity levels, and even control smart home devices, making the wristwatch a central hub for personal management.",
    "**Eco-Friendly Materials**: Develop a line of wristwatches made from sustainable and biodegradable materials, such as recycled plastics or plant-based polymers. This would cater to environmentally conscious consumers and promote a greener approach to fashion and technology."
