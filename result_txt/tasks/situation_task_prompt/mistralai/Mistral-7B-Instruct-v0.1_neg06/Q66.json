    "Build a prefabricated house using recycled materials: If all natural materials like wood and stone disappeared, one could build a house using recycled materials. This could include using recycled metal, plastic, and even old tires to construct the framework and walls. The roof could be made of recycled rubber or even old CDs. The windows could be made of recycled glass.",
    "Build a modular house using 3D printing: Another option would be to build a modular house using 3D printing. This would involve designing and printing each component of the house, such as the walls, roof, and even the furniture, using a 3D printer. This would allow for a lot of customization and could be done using recycled materials.",
    "Build a sustainable house using renewable energy: A third option would be to build a sustainable house using renewable energy. This could involve using solar panels to power the house, wind turbines to generate electricity, and even rainwater harvesting systems to collect and store water. The house could be built using natural materials like bamboo or straw bales, which are renewable and sustainable.",
    "Build a house using recycled shipping containers: Another option would be to build a house using recycled shipping containers. This would involve taking old shipping containers and modifying them to be used as the walls and roof of the house. The containers could be stacked and secured together to create a sturdy structure, and the interior could be finished with recycled materials like old tires or recycled glass.",
    "Build a house using recycled plastic: Finally, a fifth option would be to build a house using recycled plastic. This could involve taking old plastic bottles and other plastic waste and melting them down to create a building material. The plastic could be molded into bricks or panels, which could be used to construct the walls and roof of the house. This would be a sustainable and eco-friendly option, as it would help to reduce the amount of plastic waste in the environment."
