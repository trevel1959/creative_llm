    "**Personalized Light Therapy**: With the disappearance of corrective eyewear, people with poor vision would need to adapt to their new reality. One possible solution could be the development of personalized light therapy treatments. These treatments would use advanced technology to adjust the intensity and spectrum of light to help individuals with different types of vision impairments. For example, people with nearsightedness could receive light therapy that focuses on the peripheral vision, while those with farsightedness could receive light therapy that enhances their central vision. This technology could be integrated into wearable devices or even incorporated into daily routines, such as during meditation or relaxation exercises.",
    "**Brain-Computer Interface (BCI) Technology**: In the absence of corrective eyewear, people with poor vision could rely on BCI technology to interact with their environment. BCIs would allow individuals to control devices with their thoughts, effectively bypassing the need for visual input. This technology could be used to control smart home devices, communicate with others, or even access information through virtual assistants. BCIs could also be used to enhance cognitive abilities, such as memory and attention, which could be beneficial for individuals with vision impairments.",
    "**Tactile Navigation Systems**: To navigate their surroundings, people with poor vision could utilize tactile navigation systems. These systems would provide a physical representation of the environment, allowing individuals to \"feel\" their way through spaces. This could be achieved through the use of raised lines or Braille-like patterns on surfaces, or even through the use of wearable devices that provide haptic feedback. Tactile navigation systems could be integrated into public spaces, such as shopping malls or public transportation, to create a more inclusive and accessible environment.",
    "**Sound-Based Communication**: In a world without corrective eyewear, people with poor vision could rely on sound-based communication to interact with others. This could be achieved through the use of audio descriptions, audio cues, or even sign language interpretation. Sound-based communication could be integrated into daily life, such as through the use of smart speakers or voice assistants that provide real-time audio descriptions of visual information. This could also lead to the development of new forms of sign language and non-verbal communication.",
    "**Enhanced Sensory Perception**: People with poor vision could develop enhanced sensory perception through training and practice. This could involve exercises that focus on developing other senses, such as hearing, smell, or even touch. For example, individuals could learn to identify different scents or sounds to navigate their environment. This could also lead"
