    "**Smart Helmet with Integrated Navigation**: Design a helmet with an integrated GPS, compass, and turn-by-turn navigation system. The helmet would have a small display screen on the front, showing the rider's route, speed, and distance traveled. The system would also include a voice assistant, allowing riders to receive turn-by-turn directions and make hands-free calls. The helmet would be equipped with a rechargeable battery, ensuring a full day's worth of navigation without needing to recharge.",
    "**Air-Powered Bicycle Helmet**: Create a helmet that utilizes compressed air to enhance safety features. The helmet would have a built-in air compressor, which would inflate a series of small airbags or bladders located around the helmet. In the event of an accident, the airbags would rapidly deploy, providing additional protection for the rider's head and neck. The helmet would also include a feature to automatically deflate the airbags after the ride, making it easier to store and transport.",
    "**Bicycle Helmet with Integrated Health Monitoring**: Develop a helmet that tracks the rider's vital signs, including heart rate, blood pressure, and oxygen levels. The helmet would be equipped with a series of sensors and a small display screen on the front, showing the rider's real-time health data. The system would also include a feature to alert the rider if their vital signs exceed safe limits, providing an early warning system for potential health issues.",
    "**Solar-Powered Bicycle Helmet**: Design a helmet with integrated solar panels, allowing riders to harness the power of the sun to charge their devices on the go. The helmet would have a small solar panel on the rear, connected to a rechargeable battery and a USB port. Riders could use the USB port to charge their smartphones, GPS devices, or other portable electronics while riding.",
    "**Bicycle Helmet with Integrated Safety Features for Vulnerable Road Users**: Create a helmet designed specifically for cyclists, pedestrians, and other vulnerable road users. The helmet would have a built-in system that detects and alerts the user to potential hazards, such as approaching vehicles or pedestrians. The helmet would also include a feature to automatically deploy a small, deployable shield or canopy to provide additional protection in emergency situations. The shield would be made of a lightweight, impact-resistant material and would be designed to deploy quickly and easily. "
