    "**Smart Glasses with Augmented Reality (AR)**: Integrate AR technology into glasses, allowing users to overlay digital information onto the real world. For instance, users could see navigation prompts while walking, get real-time translations of signs in foreign languages, or view notifications from their smartphones. This would enhance everyday experiences and provide hands-free access to information.",
    "**Self-Cleaning Coating**: Introduce a self-cleaning nanotechnology coating for lenses that repels dust, water, and fingerprints. This coating would utilize hydrophobic and oleophobic properties to ensure that lenses remain clear and smudge-free, reducing the need for constant cleaning and enhancing the longevity of the glasses.",
    "**Customizable Frame Design**: Create a modular glasses frame system where users can mix and match different components (temples, front frames, nose pads) in various colors and materials. This would allow individuals to personalize their eyewear according to their style, mood, or occasion, making glasses a fashion statement as well as a functional item.",
    "**Built-in Health Monitoring**: Integrate health monitoring sensors into the glasses that track vital signs such as heart rate, blood pressure, and even blood oxygen levels. These glasses could sync with a mobile app to provide insights into the wearerâ€™s health and alert them to any abnormalities, promoting proactive health management.",
    "**Virtual Try-On Feature**: Develop an app that uses augmented reality to allow users to virtually try on different styles of glasses before purchasing. Using facial recognition technology, the app would accurately fit frames to the user's face, providing a realistic view of how different designs look and feel, enhancing the online shopping experience."
