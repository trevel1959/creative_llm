    "Volatility: Currencies are known for their volatility, and cryptocurrencies are no exception. This means that their value can fluctuate greatly day-to-day, which can lead to significant market volatility.",
    "Limited Accessibility: Some people may have difficulty accessing cryptocurrencies due to factors such as a lack of understanding or technical know-how to set up a digital wallet.",
    "Limited Legal Framework: As cryptocurrencies are not yet widely recognized as legal tender, it can be difficult for them to find acceptance in various contexts, such as making a purchase or being used in financial transactions.",
    "Difficulty of Hacking and Cybersecurity: Cryptocurrencies are digital and are therefore vulnerable to hacking and cyberattacks. This increases the risk of people losing their funds if their digital wallet information is accessed without authorization.",
    "Limited Infrastructure: While the number of cryptocurrencies is increasing, many cryptocurrencies do not have the same level of trading volume or liquidity as traditional currencies. This can make it challenging to find buyers or sellers when trading cryptocurrencies."
