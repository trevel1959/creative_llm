    "Shade-seeking drones: Develop a fleet of autonomous drones equipped with solar-powered canopies that can fly and provide shade on hot days. These drones could be deployed in areas with high temperatures, such as cities or parks, and could be controlled remotely or programmed to fly to specific locations.",
    "Urban canopies: Design and install collapsible, modular canopies that can be assembled in urban areas to provide shade. These canopies could be made of lightweight, breathable materials and could be easily assembled and disassembled as needed.",
    "Shade-producing buildings: Develop buildings that are designed to produce their own shade through the use of solar panels or reflective surfaces. These buildings could be equipped with retractable canopies or awnings that can be deployed on hot days to provide additional shade.",
    "Shade-generating streets: Create streets that are designed to generate shade through the use of built-in canopies or reflective surfaces. These streets could be made of materials that reflect sunlight or use a canopy system that can be deployed on hot days to provide shade.",
    "Personal shade pods: Develop portable, wearable shade pods that can be worn on the body to provide personal shade. These pods could be made of lightweight, breathable materials and could be powered by solar panels or batteries. They could be designed to fit different body types and could be customized with different colors or patterns."
