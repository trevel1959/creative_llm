    "\"Nexus Energy\" - A new form of energy that is generated through the convergence of multiple forms of energy, such as solar, wind, and hydroelectric power. This energy is harnessed through the use of a special device that captures and converts the energy from multiple sources into a single, powerful force. The device would be small and portable, making it accessible to individuals and communities.",
    "\"Thermoelectric Energy\" - A new form of energy that is generated through the conversion of heat into electricity. This energy is harnessed through the use of a special material that can generate an electric current when exposed to a temperature difference. The material would be used in a variety of devices, such as thermoelectric generators, which could be used to power homes and businesses.",
    "\"Quantum Energy\" - A new form of energy that is generated through the manipulation of quantum particles. This energy is harnessed through the use of a special device that can create and control quantum particles, which are then used to generate an electric current. The device would be small and portable, making it accessible to individuals and communities.",
    "\"Fusion Energy\" - A new form of energy that is generated through the fusion of atomic nuclei. This energy is harnessed through the use of a special device that can create and control the fusion reaction, which releases a tremendous amount of energy. The device would be large and expensive, making it suitable for use in power plants and other large-scale energy production facilities.",
    "\"Bioluminescent Energy\" - A new form of energy that is generated through the use of bioluminescent organisms. This energy is harnessed through the use of a special device that can capture and convert the light emitted by bioluminescent organisms into electricity. The device would be small and portable, making it accessible to individuals and communities."
