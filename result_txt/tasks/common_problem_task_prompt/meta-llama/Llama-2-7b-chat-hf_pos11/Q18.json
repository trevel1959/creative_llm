    "Community-based energy sharing: Develop a neighborhood-scale energy-sharing system that utilizes solar panels, wind turbines, and batteries to provide electricity to homes without the need for a centralized grid. Each house would have its own energy source and a sharing system that allows them to trade energy with their neighbors. This would create a self-sustaining community that is both environmentally friendly and cost-effective.",
    "Green energy hubs: Establish designated areas in urban centers where green energy sources such as solar, wind, and hydroelectric power are generated and stored. These hubs could be located on rooftops, in parks, or even in abandoned industrial sites. The energy generated could be sold to nearby businesses and homes, providing a sustainable alternative to traditional grid electricity.",
    "Personal energy harvesting: Develop wearable technology that harnesses the body's natural energy to power small devices such as smartphones, fitness trackers, and even clothing. This could be achieved through the use of piezoelectric materials that convert kinetic energy into electricity. This would allow individuals to generate their own electricity on the go, providing a convenient and sustainable solution for those living without access to a centralized grid.",
    "Solar-powered water purification: Develop a portable, solar-powered water purification system that can be used in remote areas without access to clean drinking water. The system would use solar energy to power a filtration system that removes impurities and contaminants from water, providing clean drinking water for those in need.",
    "Community-based food production: Establish a system of community gardens and greenhouses that provide fresh produce to local residents. These gardens could be powered by renewable energy sources such as solar or wind power, and could also serve as educational centers for sustainable agriculture practices. This would create a self-sufficient community that is able to provide for its own food needs, while also promoting sustainable living practices."
