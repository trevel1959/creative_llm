    "**Solar-Powered Lanterns**: Instead of traditional lamps, you could use a series of solar-powered lanterns placed strategically around the room. These lanterns would charge during the day, using solar panels, and provide a warm glow at night. They could be designed in various styles, from rustic to modern, and could be hung from the ceiling or placed on shelves. This would not only illuminate the space but also add an element of decor that changes with the seasons.",
    "**Firefly-Inspired LED Strings**: Create a whimsical lighting solution by using strings of tiny LED lights that mimic the appearance of fireflies. These could be draped around furniture, along shelves, or even hung from the ceiling to create a magical atmosphere. The lights could be programmed to twinkle or change colors, giving the room a dynamic feel that resembles a summer night outdoors.",
    "**Reflective Surfaces**: Design the room with materials that reflect and amplify natural light. Mirrors, polished metals, and glossy finishes could be used to bounce any available light around the room. Additionally, strategically placed reflective panels could catch and direct light from outside, even on cloudy nights. This would create a bright, airy feel without the need for traditional lighting.",
    "**Glow-in-the-Dark Furniture**: Imagine furniture pieces that are designed with glow-in-the-dark materials. Chairs, tables, or even bookshelves could be infused with luminescent substances that charge during the day and emit light at night. This would not only provide functional illumination but also serve as a unique design element, transforming the room into a luminous space.",
    "**Scented Candles with Embedded Crystals**: Candles have long been a source of light, but you could take it a step further by embedding crystals within the wax that reflect and refract light. When lit, these candles would cast colorful patterns across the room, creating an enchanting atmosphere. Additionally, you could use scented candles to add an aromatic element, enhancing the overall experience of the space."
