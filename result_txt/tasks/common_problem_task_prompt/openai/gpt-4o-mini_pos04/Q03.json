    "**Feature Creep**: As the design process unfolds, stakeholders may continually suggest new features, leading to \"feature creep.\" This can dilute the product's core purpose, extend development timelines, and inflate costs. To counter this, a clear project scope should be established at the outset, and any new feature requests should be evaluated against the original goals and user needs. Implementing a change control process can help manage additions effectively.",
    "**Inadequate Scalability**: A software product designed without considering future growth can encounter performance issues as user demand increases. If the architecture is not scalable, it may struggle to handle a larger user base or more data, leading to crashes or slow performance. To address this, developers should adopt a modular architecture and use cloud services that allow for dynamic scaling based on user load.",
    "**Security Vulnerabilities**: In the rush to launch a new software product, security may be overlooked, leaving the software susceptible to breaches. If sensitive user data is compromised, it can lead to significant reputational damage and legal ramifications. Implementing security best practices from the beginning, including regular audits, encryption, and compliance with data protection regulations, is essential to safeguard user information.",
    "**Integration Challenges**: If the new software product needs to interact with existing systems or third-party applications, integration issues may arise. Compatibility problems can lead to data silos, decreased efficiency, and user frustration. To prevent this, the design should include a thorough analysis of the systems with which it will need to integrate, and developers should prioritize building robust APIs and middleware solutions.",
    "**Inconsistent User Experience (UX)**: A lack of coherence in the design elements and user flows can result in a frustrating user experience. If different parts of the software look and behave inconsistently, users may become confused and disengaged. Establishing a comprehensive style guide and conducting UX audits throughout the design process can help maintain consistency and ensure a seamless experience."
