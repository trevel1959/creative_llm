    "Lack of water: Potable water is another scarce resource on a deserted island. The person may collect rainwater or sea water (which would need to be desalted using a makeshift still) to stay hydrated. If they're stuck on the island for an extended period, these sources may not be sufficient. They could attempt to find springs or rivers hidden on the island or experiment with distillation techniques to access fresh water.",
    "Shelter: Protection from the elements, such as extreme weather conditions and UV radiation, would be crucial for a person stranded on a deserted island. Using any available debris, such as branches from the potted plant shown in the image, they could construct a shelter to protect themselves from the sun, rain, and wind. The person might have to experiment with techniques that involve stacking branches or using leaves to create insulation.",
    "Communication: Being isolated could make it difficult for a person to communicate with others for help. They might need to invent ways to amplify their voice or use signals to attract other mariners or island inhabitants. Developing a makeshift communication system could be a key challenge if they are left without any electronic means of communication.",
    "Loneliness and mental health: Living alone on a deserted island would understandably take its toll on the individual's mental health. The person might need to devise strategies to prevent loneliness and maintain psychological well-being, such as keeping journals, drawing, or engaging in physical activity to release endorphins and stay active.",
    "Safety: The person might face potential dangers on the deserted island, such as snakes, wild birds, or unstable weather conditions. They would need to learn how to coexist with the island's wildlife and stay cautious of sudden changes in weather."
