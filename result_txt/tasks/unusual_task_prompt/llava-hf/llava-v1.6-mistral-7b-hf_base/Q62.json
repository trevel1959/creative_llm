    "Ice Pack: Another unconventional use for a lunchbox is to make an ice pack! First, fill the lunchbox with water and place it in the freezer. Once it's chilled, you can use it to keep your food and drinks cool on a hot day. Place the frozen lunchbox inside a cooler along with your other food items, or put it between your hands and your armpits to cool you down.",
    "Plant Pot: A lunchbox can also be repurposed as a plant pot. Simply punch a few holes in the bottom for drainage, add soil, and plant your seeds. Your lunchbox planter will eventually grow into a green, self-watering plant that can be moved around the house or placed outdoors.",
    "Portable Drawing Table: With some light sanding and a bit of acrylic paint or dry-erase markers, you can convert a lunchbox into a portable drawing or writing tablet. Draw or write on the outside surface of the lunchbox, which you can then wipe clean with a damp cloth.",
    "Seed Planter: Small lunchboxes with compartments can be used as seed pots for mini indoor herb gardens. Fill each compartment with soil and sow seeds, making sure to label each area so you know what you're growing. Once the plants are sprouting, place the lunchbox herb garden on a sunny windowsill or in a well-lit area for optimal growth.",
    "Storage: A lunchbox can also be used for storage when you're traveling or on-the-go. Use it to store medications, snacks, or other small items, and bring it with you wherever you go."
