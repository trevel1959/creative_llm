    "**Atmospheric Water Harvesting (AWH)**: Implement large-scale AWH systems that extract clean water from the air, utilizing advanced technologies such as condensation, desiccants, or membrane-based systems. These systems can be powered by renewable energy sources, ensuring a sustainable and reliable source of clean drinking water.",
    "**Closed-Loop Water Recycling**: Develop and deploy closed-loop water recycling systems that can efficiently treat and reuse wastewater from various sources, including industrial, agricultural, and domestic wastewater. This approach would minimize the amount of wastewater discharged into the environment and reduce the demand on freshwater sources.",
    "**Underground Water Storage**: Create extensive networks of underground water storage facilities, such as aquifers or caverns, to store and manage water resources. This would allow for the efficient distribution of clean drinking water to areas in need, while also providing a buffer against droughts and water scarcity.",
    "**Solar-Powered Water Purification**: Develop and deploy solar-powered water purification systems that utilize advanced technologies such as membrane distillation, UV disinfection, or chemical treatment. These systems would provide a clean and reliable source of drinking water, especially in remote or off-grid areas.",
    "**Floating Wetlands and Water Purification**: Design and implement large-scale floating wetlands that incorporate water purification systems, such as biofiltration or phytoremediation. These systems would utilize natural processes to remove pollutants and contaminants from water, providing a sustainable and eco-friendly solution for clean drinking water."
