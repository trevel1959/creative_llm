    "Carrier Pigeons: In the event of an electronic communication blackout, pigeons could be trained to carry messages between countries. This method would require a network of pigeon trainers and lofts to ensure a reliable and efficient communication system.",
    "Optical Signals: Using a combination of mirrors and lenses, a series of optical signals could be arranged along a predetermined route. These signals could be used to convey messages between countries, providing a visual means of communication.",
    "Underground Tunnels: An extensive network of underground tunnels could be constructed to facilitate communication between countries. This system would rely on a network of trained messengers who would travel through the tunnels to deliver messages.",
    "Homing Pigeons: Similar to carrier pigeons, homing pigeons could be trained to find their way between countries. This method would require a detailed understanding of the pigeons' homing abilities and the establishment of a network of pigeon lofts.",
    "Coded Drumming: A complex system of drumming patterns could be devised to convey messages between countries. This method would require a network of trained drummers who would use specific rhythms to convey information. Each country would need to have a team of drummers who could communicate with one another to ensure efficient communication."
