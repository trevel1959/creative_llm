    "**Eco-Friendly Reusable Candle Shells**: Create a line of candles that come in durable, reusable shells made from sustainable materials. Once the wax burns down, users can refill the shell with new wax or a different scent. This would reduce waste and allow for customizable experiences. The shells could also come in various artistic designs, encouraging users to collect them.",
    "**Scented Mood-Enhancing Candles**: Develop a range of candles infused with essential oils specifically blended to enhance moods or alleviate stress. For example, a \"Focus\" candle could contain a mix of peppermint and lemon, while a \"Relax\" candle might feature lavender and chamomile. These candles could be marketed alongside mindfulness practices or relaxation techniques, making them a holistic wellness product.",
    "**Interactive Candle Art**: Design candles that feature a layer of wax that can be carved or drawn into while burning. As the candle melts, users can create intricate designs, messages, or even sculptures, turning the act of burning a candle into a creative outlet. This could be especially appealing for children or during social gatherings where guests can participate in crafting.",
    "**Color-Changing Candles**: Introduce candles that change color as they burn. Using special wax or additives, the candle could transition through a spectrum of colors, creating a visual spectacle. This feature could be synchronized with music for events, where the candleâ€™s color shifts in time with the beat, adding an immersive element to parties or gatherings.",
    "**Candle with Built-in Aroma Diffuser**: Combine the traditional candle with an aroma diffuser. The candle would burn normally, but it would also have a compartment that releases essential oils or fragrance oils when heated. This dual function allows for a more intense scent experience and can cater to those who prefer different scents at various times without needing multiple products."
