    "**Hovering Drones**: Design a fleet of small, lightweight drones that can hover over plants and use their rotors to transfer pollen from one flower to another. The drones would be equipped with sensors to locate flowers and could be controlled remotely.",
    "**Robotic Pollinators**: Create a robot that can mimic the behavior of pollinators like bees or butterflies. The robot would be programmed to move from one flower to another, collecting pollen and transferring it to other flowers.",
    "**Infrasonic Pollination**: Develop a system that uses infrasonic sound waves to stimulate pollen transfer. The system could be installed in greenhouses or gardens and would be designed to mimic the natural pollination process.",
    "**Artificial Pollen**: Create a method of artificially producing pollen that can be used to pollinate plants. This could involve growing pollen-producing plants in a controlled environment and collecting the pollen for use in pollination.",
    "**Magnetic Pollination**: Develop a system that uses magnetic fields to attract pollen from one flower to another. The system could be installed in greenhouses or gardens and would be designed to mimic the natural pollination process."
