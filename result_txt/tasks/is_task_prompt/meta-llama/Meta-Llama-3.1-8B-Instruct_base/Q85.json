Every night, when the moon was full and the stars shone bright, Luna would come alive, its peaks swaying to the rhythm of an invisible orchestra. The trees around it would sway in harmony, creating a mesmerizing spectacle that attracted creatures from far and wide.",

As she watched the mountain dance, she discovered that its movements held secrets and stories of the past, and that by listening to its rhythm, she could tap into the collective memory of the forest.",
