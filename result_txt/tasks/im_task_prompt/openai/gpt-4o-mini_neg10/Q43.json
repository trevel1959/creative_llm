    "**Multi-Sensory Cooking Experience**: Integrate a system of scents and sounds into the oven. As the food cooks, the oven could release aromatic scents that match the dish being prepared (like garlic for Italian food or spices for Indian cuisine). Additionally, it could play ambient sounds or music that complement the cooking process, creating a more immersive cooking experience.",
    "**Adaptive Cooking Mode**: Introduce an adaptive cooking mode that uses sensors to detect the moisture and temperature of the food inside. The oven could adjust cooking times and temperatures in real-time, ensuring that every dish is cooked perfectly. This feature could also include a learning algorithm that improves its accuracy based on past cooking experiences.",
    "**Built-in Food Scanner**: Equip the oven with a built-in scanner that can read barcodes or QR codes on food packaging. Once scanned, the oven could automatically set the optimal cooking settings based on the type of food, including temperature and time. This would simplify meal preparation and reduce the chances of undercooking or overcooking.",
    "**Interactive Touchscreen Display**: Replace the traditional knobs and buttons with an interactive touchscreen display. This screen could provide visual recipes, cooking tips, and even video tutorials. Users could swipe through different cooking options, adjust settings with ease, and access a library of recipes directly from the oven.",
    "**Eco-Friendly Cooking Mode**: Introduce an eco-friendly cooking mode that optimizes energy usage. This mode could use smart technology to analyze energy consumption and adjust cooking methods accordingly. For example, it could switch to a convection mode for certain dishes to reduce energy use or suggest batch cooking to maximize efficiency."
