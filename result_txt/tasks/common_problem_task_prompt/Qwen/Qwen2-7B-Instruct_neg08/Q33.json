    "**Isolation and Mental Health**: Being alone on a deserted island for an extended period can lead to severe mental health issues such as loneliness, depression, and anxiety. The lack of human interaction can make one feel isolated and helpless, which might result in feelings of despair or hopelessness.",
    "**Physical Health Issues**: Living outdoors without medical facilities means that injuries, infections, and other health issues could become life-threatening without proper treatment. Basic first aid skills are crucial but not enough; there might be no way to receive more advanced medical care if needed.",
    "**Weather and Environmental Challenges**: Depending on the location of the island, extreme weather conditions such as hurricanes, storms, and intense heat or cold could pose significant risks. Navigating these conditions requires knowledge of how to build shelters that can withstand such elements.",
    "**Communication**: Communication with the outside world is virtually impossible without technology or signals that can reach civilization. This lack of communication could mean that help is not coming, and the individual is left to fend for themselves indefinitely.",
    "**Survival Skills**: Essential survival skills, including fire-making, navigation, and building tools, must be mastered. Without these skills, basic needs like cooking food, finding directions, or creating tools could become insurmountable obstacles."
