    "Smart Toothbrush with Built-in Microbiome Analysis: This toothbrush would have a small, discreet sensor that analyzes the user's oral microbiome, providing personalized insights into their oral health. It could detect the presence of specific bacteria, fungi, or viruses, and offer recommendations for improvement. For instance, if the toothbrush detects a high level of Streptococcus mutans, it might suggest a specific mouthwash or toothpaste to help reduce acid production. This information could be stored on the toothbrush's companion app, allowing users to track their progress over time and make data-driven decisions about their oral care routine.",
    "Toothbrush with Integrated UV Light Sanitizer: This toothbrush would feature a small, rechargeable UV light that sanitizes the bristles after each use. This would eliminate any remaining bacteria or viruses on the bristles, providing an additional layer of protection against the spread of infection. The UV light could also be used to sanitize other oral care tools, such as tongue scrapers or interdental brushes. To enhance user experience, the toothbrush could include a gentle vibration or beep to signal when the sanitizing cycle is complete.",
    "Toothbrush with Adaptive Bristle Technology: This toothbrush would feature bristles that adjust their stiffness and flexibility in real-time, based on the user's individual oral anatomy and brushing style. For example, if the toothbrush detects that the user is brushing too hard, it could soften the bristles to reduce pressure. Conversely, if the toothbrush detects that the user is brushing too gently, it could stiffen the bristles to improve cleaning effectiveness. This technology could be achieved through the use of advanced materials, such as shape-memory alloys or electroactive polymers.",
    "Toothbrush with AI-Powered Brushing Coach: This toothbrush would include an AI-powered coaching system that provides real-time feedback on the user's brushing technique. The AI could analyze the user's brushing patterns, speed, and pressure, and offer personalized suggestions for improvement. For instance, if the AI detects that the user is not brushing long enough, it might suggest a 30-second extension to the brushing cycle. The AI could also provide educational content, such as videos or animations, to help users understand the importance of proper brushing technique.",
    "Toothbrush with Integrated Dental Chalk: This toothbrush would feature a small container of dental chalk, a type of non-toxic, edible powder that can be used to temporarily fill in gaps between teeth. The dental chalk could be"
