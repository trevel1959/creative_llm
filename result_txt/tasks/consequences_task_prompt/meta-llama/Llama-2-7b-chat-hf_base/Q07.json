    "Decreased Global Connectivity: If the internet were to cease to exist, people would no longer be able to access information, communicate with each other, or engage in online activities such as shopping, banking, or social media. This would lead to a significant decrease in global connectivity, causing people to rely on traditional means of communication such as phone calls, letters, and face-to-face interactions.",
    "Economic Consequences: The internet has become an integral part of modern-day economies, and its absence would have severe consequences for businesses and industries that rely on it. E-commerce, online banking, and digital marketing would all come to a grinding halt, leading to a significant decline in economic activity. This could result in widespread job losses, financial instability, and a decline in the overall standard of living.",
    "Loss of Access to Information: The internet provides access to an immense amount of information, including educational resources, news, and research materials. Without the internet, people would no longer be able to access these resources, leading to a significant loss of knowledge and understanding. This could have far-reaching consequences for education, research, and the dissemination of information.",
    "Decline of Democracy: The internet has played a crucial role in democratic processes, providing a platform for free speech, political activism, and civic engagement. Without the internet, these processes would be severely limited, leading to a decline in democratic participation and the potential for authoritarianism.",
    "Psychological Impact: The internet has become an integral part of modern-day life, and its absence would have a significant psychological impact on people. People would experience feelings of isolation, disconnection, and loss of identity, as the internet has become a major source of social connection and self-expression. This could lead to increased levels of mental health problems such as depression and anxiety."
