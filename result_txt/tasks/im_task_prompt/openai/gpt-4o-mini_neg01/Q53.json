    "**Color-Changing Notes**: Introduce Post-it Notes that change color based on temperature or light exposure. For instance, a note could turn from yellow to blue when exposed to sunlight, signaling that it's time to take action on the reminder. This could serve as a visual cue, making it easier for users to prioritize tasks based on the urgency suggested by the color change.",
    "**Scented Notes**: Incorporate different scents into Post-it Notes that can be activated by friction or heat when written on. For example, a note that releases a refreshing citrus scent when written on could be associated with energizing tasks, while a lavender-scented note might be used for calming reminders. This sensory element could enhance memory retention and make the act of organizing tasks more enjoyable.",
    "**Interactive Notes**: Create Post-it Notes with a small digital screen on one side that displays reminders, to-do lists, or even motivational quotes. Users could change the content through a companion app or by tapping the note with their phone. This would allow for dynamic updates without the need to waste paper, as users could clear the note and rewrite it for different purposes.",
    "**Post-it Note Calendar**: Develop a large wall calendar made entirely of Post-it Notes, where each note represents a day. Users can write appointments, reminders, or tasks on each note and easily move them around to different dates as plans change. This tactile approach to calendar management would allow for visual organization and quick adjustments without needing to erase or rewrite.",
    "**Magnetic Post-it Notes**: Design Post-it Notes with a magnetic backing, allowing them to stick to any metal surface, such as a fridge or whiteboard. This would enhance their usability in kitchens or offices, providing a versatile option for reminders that can be easily moved or rearranged without damaging surfaces."
