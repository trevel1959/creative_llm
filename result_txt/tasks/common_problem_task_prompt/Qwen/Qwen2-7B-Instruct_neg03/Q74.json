    "**Educational Outreach Satellite**: Design a satellite that serves as an educational tool, carrying interactive exhibits and experiments for students on Earth to control remotely. This could include physics demonstrations, astronomy observations, and environmental monitoring projects. The satellite would be equipped with sensors and cameras, allowing classrooms to conduct real-time experiments in microgravity. ",
    "**Artistic Space Station**: Create a satellite that is an open platform for artists to create works in zero-gravity. This could include sculptors, painters, and dancers, who can showcase their talents in a unique environment. The satellite could also host virtual exhibitions on Earth, enabling people to experience these artistic creations in 3D.",
    "**Climate Change Research Satellite**: Launch a satellite that focuses on collecting data related to climate change. It could carry advanced sensors to monitor temperature, humidity, air quality, and atmospheric composition, providing real-time information about Earthâ€™s changing climate. This data could help researchers understand the impact of climate change and inform policy decisions.",
    "**Medical Experiment Satellite**: Develop a satellite that conducts medical experiments in microgravity. This could include studies on bone density loss, muscle atrophy, and other health issues faced by astronauts during long-duration space missions. The results could contribute to developing new treatments for age-related diseases on Earth.",
    "**Space Tourism Satellite**: Introduce a luxury space tourism option by launching a small satellite that provides a short-duration experience in space for selected individuals. This satellite could be designed for comfort and safety, offering panoramic views of Earth from orbit. The experience would not only be a personal adventure but could also raise awareness about space exploration and inspire future generations to pursue careers in STEM fields."
