    "Complex Permits and Clearances: Construction projects often require a host of permits and clearances from various authorities and organizations. Ensuring that all permits are obtained and adhered to can be challenging, especially when dealing with stringent regulations. Construction projects may pose environmental risks and need to comply with construction regulations under multiple jurisdictions. Delays can occur if the necessary permits are not secured on time.",
    "Quality Control: Ensuring high-quality construction and materials is essential for high-rise buildings. There are many different subcontractors involved, and each must meet specific quality standards. Furthermore, proper coordination between these subcontractors is vital for maintaining quality control throughout the entire project.",
    "Timeliness and Delays: High-rise construction projects are subject to frequent delays, primarily due to material supply interruptions, labor scheduling conflicts, and unpredictable weather conditions. Delays can lead to cost overruns and lost time on the site, impacting both the construction budget and the project timeline.",
    "Safety and Worker Welfare: High-rise buildings require a significant number of workers to be simultaneously active on the same site, which can pose safety risks. Ensuring a safe work environment while efficiently managing construction activities is a major challenge. Worker welfare, including adequate rest facilities, training, and protection, is paramount to maintaining a healthy workforce.",
    "Structural Integrity: High-rise buildings need to withstand the stress exerted upon them during every stage of construction. Ensuring the structural integrity of the building is crucial for its safety and longevity. This involves comprehensive planning and engineering, as well as regular inspections and testing."
