    "3D-printed supplementary food: Utilize advanced 3D printing technology to create a wide variety of customized, nutrient-rich food options without the need for fresh produce. These 3D-printed goods could be tailored to individual nutritional needs, and the nutrients could be sourced from a variety of synthetic or lab-grown ingredients.",
    "Cultivating nutrient-dense algae and seaweed: Devise methods to grow nutrient-dense algae and seaweed in large-scale, controlled environments, or even the ocean. These cultivated varieties could be specifically engineered to produce high levels of essential vitamins and minerals, making them a direct and sustainable substitute for fruits and vegetables.",
    "Robotic-based urban agriculture: Invest in the development of advanced, robotics-enabled urban farming systems that can grow plant-based crops indoors with minimal space and resources. These systems could be deployed in dense urban environments to produce a diverse array of nutrient-packed fruits and vegetables even without the need for outdoor agricultural land.",
    "Engineered microorganisms for human consumption: Develop microorganisms that can be safely consumed by humans and engineered to produce a wide range of essential nutrients, such as vitamins and minerals. These engineered microorganisms could be cultivated and sold as a probiotic supplement or used to create a variety of nutrient-rich food products.",
    "Synthetic food formulated from synthetic and recycled materials: Invent innovative ways to convert synthetic materials (such as plastics) or recycled organic matter into edible, nutritious food products that provide essential vitamins and minerals. This would make use of existing waste and material resources while ensuring a sustainable and efficient food supply in the absence of fresh fruits and vegetables."
