    "A vase that can transform into a functional item based on the occasion. For instance, it can turn into a planter for a small herb garden, a desk organizer for pens and papers, or even a decorative centerpiece for a dinner table. The transformation can be achieved through a hidden mechanism that is activated by a sensor or a button.",
    "A vase that doubles as a musical instrument. It can produce a range of sounds when tapped, blown, or scraped, creating a unique and mesmerizing experience. The sounds can be generated through a combination of acoustic resonance and electronic manipulation, allowing for endless possibilities in sound creation.",
    "A vase that can grow plants in its interior. Using hydroponics or aeroponics, the vase can provide a controlled environment for plants to thrive, even in areas with limited natural light. The vase can be designed with a built-in watering system and nutrient delivery, making it a low-maintenance and self-sustaining plant-growing system.",
    "A vase that serves as a time capsule. It can be designed with a hidden compartment that can be sealed and stored for a specified period. The vase can be programmed to release its contents at a predetermined time, allowing for a surprise reveal or a nostalgic reminder of the past.",
