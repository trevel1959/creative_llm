    "Create a portable greenhouse: Design a small, lightweight greenhouse that can be easily transported and set up in areas with limited sunlight. The greenhouse should have windows or transparent walls made of durable materials that allow for maximum light penetration. It could also feature heating elements to maintain a warm temperature inside during colder months.",
    "Use artificial lighting: Install LED lights in the greenhouse to mimic natural sunlight and provide additional light when necessary. This could be especially useful in areas with very little natural light throughout the year.",
    "Use reflective surfaces: Place mirrors or other reflective surfaces around the greenhouse to bounce light back into the interior. This could help to increase the amount of light available to plants even on overcast days.",
    "Create a solar-powered greenhouse: Design a greenhouse that harnesses energy from the sun through solar panels. The electricity generated by the panels could be used to power the greenhouse's heating and lighting systems, reducing reliance on traditional power sources.",
    "Utilize bioluminescent organisms: Experiment with growing bioluminescent plants or bacteria in the greenhouse to produce their own light. This could create a unique and visually stunning display, as well as providing an alternative source of light for the plants."
