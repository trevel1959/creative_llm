    "Once upon a time in the enchanted forest of Whimsywood, there lived a dragon named Zephyr. Unlike other dragons, Zephyr had a peculiar problemâ€”he was extremely sneezy! Every time he tried to breathe fire, a powerful sneeze erupted, sending clouds of glittering pollen into the air. The forest critters adored him, as his sneezes created colorful rainbows and filled the skies with sparkles. However, Zephyr felt embarrassed and longed to breathe fire like his friends. One day, during a fierce storm, his sneezes accidentally created a protective barrier of shimmering pollen, saving the forest from danger. Zephyr learned that his uniqueness was his greatest strength.",
