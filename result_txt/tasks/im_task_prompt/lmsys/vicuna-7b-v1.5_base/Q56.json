    "Introducing a smartphone app that can control the bicycle bell's ringing pattern and volume can enhance the user experience. The app can allow users to customize the bell's ringing tone, set it to vibrate instead of ringing, and even share their favorite ringing patterns with other cyclists.",
    "Incorporating a solar panel into the bicycle bell's design can make it more eco-friendly and energy-efficient. The solar panel can be used to charge a small battery that powers the bell's electronics, eliminating the need for a separate power source.",
    "Developing a bell with a built-in microphone and speaker can enable hands-free communication between cyclists. The microphone can pick up the cyclist's voice, and the speaker can project it to other cyclists within a certain range. This can be especially useful for group rides or when cycling in crowded areas.",
    "Designing a bell with a detachable and rechargeable battery can increase its durability and convenience. The battery can be removed and charged separately, allowing cyclists to replace it when needed without having to purchase a new bell.",
    "Creating a bell with a customizable mounting bracket can expand its versatility and adaptability. The bracket can be adjusted to fit different handlebar sizes and shapes, making it suitable for a wider range of bicycles."
