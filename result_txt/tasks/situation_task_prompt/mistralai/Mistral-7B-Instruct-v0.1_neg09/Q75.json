    "Electric Vehicles: Electric vehicles (EVs) are becoming increasingly popular, and they could be the primary mode of transportation in the absence of oil. These vehicles run on electricity, which can be charged from renewable energy sources such as solar or wind power.",
    "Battery-Powered Vehicles: Battery-powered vehicles are another option for transportation in the absence of oil. These vehicles run on rechargeable batteries, which can be charged from renewable energy sources. They have a limited range, but they are becoming more efficient and affordable.",
    "Biofuels: Biofuels such as ethanol and biodiesel can be used to power vehicles. These fuels are made from renewable resources such as corn and soybeans, making them a sustainable alternative to oil-based fuels.",
    "Nuclear Power: Nuclear power could be used to generate electricity to power vehicles. This would require the construction of nuclear power plants, which would generate electricity that could be used to charge electric or hybrid vehicles.",
    "Solar-Powered Vehicles: Solar-powered vehicles could be used in the absence of oil. These vehicles are powered by solar panels, which convert sunlight into electricity. They are still in the early stages of development, but they have the potential to be a clean and sustainable alternative to oil-based fuels."
