    "Virtual Lamp Shade Customization: Create an app that allows users to virtually design and customize their lampshades. Users can choose from a variety of colors, shapes, and patterns to create a unique and personalized lampshade. The app can also offer a \"3D preview\" feature, allowing users to see how their design would look in real life before placing an order.",
    "Smart Lamp Shade: Develop a smart lampshade that can change color, brightness, and pattern based on the user's mood, time of day, or ambient lighting in the room. This can be achieved through the use of LED lights and a microcontroller, which can be controlled through a mobile app.",
