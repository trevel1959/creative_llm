    "**Interactive Museum Exhibits**: Design immersive, hands-on experiences that allow visitors to become part of the art, history, or science on display. For example, a \"Mystery Box\" exhibit where visitors can solve a crime by analyzing clues and piecing together a puzzle, or a \"Time Traveler's Journey\" where visitors can step into a recreated historical setting and interact with virtual characters.",
    "**Glow-in-the-Dark Mini Golf**: Create a neon-lit mini golf course with holes that change color, pattern, or even move in response to sound or movement. Players can use special glow-in-the-dark balls and clubs to navigate the course, adding an extra layer of challenge and fun.",
    "**Virtual Reality Food Tours**: Develop a VR experience that transports users to different culinary destinations around the world. Users can explore markets, try virtual foods, and interact with virtual chefs, all while learning about different cultures and cooking techniques.",
    "**Augmented Reality Scavenger Hunt**: Design an AR app that hides virtual objects, characters, or challenges throughout a designated area, such as a park or city block. Users can scan their surroundings to find and interact with the hidden content, solving puzzles or completing tasks to progress through the game.",
    "**Indoor Skydiving Simulator**: Build a large, vertical wind tunnel that simulates the experience of skydiving without the need for a plane or parachute.
