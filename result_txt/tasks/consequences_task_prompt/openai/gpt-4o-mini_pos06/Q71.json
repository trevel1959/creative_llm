    "**Economic Shifts**: With immortality, the workforce would experience dramatic changes. Traditional retirement would become obsolete, leading to potential overpopulation in the job market. This could spark innovation in job-sharing, lifelong learning, and possibly even a shift towards a more creative economy where people pursue passion projects rather than traditional career paths. However, this could also exacerbate wealth inequality, as those who can afford immortality would have a competitive advantage.",
    "**Environmental Impact**: The implications for the environment could be severe. An immortal population would put immense pressure on natural resources, potentially leading to overconsumption and depletion of the Earthâ€™s resources. This could trigger an environmental crisis, forcing humanity to find sustainable solutions or face dire consequences. Alternatively, it could lead to a renewed focus on environmental stewardship as people recognize the long-term impacts of their actions.",
    "**Psychological Effects**: The psychological consequences of immortality could be profound. While some may embrace eternal life, others could experience existential crises, depression, or a sense of ennui as they grapple with the weight of infinite time. Mental health services would need to adapt to address these new challenges, leading to a cultural shift towards valuing mental well-being as much as physical health.",
    "**Cultural Evolution**: Immortality could lead to a cultural renaissance as individuals have more time to explore art, philosophy, and science. This could result in an explosion of creativity and innovation, as people pursue lifelong learning and exploration. However, it could also lead to cultural stagnation, as ideas and traditions become overly entrenched, leading to conflicts between the immortal and those who seek change.",
    "**Family Dynamics**: The concept of family and relationships would change dramatically. Traditional life stages, such as marriage and parenting, could evolve as individuals choose to delay or forgo these milestones. This could lead to new forms of relationships, including polyamory or communal living arrangements, but it could also create challenges in family structures, as generations become less defined."
