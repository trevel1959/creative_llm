This collective creativity could break down traditional barriers in the arts, leading to unique forms of expression that are richer and more diverse.",
    "**Mental Health Revolution**: Telepathy could provide new avenues for mental health support.

Additionally, support groups could function on a deeper level, where individuals could share their struggles without the need for verbal expression, creating a safe space for healing and understanding.",
    "**Global Decision-Making and Governance**: Telepathic communication could change how societies make decisions. Leaders could tap into the collective thoughts of their constituents, gaining insight into public opinion and feelings about various issues.
