    "**Bio-engineered Trees**: Develop new strains of trees through genetic engineering that grow faster, are more resilient to pests and diseases, and can sequester carbon at a higher rate. These trees could potentially replace the lost timber and other forest products while also aiding in climate change mitigation. Confidence Score: 0.9",
    "**3D Printed Forests**: Create artificial forests using 3D printing technology, which can replicate various types of trees and plants on a large scale. This method would allow for rapid deployment and customization of forests to specific environments or climates, ensuring they can adapt to different conditions. Confidence Score: 0.85",
    "**Vertical Farming and Urban Gardens**: Implement vertical farming techniques in urban areas to grow food and produce wood products vertically, utilizing unused spaces like rooftops and walls. This would reduce the need for land clearing for agriculture and forestry, preserving natural habitats. Confidence Score: 0.9",
    "**Solar-Powered Forest Restoration**: Combine renewable energy with reforestation efforts by installing solar panels in deforested areas to power the restoration process. This could include water pumping for irrigation, monitoring systems for wildlife conservation, and machinery for planting and maintaining young trees. Confidence Score: 0.9",
    "**Eco-tourism and Conservation Bonds**: Encourage sustainable tourism practices that promote the protection and preservation of existing forests. Additionally, introduce eco-bonds where investors fund reforestation projects and receive environmental credits, creating economic incentives for conservation. Confidence Score: 0.9"
