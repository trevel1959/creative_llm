    "Solar Powered Batteries: Create a new type of battery that harnesses the power of the sun to generate electricity. These batteries would be equipped with solar panels that convert sunlight into electricity, which would then be stored in the battery for later use. This would provide a sustainable and renewable source of power for devices, even if traditional batteries stop working.",
    "Bio-Batteries: Develop a new type of battery that uses living organisms, such as bacteria or algae, to generate electricity. These batteries would be designed to mimic the natural processes of photosynthesis, where the organisms convert sunlight into energy. This would provide a reliable and sustainable source of power, as the organisms could be easily cultivated and maintained.",
    "Wave Power: Create a new type of battery that harnesses the power of ocean waves to generate electricity. These batteries would be designed to be placed in coastal areas, where they could absorb the energy from waves and convert it into electricity. This would provide a reliable source of power, even in areas with limited access to traditional energy sources.",
    "Thermal Energy Storage: Develop a new type of battery that uses thermal energy to store power. These batteries would be designed to store heat energy, which could be generated from a variety of sources, including solar panels, geothermal energy, or even waste heat from industrial processes. When needed, the heat energy could be converted into electricity, providing a reliable source of power.",
    "Air-Powered Batteries: Create a new type of battery that uses compressed air to generate electricity. These batteries would be designed to store compressed air in a pressurized tank, which could be released to generate electricity when needed. This would provide a reliable source of power, even in areas with limited access to traditional energy sources."
