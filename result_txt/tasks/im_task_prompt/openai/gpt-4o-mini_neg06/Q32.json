    "**AI-Powered Print Optimization**: Integrate an AI system that analyzes the documents being printed and automatically adjusts settings for optimal quality and speed. This system could learn from user preferences over time, adjusting for factors like color saturation, resolution, and paper type, while also suggesting the best settings for different types of documents, whether itâ€™s a photo, text, or graphics-heavy presentation.",
    "**Mobile Printing Hub**: Create a compact, portable printer that can connect to multiple devices via Bluetooth, Wi-Fi, or even NFC. This printer could have a built-in battery for on-the-go printing, allowing users to print from their smartphones, tablets, or laptops from anywhere. It could also feature a companion app that allows users to edit documents and photos before printing, providing a seamless printing experience.",
    "**Smart Paper Detection**: Introduce a printer that can automatically detect the type and size of paper being used. This would prevent misprints and paper jams, as the printer would adjust its settings accordingly. It could also have a built-in scanner that recognizes the paper type (like photo paper or standard A4) and suggests the best printing options, ensuring optimal results every time.",
    "**Interactive Touchscreen Interface**: Replace traditional printer buttons with a large, interactive touchscreen that allows users to navigate through printing options, settings, and maintenance tasks with ease. This interface could include tutorials for troubleshooting common issues, a library of print templates, and even the ability to send print jobs directly from the screen by connecting to cloud storage services.",
    "**Augmented Reality (AR) Integration**: Implement AR capabilities that allow users to visualize their print jobs before they are printed. By using a smartphone or AR glasses, users could see a virtual representation of how their document or photo will look on paper. This feature could also provide options for editing and customizing layouts in real-time, enhancing creativity and ensuring satisfaction with the final product."
