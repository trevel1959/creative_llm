    "**Wearable Object Recognition Device**: Create a wearable device, such as a bracelet or necklace, that uses advanced image recognition software to identify everyday objects. The device would connect to a smartphone app that provides audio descriptions of items in the user’s vicinity. This technology would empower visually impaired individuals to identify objects like keys, food items, or personal belongings, enhancing their ability to perform daily tasks independently.",
    "**Smart Cane with Environmental Sensors**: Innovate a smart cane embedded with environmental sensors that can detect temperature, humidity, and even air quality. This cane would not only help users navigate physical obstacles but also provide information about their surroundings, such as detecting the presence of stairs or changes in terrain. Additionally, it could sync with a mobile app to offer personalized route suggestions based on the user’s preferences and past journeys.",
    "**Interactive Braille e-Book Reader**: Design an interactive e-book reader that utilizes dynamic Braille technology to allow users to read digital content. The device would feature a touchscreen interface that converts text into Braille, enabling users to read books, articles, and other materials in real-time. The reader could also incorporate text-to-speech capabilities, allowing users to switch between reading and listening modes, providing a versatile reading experience.",
    "**Voice-Activated Home Automation System**: Develop a comprehensive home automation system that is entirely voice-activated and designed specifically for visually impaired users. This system would allow users to control lighting, temperature, appliances, and security features through simple voice commands. It could also include smart speakers that provide auditory feedback, helping users navigate their home environment more easily and safely.",
    "**Augmented Reality Learning Tool**: Create an AR-based learning tool for visually impaired students that transforms traditional educational materials into interactive, tactile experiences. This tool would use a combination of 3D-printed models and AR applications to allow students to explore subjects like science and geography through touch and audio descriptions, making learning more engaging and accessible."
