This would be particularly useful for fitness enthusiasts and outdoor adventurers.",
    "**Ergonomic Design with Adaptive Fit Technology**: Create a backpack that features an adaptive fit system, using adjustable straps and an internal frame that conforms to the user's back shape. This design would provide optimal weight distribution and comfort, reducing strain during long periods of wear. Additionally, the backpack could incorporate breathable materials and padding to enhance airflow and minimize sweating.",
    "**Built-in Safety Features**: Develop a backpack with integrated safety features such as reflective strips for visibility at night, a built-in alarm system that can be activated in emergencies, and a hidden compartment for valuables. The backpack could also include a GPS tracker that connects to a mobile app, allowing users to locate their backpack if lost or stolen, providing peace of mind for travelers and students."
