    "**Ergonomic Handle Design**: Develop a knife with a handle that conforms to the userâ€™s grip. Using 3D scanning technology, the handle could be customized for individual users, providing a comfortable and secure grip that reduces strain during prolonged use. The handle could also feature textured surfaces or materials that provide better grip when wet or greasy.",
    "**Interchangeable Blades System**: Create a knife that allows users to easily swap out blades for different cutting tasks. This system could include various types of blades (e.g., serrated, straight, or specialized blades for specific foods) that can be changed quickly and safely. Each blade could be stored in the handle, ensuring convenience and reducing the need for multiple knives in the kitchen.",
    "**Built-in Knife Sharpener**: Design a knife that incorporates a retractable sharpening mechanism within the handle. This would allow users to sharpen the blade quickly and easily without needing a separate tool. The sharpening system could be made from durable materials that can maintain a sharp edge and would be activated with a simple sliding mechanism.",
    "**Multi-Function Knife with Additional Tools**: Transform the traditional knife into a multi-tool that includes features such as a bottle opener, can opener, or even a small cutting board that folds out from the handle. This would be especially useful for camping or outdoor cooking, where space is limited, and having multiple tools at hand can enhance convenience and functionality.",
    "**Self-Cleaning Knife**: Imagine a knife with a surface treated with antimicrobial technology that actively repels bacteria and dirt. Coupled with a built-in UV light system that can be activated after use, this knife would not only stay cleaner but also help to ensure food safety. The self-cleaning feature would appeal to health-conscious consumers and those looking to minimize cross-contamination in the kitchen."
