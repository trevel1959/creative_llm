    "**Participant Recruitment and Retention**: If the experiment involves human subjects, recruiting a sufficient number of participants can be challenging. Issues may include difficulties in finding individuals who meet the criteria, low response rates, or high dropout rates. This can compromise the statistical power of the experiment and lead to biased results if the sample is not representative of the population.",
    "**Data Management and Integrity**: Handling large volumes of data can pose significant challenges, including data entry errors, loss of data, or issues with data storage and retrieval. Maintaining data integrity is crucial, as any inaccuracies can lead to flawed conclusions. Implementing robust data management systems and protocols is essential to mitigate these risks.",
    "**Interdisciplinary Collaboration Hurdles**: Large-scale scientific experiments often require collaboration among various disciplines. Miscommunication or lack of coordination between team members from different fields can lead to misunderstandings regarding methodologies, goals, and expectations. Establishing clear communication channels and regular meetings can help foster collaboration and ensure everyone is aligned.",
    "**Ethical Considerations**: Conducting a large-scale experiment may raise ethical issues, especially if it involves human or animal subjects. Potential problems include obtaining informed consent, ensuring participant confidentiality, and adhering to ethical guidelines. Failing to address these concerns can result in reputational damage and legal repercussions.",
    "**Environmental and External Factors**: Experiments can be influenced by external environmental factors, such as weather conditions, natural disasters, or geopolitical events. These factors can disrupt the experimental timeline or affect the conditions under which the experiment is conducted. Developing contingency plans and considering these variables during the planning phase can help mitigate their impact."
