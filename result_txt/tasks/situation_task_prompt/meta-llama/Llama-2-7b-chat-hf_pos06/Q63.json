    "Use a combination lock: If all keys disappeared, I would use a combination lock to secure my belongings.

I would set a unique and complex combination that is easy for me to remember but difficult for others to guess. Confidence score: 0.9",
    "Implement biometric security: If keys are no longer an option, I would invest in biometric security systems that use unique physical characteristics, such as fingerprints or facial recognition, to grant access to my belongings. This would provide an additional layer of security and make it nearly impossible for someone to gain unauthorized access. Confidence score: 0.95",
    "Utilize smart locks: Smart locks are the future of security, and they can be controlled through a smartphone app. These locks can be programmed to recognize specific individuals and grant them access, making it impossible for anyone else to gain entry.

    "Use a safe deposit box: If all keys have disappeared, I would use a safe deposit box at a bank or security company.

Additionally, the box would be located in a secure facility, making it difficult for someone to gain unauthorized access. Confidence score: 0.85",
    "Implement a keyless entry system: A keyless entry system would allow me to grant access to my belongings without the need for physical keys. This could be done through a smartphone app or a specific code that is only known to authorized individuals.
