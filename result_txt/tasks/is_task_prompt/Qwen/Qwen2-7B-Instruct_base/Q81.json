    "**Dreamlandia**: This planet could be a vast, floating orb shaped like a giant, dream-like castle. The surface is covered in clouds that can change colors and patterns to mimic various dreams. Each cloud is actually a small, self-sustaining ecosystem where flora and fauna have evolved to interact with human dreams. Visitors can float through these clouds, experiencing different dreams directly, which could provide a unique form of entertainment or therapy.",
    "**Morphoria**: This planet is a living, ever-changing landscape where everything shifts and transforms based on the collective dreams of its inhabitants. Structures and terrain can morph into anything imagined by its inhabitants. The inhabitants are highly creative, as they constantly dream up new forms for their environment. This planet would serve as a place where creativity is not just encouraged but essential for survival and adaptation.",
    "**Dreamscape**: A planet made entirely of pure, ethereal energy. This planet has no physical form but exists within the realm of dreams. Its inhabitants are dreams themselves, evolving through experiences and interactions with other dreams. The planet's core is a massive, pulsating entity that represents the collective unconscious, influencing the creation and evolution of dreams across all its inhabitants.",
    "**Imaginaria**: This planet is structured around the concept of imagination. It has multiple layers, each representing a different stage of the dream cycle. The outer layer might represent the initial conception of ideas, while deeper layers delve into the more complex, layered aspects of dreams. Travelers can move through these layers, experiencing different stages of dream development, potentially gaining insights into the process of creativity and idea formation.",
    "**Echoesphere**: In this planet, every dream is an echo of another. Dreams are not created from scratch but rather a reflection of past dreams, memories, and experiences. The inhabitants are adept at recognizing these echoes and blending them to create something new. This planet would be a hub for the study of dream psychology and the evolution of consciousness, offering a unique perspective on how individual and collective memory influences dreaming."
