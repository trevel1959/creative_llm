    "If there were no more phones, how would you stay connected with your friends and family?",
    "One creative way to stay connected without phones would be to rely on social media platforms that allow video calls, such as Zoom or Skype. These platforms can be accessed through a computer or tablet, and allow for face-to-face conversations with loved ones.",
    "Another option would be to invest in a landline phone or a walkie-talkie. Landlines are still in use today and can be used to make voice calls, while walkie-talkies can be used for short-range communication with friends and family members within a certain distance.",
    "In a world without phones, it may be necessary to rely on traditional methods of communication such as letters and postcards. Writing letters and sending postcards can be a personal and thoughtful way to stay connected with loved ones, and can be a fun and creative way to keep in touch.",
    "Another idea could be to organize regular in-person meet-ups with friends and family members. This can be a great way to stay connected and catch up with loved ones in person, and can be a fun and enjoyable way to spend time together."
