Potential problems include crop failure, soil degradation, and the spread of pests and diseases.",
    "Pests and Diseases: Organic farming relies on natural methods to control pests and diseases, which can be challenging in the absence of synthetic pesticides. Potential problems include infestations of insects, rodents, and weeds, as well as the spread of plant diseases.",
    "Water Scarcity: Access to water is essential for organic farming. Potential problems include droughts, water pollution, and the depletion of groundwater resources. These issues can make it difficult to maintain irrigation systems and can impact the overall productivity of the farm.",
    "Labor and Cost: Organic farming can be labor-intensive, and the cost of organic farming can be higher than conventional farming. Potential problems include finding skilled labor, managing labor costs, and maintaining profitability.",
    "Market Demand: Organic produce can be more expensive than conventionally grown produce, which can impact market demand. Potential problems include fluctuations in market demand, competition from conventional farms, and the need to find markets for organic produce."
