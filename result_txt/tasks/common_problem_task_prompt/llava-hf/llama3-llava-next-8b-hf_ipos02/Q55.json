    "Limited land availability: Finding suitable land for a nature conservation park can be difficult, as it must meet certain criteria such as being undisturbed, having a diverse ecosystem, and being large enough to support a variety of species. Additionally, the availability of land for conservation purposes may be limited in certain areas due to factors such as urbanization, agriculture, and infrastructure development.",
    "Conservation efforts may be met with resistance: Establishing a nature conservation park may be met with resistance from local communities or businesses that rely on the land for their livelihoods. This could lead to conflicts and challenges in terms of balancing the needs of conservation with the needs of local communities.",
    "Limited public awareness and support: Many people may not be aware of the importance of nature conservation or may not support efforts to protect wildlife and ecosystems. This could make it difficult to secure funding and garner public support for the park.",
    "Lack of trained staff: Staffing a nature conservation park can be challenging, as it requires specialized knowledge and skills in areas such as wildlife management, ecology, and conservation biology. Finding and training the necessary staff to manage the park can be a significant challenge.",
    "Inadequate infrastructure: A nature conservation park requires infrastructure such as roads, buildings, and facilities for visitors and staff. If these are not properly planned and constructed, they can negatively impact the park's ability to effectively conserve and protect wildlife and ecosystems."
