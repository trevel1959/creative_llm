    "**Human-Powered Devices**: Develop a line of gadgets that harness human energy for operation. This could include bicycles with integrated generators to charge smartphones or wearable fitness trackers that convert body movements into electrical energy.",
    "**Biological Power Sources**: Explore the use of biological materials for energy. For example, develop a device that uses the metabolic waste products from microorganisms in wastewater as a source of energy. The bacteria would produce electricity as they break down organic matter, which could then be harnessed to power the device.",
    "**Thermal Energy Harvesting**: Create wearable tech that captures heat from the environment. By using thermoelectric materials, the device can convert the difference in temperature between the skin and the surroundings into electrical power. This could be particularly useful for devices worn on the body, like watches or smart clothing.",
    "**Piezoelectric Textiles**: Design fabrics infused with piezoelectric crystals. These textiles can generate electricity when subjected to pressure or movement. They could be used to power small electronic devices, such as fitness trackers or sensors, when worn by individuals.",
    "**Solar Power with Advanced Materials**: Develop flexible solar panels that can be attached to various surfaces, like clothing or furniture. These panels would utilize advanced materials that are highly efficient at converting light into electricity, even in low-light conditions. This could enable a wide range of portable devices to be powered continuously through sunlight."
