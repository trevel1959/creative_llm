    "Hydrogen fuel cells: One alternative to oil-powered vehicles could be hydrogen fuel cells. These cells generate electricity by combining hydrogen and oxygen, producing only water as a byproduct. They could be used to power electric cars, trucks, and buses.",
    "Solar-powered vehicles: Another option could be to use solar panels to power electric vehicles. Solar panels could be installed on the roofs of vehicles or on charging stations to generate electricity.",
    "Wind-powered vehicles: Wind turbines could be used to generate electricity to power electric vehicles. This could be done by installing turbines on top of vehicles or on charging stations.",
    "Battery-powered vehicles: Battery-powered vehicles could be used as a replacement for oil-powered vehicles. These vehicles would be charged using renewable energy sources such as solar or wind power.",
    "Nuclear-powered vehicles: Nuclear power could be used to generate electricity to power electric vehicles. This could be done by installing small nuclear reactors in vehicles or on charging stations. However, this option would come with its own set of safety concerns and would require careful regulation."
