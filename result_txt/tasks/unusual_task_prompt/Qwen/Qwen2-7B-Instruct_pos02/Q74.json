    "**Smart Steering Wheel for Autonomous Vehicles**: This idea involves integrating a smart steering wheel into autonomous vehicles. The steering wheel would be equipped with advanced sensors and software that can interpret driver inputs, such as hand movements and eye tracking, to enhance safety and user experience. For instance, if the system detects that the driver is drifting out of their lane or failing to respond to visual cues, it could gently correct the vehicle's course or even take control, depending on the level of autonomy. This would not only improve safety but also provide a more intuitive interface for users transitioning from traditional driving to autonomous systems.",
    "**Steering Wheel-Based Fitness Tracker**: By incorporating sensors and algorithms into a standard steering wheel, this concept transforms a simple driving tool into a fitness monitoring device. The system could track various metrics like heart rate, calories burned, and distance traveled during commutes. Users could set fitness goals and receive real-time feedback through the dashboard display, making it easier to integrate healthy habits into daily routines. Additionally, this could potentially offer rewards or incentives based on achievement, encouraging healthier lifestyle choices.",
    "**Adaptive Steering Wheel for Accessibility**: This innovative design caters to individuals with disabilities, offering a more inclusive driving experience. The steering wheel could adapt its size, shape, and controls based on the user's specific needs, such as motor impairments or visual disabilities. Features like haptic feedback, voice commands, and adjustable controls ensure that all drivers, regardless of their abilities, can safely operate a vehicle. This would significantly expand accessibility in the automotive industry, promoting inclusivity and reducing barriers to mobility.",
    "**Virtual Reality Driving Simulator Steering Wheel**: For training purposes, especially in military or commercial aviation, a VR driving simulator steering wheel could revolutionize pilot training. By simulating real-world scenarios and conditions, this technology provides an immersive environment for pilots to practice emergency procedures, navigation, and other critical skills without the risks associated with live flight operations. This could lead to more efficient training methods, reduced costs, and safer skies.",
    "**Interactive Infotainment Steering Wheel**: This idea focuses on enhancing the infotainment experience within vehicles. The steering wheel could become a multifunctional interface, allowing for easy access to music, navigation, climate control, and other vehicle settings. Through touch-sensitive pads and intuitive gestures, drivers can interact with the system without taking their eyes off the road. Furthermore, integrating voice recognition technology enables hands-free operation, promoting safer and more convenient driving experiences. This could significantly improve the overall enjoyment and convenience of using in-car entertainment"
