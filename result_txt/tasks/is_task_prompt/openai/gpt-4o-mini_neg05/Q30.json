    "In a realm where dragons ruled the skies, there lived a peculiar dragon named Ember. Unlike his fiery kin, Ember was terrified of flames. While others soared through infernos, he hid in the shadow of the Misty Mountains, dreaming of the day he could embrace his true nature. One fateful night, a forest fire threatened the nearby village. As panic spread, Ember’s heart raced, torn between fear and courage. Summoning all his strength, he dove into the flames, using his wings to create a barrier that shielded the villagers. In that moment, he discovered that fire wasn’t just destruction—it was also a source of protection and rebirth.",
