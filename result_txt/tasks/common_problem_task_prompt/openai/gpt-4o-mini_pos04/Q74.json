    "**Rocket Malfunction**: The rocket itself could experience a malfunction during the launch phase, which could lead to catastrophic failure. Issues could arise from faulty components, software errors, or human error during the assembly and testing phases. To address this, rigorous testing protocols and quality assurance measures should be implemented, along with redundant systems that can take over if primary systems fail.",
    "**Space Debris Collision**: As the satellite ascends and reaches orbit, there is a risk of colliding with existing space debris. With thousands of pieces of debris in orbit, even a small object can cause significant damage to a satellite. To combat this, pre-launch tracking of debris and real-time monitoring during ascent can help in adjusting the satellite's trajectory to avoid potential collisions.",
    "**Communication Failure**: Once the satellite is launched, maintaining communication with it is essential for monitoring its systems and receiving data. A communication failure can occur due to interference, equipment malfunction, or misalignment of antennas. To prevent this, multiple ground stations can be established to ensure continuous contact, and redundant communication systems can be integrated into the satellite design.",
    "**Power Supply Issues**: Satellites rely on solar panels or other power sources to function properly. If there are issues with the power supply, such as panel deployment failure or insufficient sunlight exposure, the satellite may not operate as intended. To address this, the satellite design should include battery backup systems and alternative power sources, as well as comprehensive testing of solar panel deployment mechanisms.",
    "**Orbital Decay and Re-entry Risks**: Depending on the altitude and orbit, a satellite may experience orbital decay over time, leading to a risk of re-entry into the Earthâ€™s atmosphere. This could pose a danger to populated areas if the satellite were to break apart upon re-entry. To mitigate this risk, mission planners should consider de-orbiting strategies and end-of-life plans for the satellite, ensuring that it safely burns up in a controlled manner or is directed to a \"graveyard\" orbit."
