    "**Bioluminescent Insect Traps**: Develop a system that utilizes bioluminescent organisms to attract and trap insects. These organisms could be engineered to emit specific wavelengths of light that are attractive to pests, drawing them into a trap where they can be safely contained or eliminated. This approach would not only reduce pesticide use but also provide a sustainable solution for managing insect populations.",
    "**Insect-Harvesting Drones**: Design and deploy drones equipped with advanced sensors and AI-powered navigation systems to locate and collect insects. These drones could be programmed to identify specific pest species, track their movements, and target areas with high infestation rates. This technology would enable efficient and targeted insect control, minimizing environmental impact and reducing the need for chemical pesticides.",
    "**Genetically Engineered Pest-Repellent Plants**: Develop genetically modified plants that produce natural chemicals or pheromones that repel specific pest species. These plants could be engineered to release these repellents at specific times or in response to environmental cues, providing a non-toxic and sustainable way to manage pest populations. This approach would also promote biodiversity by creating a more balanced ecosystem.",
    "**Insect-Based Pest Control Services**: Establish a network of trained professionals who specialize in managing insect populations using non-toxic methods. These experts could use a combination of techniques, such as introducing beneficial insects, using physical barriers, and implementing integrated pest management strategies. This service would provide a humane and environmentally friendly solution for pest control, reducing the reliance on chemical pesticides.",
    "**Insect-Tracking and Predictive Analytics**: Develop an AI-powered system that uses machine learning algorithms to analyze data from various sources, such as weather patterns, soil moisture, and insect behavior. This system would provide early warnings for potential pest outbreaks, enabling proactive measures to be taken to prevent infestations. By predicting and preventing pest problems, this technology would reduce the need for chemical pesticides and minimize environmental impact. [/INST] "
