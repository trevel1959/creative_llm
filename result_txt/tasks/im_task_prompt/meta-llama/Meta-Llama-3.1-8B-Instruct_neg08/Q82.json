    "**Self-Cleaning Socks**: Develop a fabric treatment that repels dirt and stains, allowing the socks to be washed and reused without losing their original color or texture. This could be achieved through nanotechnology or specialized coatings.",
    "**Shape-Memory Socks**: Infuse the socks with shape-memory alloy fibers that can change shape in response to temperature changes. This would allow the socks to adapt to different activities, such as flattening for hiking or expanding for basketball.",
    "**Biometric Socks**: Incorporate biometric sensors into the socks to track vital signs like heart rate, blood pressure, and oxygen levels. This data could be synced with a wearable device or smartphone app for athletes or individuals with medical conditions.",
    "**Sustainable Socks**: Create socks made from 100% recycled materials, such as recycled plastic or repurposed textiles. This would reduce waste and minimize the environmental impact of the sock manufacturing process.",
    "**Adjustable Arch Support Socks**: Design socks with built-in arch support that can be adjusted to different levels of firmness using a hidden mechanism. This would provide customized support for individuals with different foot shapes or conditions."
