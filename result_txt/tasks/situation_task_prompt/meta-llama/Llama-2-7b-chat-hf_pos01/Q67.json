    "Cloud-based Weather Forecasting: Utilize the data collected by the remaining clouds to create a comprehensive weather forecasting system. By analyzing the patterns and movements of the remaining clouds, we can predict the weather with a high degree of accuracy. Confidence Score: 0.8",
    "Solar Radiation Monitoring: Since clouds play a crucial role in regulating the amount of solar radiation reaching the Earth's surface, we can use this data to predict weather patterns. By monitoring the amount of solar radiation received at different locations, we can accurately predict the weather. Confidence Score: 0.7",
    "Atmospheric Pressure Analysis: Analyze the changes in atmospheric pressure to predict weather patterns. Changes in atmospheric pressure can indicate the movement of weather systems, such as high and low-pressure systems, which can help predict the weather. Confidence Score: 0.6",
    "Oceanic and Hydrologic Data: Utilize data from the ocean and hydrologic systems to predict weather patterns. By analyzing the temperature, salinity, and other properties of the ocean, we can predict changes in atmospheric conditions that can affect the weather. Confidence Score: 0.5",
    "Seismic Activity Analysis: Analyze seismic activity to predict weather patterns. Seismic activity can indicate changes in the Earth's crust, which can affect the atmosphere and lead to changes in the weather. Confidence Score: 0.4"
