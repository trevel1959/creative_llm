    "**The Truth Teller's Dilemma**: I would use this power to uncover the root causes of societal issues. By forcing individuals to reveal their true intentions and motivations, I could identify the underlying problems that have been masked by lies and deception.

The booth would be equipped with a recording device, allowing me to collect and analyze the confessions, and identify patterns and trends that could inform policy decisions and social interventions.",

This would help to restore trust in institutions and promote a culture of accountability.",
