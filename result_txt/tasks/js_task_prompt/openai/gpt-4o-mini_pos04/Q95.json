    "**Aquatic Amphibious Oasis**:    This habitat combines both aquatic and terrestrial environments, allowing amphibians like frogs, newts, and turtles to thrive. The design includes a large, clear water feature that mimics a natural pond, surrounded by lush vegetation and rocky outcrops. Specialized areas with varying humidity levels provide the perfect conditions for different species. The habitat features a submerged viewing area where visitors can observe the animals swimming and interacting in their environment. Educational signage explains the life cycles of amphibians and the impact of climate change on their habitats.",
    "**Desert Eco-Dome**:    This innovative habitat simulates a desert ecosystem within a climate-controlled dome, allowing visitors to experience the unique adaptations of desert-dwelling animals. The dome includes sand dunes, rocky outcrops, and cacti, all designed to replicate arid environments. Animals such as meerkats, fennec foxes, and various reptiles thrive in this space. The habitat is equipped with interactive technology that demonstrates how these animals survive in extreme conditions, and it also features a cooling mist system that creates microclimates for specific species.",
    "**Subterranean Exploration Zone**:    Inspired by the underground habitats of animals like moles and burrowing owls, this habitat offers a series of tunnels and chambers for visitors to explore. The design includes a simulated underground environment with soil, roots, and small burrows. Visitors can crawl through transparent tunnels to observe the animals in their underground habitats, providing a unique perspective on their behaviors. Educational exhibits explain the importance of soil ecosystems and the role of burrowing animals in aerating the ground and promoting plant growth.",
    "**Tidal Wetlands Sanctuary**:    This habitat replicates a coastal tidal wetland, complete with salt marshes, mudflats, and mangroves. It is designed for species such as shorebirds, crabs, and fish. The sanctuary features a dynamic water system that mimics tidal changes, allowing for a diverse range of habitats within a single space. Elevated boardwalks provide visitors with access to different zones while minimizing disturbance to the animals. Interactive displays educate visitors about the significance of wetlands in coastal ecosystems and the threats they face from development and climate change.",
    "**The Forest Floor Discovery Zone**:    This habitat focuses on the often-overlooked forest floor ecosystem, highlighting species such as insects, small mammals, and ground-dwelling birds. The design includes a multi-layered environment with leaf litter, logs, and rocks, creating a rich habitat for exploration. The area is equipped with hidden cameras and sensors that allow visitors to observe the animals in real-time through a digital interface. Educational programs focus on the importance of biodiversity and the roles these animals play in their ecosystems, encouraging visitors to appreciate the often-hidden life beneath the trees."
