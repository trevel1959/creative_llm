    "Virtual Reality Keyboard: Create a virtual reality keyboard that allows users to type on a virtual surface that appears on their desk or table. The keyboard would be projected using a high-resolution projector and tracked using a depth sensor, allowing for precise and accurate typing. This would be especially useful for people who have difficulty typing on traditional keyboards due to hand or finger mobility issues. Confidence Score: 0.8",
    "Holographic Keyboard: Design a holographic keyboard that projects a 3D keyboard into mid-air, allowing users to type by simply tapping on the holographic keys. The keyboard would use laser technology to create a precise and responsive typing experience. This would be a unique and futuristic way to type and would be particularly useful for people who are accustomed to using touchscreen devices. Confidence Score: 0.9",
    "Brain-Computer Interface Keyboard: Develop a brain-computer interface (BCI) keyboard that allows users to type by simply thinking about the letters they want to type. The keyboard would use electroencephalography (EEG) sensors to detect brain activity and translate it into typed characters. This would be a revolutionary way to type and could potentially be used by people with severe physical disabilities. Confidence Score: 0.95",
    "Shape-Shifting Keyboard: Create a keyboard that can change its shape and layout based on the user's preferences. The keyboard would use a combination of flexible materials and actuators to change its shape, allowing users to customize their typing experience. For example, a user could switch between a standard QWERTY layout and a split keyboard layout for easier typing on their lap. Confidence Score: 0.85",
    "Interactive Keyboard Tattoo: Design a keyboard tattoo that can be worn on the skin like a temporary tattoo. The tattoo would contain a matrix of sensors that can detect finger movements and translate them into typed characters. This would be a unique and fun way to type and could potentially be used by people who want a more playful and interactive typing experience. Confidence Score: 0.75"
