    "Navigation: Hikers should be familiar with the trail map and be able to navigate the trail properly. It's easy to get lost in unfamiliar terrain, especially if visibility is low. Hikers should carry a map, compass, and GPS device and know how to use them.",
    "Wildlife Encounters: Hikers may encounter wildlife along the trail, which can be dangerous if the animals feel threatened. It's important to know how to respond to wildlife encounters and to carry bear spray in areas where bears are known to be present.",
    "Equipment Malfunction: Hikers should ensure that their equipment is in good working order before starting the hike. A broken backpack, a malfunctioning stove, or a damaged tent can lead to serious problems on the trail. Regularly inspecting and maintaining equipment can help prevent these issues.",
    "Insects and Plants: Hikers should be aware of the insects and plants they may encounter on the trail. Insects such as ticks and mosquitoes can transmit diseases, while plants such as poison ivy and poison oak can cause skin irritation. Hikers should carry insect repellent and know how to identify and avoid poisonous plants."
