    "**Digital Wallets**: I'd rely on digital wallets like Apple Pay, Google Pay, or Samsung Pay, which use near-field communication (NFC) technology to enable contactless payments. These wallets store credit or debit card information securely, allowing users to make transactions by tapping their device on a payment terminal. (Confidence score: 0.9)",
    "**Cryptocurrencies**: I'd turn to cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin, Ethereum, or Litecoin, which use decentralized ledgers (blockchains) to record transactions. These digital currencies can be stored in secure digital wallets and used to make payments online or in-person. (Confidence score: 0.8)",
    "**Bartering**: I'd focus on bartering, exchanging goods or services without using money. This could be done through online platforms, local communities, or even in-person trades. For example, a baker might exchange bread for a massage therapist's services. (Confidence score: 0.7)",
    "**Time Banking**: I'd participate in time banking, where individuals exchange time and skills rather than money. Members earn \"time credits\" by providing services, which can be redeemed for other services offered by community members. This system promotes social connections and community engagement. (Confidence score: 0.6)",
    "**Token-Based Systems**: I'd use token-based systems, where physical or digital tokens represent a unit of exchange. For instance, a community might use tokens made from recycled materials or digital tokens stored on a mobile app. These tokens could be earned or purchased and used to acquire goods and services. (Confidence score: 0.5)"
