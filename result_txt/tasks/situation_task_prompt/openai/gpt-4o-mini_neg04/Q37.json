    "**Retro-Bike**: This bicycle would have a special gearing system that allows it to only move in reverse. The handlebars would be designed to be turned in the opposite direction, and the bike would be equipped with a rearview mirror to help steer. The frame would be lightweight yet sturdy, with an emphasis on balance to ensure stability while moving backward. Riders could also attach a small trailer for carrying belongings, designed to follow smoothly as they pedal in reverse.",
    "**Backtrack Shoes**: These innovative shoes would feature a unique sole that propels the wearer backward. Using a combination of lightweight materials and spring-loaded mechanisms, each step would push the user in reverse. The shoes would have built-in gyroscopic sensors to help maintain balance and prevent falls. They could also include a small display that shows the distance traveled and time taken, allowing users to track their backward journeys.",
    "**Reverse Segway**: A modified version of the popular Segway, this vehicle would be designed solely for backward travel. It would feature a rotating platform that allows the rider to face forward while moving in reverse. The handlebars would control speed and direction, and the device would include a built-in navigation system that helps users plot backward routes through urban environments. Safety features would include lights and alarms to alert pedestrians and other vehicles.",
    "**Backpack-Powered Glider**: This concept involves a lightweight glider that attaches to a specially designed backpack. The glider would have wings that fold out and allow the user to \"fly\" backward by using a combination of body weight and a small motorized propeller. The backpack would contain the control system and battery, enabling the user to navigate through the air while facing forward, even though they are moving in reverse. This would be ideal for scenic views or exploring areas with difficult terrain.",
    "**Reverse-Powered Skateboard**: This skateboard would have a motor that only allows it to move backward. Riders would control their speed with a handheld remote, which would also include a brake function for quick stops. The board would be equipped with LED lights that illuminate the path behind them, making it safer to ride at night. Additionally, it could feature a retractable kickstand that allows the skateboard to stand upright when not in use, preventing it from rolling away."
