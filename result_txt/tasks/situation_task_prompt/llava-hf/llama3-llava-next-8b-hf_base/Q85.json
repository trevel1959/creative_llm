    "Quantum Cryptocurrency: Another option would be to store information using quantum cryptocurrency, which is a form of secure digital currency that uses quantum computers to store and transfer data. Quantum cryptocurrency would ensure that the data is secured from hackers, as it would only be accessible using a quantum computer. The cryptocurrency could also be backed by a network of quantum computers, making it even more secure.",
    "Time Capsules: One could also use time capsules, where digital data is encrypted and placed in a physical container that is sealed and time-stamped. The time capsules could be buried or stored in secure locations, where they would remain accessible in the future.",
    "Optical Disc Storage: Another option would be to store digital data on optical discs, such as CDs or DVDs, which have a longer shelf life than hard drives or other digital storage devices. The discs could be stored in a safe location, such as a vault or a secure storage unit, where they would remain protected from damage or loss.",
    "Distributed P2P Network: Another option would be to store digital data on a peer-to-peer network, where multiple individuals or organizations have copies of the data stored on their devices. This way, if one copy is lost or damaged, the other copies would still remain accessible.",
    "DNA Encoding: Another option would be to store digital data on DNA sequences, which have a much longer shelf life compared to digital devices or optical discs. DNA could be encoded with digital data and stored in a secure, temperature and humidity-controlled environment, where it would remain protected from damage or loss."
