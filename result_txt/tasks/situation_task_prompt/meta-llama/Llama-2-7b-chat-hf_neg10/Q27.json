    "DIY Thermal Mass System: Create a thermal mass system by utilizing everyday materials like concrete, brick, or stone to absorb and release heat. This system works by incorporating these materials into the building's structure, such as installing concrete slabs in the walls or floors, or using brick or stone to build a radiant heating system. When the heaters and air conditioners stop working, the thermal mass system will help regulate the indoor temperature by absorbing and releasing heat, maintaining a comfortable temperature.",
    "Greenhouse Windows: Install greenhouse windows that can be opened and closed to control the amount of sunlight entering the room. By opening the windows during the day, the greenhouse effect will allow natural light and heat to enter, while closing them at night will help retain the heat. This method is energy-efficient and can be used in combination with other temperature regulation techniques.",
    "Insulation Blankets: Use insulation blankets to cover windows, doors, and walls to reduce heat loss. These blankets are designed to trap air and keep it warm, providing an additional layer of insulation. They can be made from materials like wool, cotton, or synthetic fibers and can be easily removed when the heaters and air conditioners are working again.",
    "Natural Ventilation: Implement natural ventilation techniques like operable windows, vents, and clerestory windows to allow fresh air to enter the room. By opening windows on opposite sides of the room, a cross breeze can be created, providing a cooling effect. This method is energy-efficient and can be used in combination with other temperature regulation techniques.",
    "Solar Chimneys: Design a solar chimney that harnesses the power of the sun to heat the room. The chimney is made of a dark-colored material that absorbs sunlight and heats up the air inside. As the air rises, it creates a convection current that pulls in cooler air from outside, which is then heated by the solar chimney. This method is energy-efficient and can be used in combination with other temperature regulation techniques."
