    "**UV-Protective Hair Cap:** Design a hair cap made of lightweight, breathable, and UV-resistant materials. The cap could be designed with a visor to shade the forehead, offering extra protection against the sun's rays. It could also feature adjustable straps for a comfortable fit, and possibly have a small opening at the back to accommodate a ponytail or braid.",
    "**Reflective Bandana:** Create a bandana that not only covers the head but also reflects sunlight away from the scalp. The bandana could be made from a material with high reflectivity, such as silver or white reflective fabric, and can be easily tied around the head in various styles, providing both sun protection and a stylish accessory.",
    "**Sunscreen Shampoo and Conditioner:** Develop a shampoo and conditioner infused with sunscreen ingredients like zinc oxide or titanium dioxide. These products would coat the scalp when applied, offering an additional layer of sun protection. They would be gentle on the skin and could come in various fragrances to enhance personal grooming routines.",
    "**Customizable Sunscreen Spray:** Invent a spray-on sunscreen specifically designed for the scalp. The spray could be applied directly to the hairline and scalp, ensuring even coverage without the need for messy application or the risk of hair product buildup. The spray could include a pleasant scent and come in a convenient, portable bottle.",
    "**Innovative Hat Design:** Create a hat with a unique design that offers maximum sun protection while still being fashionable. This could involve a wide-brimmed hat with an adjustable inner liner made from a UV-blocking material, or a hat with a retractable visor that can be extended or retracted depending on the intensity of the sun. The hat could also incorporate ventilation holes to prevent overheating, making it suitable for various outdoor activities."
