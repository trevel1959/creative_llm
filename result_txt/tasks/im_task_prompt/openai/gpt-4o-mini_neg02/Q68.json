    "**Smartphone Integration**: Develop a companion app that syncs with the calculator via Bluetooth. This app could store previous calculations, provide detailed explanations of complex operations, and even generate graphs based on the input data. Users could also receive notifications for reminders or important dates related to their calculations, enhancing their productivity.",
    "**Augmented Reality (AR) Interface**: Create an AR feature that allows users to visualize mathematical problems in a 3D space. By pointing their smartphone camera at a flat surface, users could see geometric shapes, graphs, or equations projected in real-time. This interactive approach would make learning math concepts more engaging and intuitive.",
    "**Customizable Themes and Layouts**: Allow users to personalize the calculator interface with different themes, colors, and layouts. This could include options for large buttons for those with visual impairments, or a minimalistic design for users who prefer a clean interface. Users could also save their preferred layouts for quick access, making the tool more user-friendly.",
    "**Math Tutor Mode**: Incorporate an educational mode that not only performs calculations but also explains the steps involved in solving a problem. This feature would be beneficial for students learning new concepts, as it would help them understand the reasoning behind each step. The calculator could provide hints and tips for similar problems, acting as a personal math tutor.",
    "**Integrated Financial Planning Tools**: Enhance the calculator with built-in financial functions, such as budgeting tools, loan calculators, and investment analysis. Users could input their financial data, and the calculator would provide insights, projections, and advice on savings and investments. This would make it a valuable tool for both personal and professional financial planning."
