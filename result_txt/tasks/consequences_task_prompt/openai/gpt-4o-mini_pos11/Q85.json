People could trade their dreams with others, experiencing different perspectives and emotions.

This exchange could foster empathy and understanding, as individuals experience the lives and subconscious thoughts of others.",

By analyzing the visual and emotional content of a patient's dreams, therapists could gain insights into their subconscious struggles and desires. This method could enhance traditional talk therapy, allowing for deeper discussions about the meaning behind dreams and their relation to waking life. It could also provide a safe space for patients to confront their fears or traumas in a controlled environment."
