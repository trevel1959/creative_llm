    "Use the sun and stars: One way to keep track of time without clocks or watches is to use the position of the sun and stars. By observing the position of the sun in the sky, you can estimate the time of day. Additionally, by identifying specific stars and their positions, you can estimate the time of night.",
    "Use a sundial: A sundial is a device that uses the position of the sun to indicate the time of day. It is a simple and effective way to keep track of time without clocks or watches.",
    "Use a water clock: A water clock, also known as clepsydra, is a device that uses the flow of water to measure time. You can use a bucket or other container to measure the amount of water that flows through a hole in a certain amount of time.",
    "Use a light-sensitive device: Some devices, such as a light-sensitive resistor or capacitor, can be used to measure the amount of light that falls on them. By using these devices, you can estimate the time of day based on the amount of light that falls on them.",
    "Use a sound-based device: You can also use sound-based devices, such as a bell or a chime, to keep track of time. By setting up a schedule of when the sounds should occur, you can estimate the time of day."
