    "**Regulatory Compliance**: Launching a satellite requires adherence to various international and national regulations, including space debris mitigation, frequency allocation, and orbital slot agreements. Failure to comply can result in fines, delays, or even the cancellation of the launch. To address this, a dedicated legal and compliance team should be involved from the early stages of the project to ensure all necessary permits and agreements are in place.",
    "**Budget Overruns**: The costs associated with satellite launches can escalate quickly due to unforeseen expenses, design changes, or delays. This can jeopardize the project's viability. To counteract this, it is essential to establish a realistic budget with contingency funds and to conduct regular financial reviews to track spending against the budget.",
    "**Weather Conditions**: Launch windows can be severely affected by adverse weather conditions, such as high winds, storms, or lightning. This could lead to delays or even the need to scrub a launch entirely. A solution would be to have flexible launch schedules and to invest in advanced weather forecasting technology to make informed decisions leading up to the launch.",
    "**Launch Site Issues**: The chosen launch site could present logistical challenges, such as accessibility, infrastructure limitations, or geopolitical instability. These issues can hinder the preparation and execution of the launch. Conducting thorough site assessments and having contingency plans for alternative launch sites can help mitigate these risks.",
    "**Public Perception and Communication**: The launch of a satellite can attract public attention, and any negative incidents (like a launch failure) can lead to public outcry or distrust in space initiatives. To address this, a proactive communication strategy should be implemented, including public engagement initiatives, transparent reporting, and educational outreach to explain the mission's benefits and safety measures."
