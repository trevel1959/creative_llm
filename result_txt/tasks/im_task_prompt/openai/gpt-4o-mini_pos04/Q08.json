    "**Self-Cleaning Technology**: Introduce a self-cleaning feature that uses UV-C light or ozone to sanitize the interior of the refrigerator regularly. This technology could help eliminate bacteria and odors without the need for harsh chemicals, ensuring a cleaner environment for food storage. Users could schedule cleaning cycles or activate them with a simple button press.",
    "**Modular Shelving System**: Design a modular shelving system that allows users to customize the layout of their refrigerator. Users could easily adjust shelf heights, add or remove compartments, and create specialized sections for different types of food (e.g., fruits, vegetables, dairy). This flexibility would maximize space utilization and improve organization.",
    "**Integrated Beverage Dispenser**: Create a built-in beverage dispenser that can serve chilled drinks directly from the refrigerator. Users could choose from various beverage options, such as flavored water, iced tea, or smoothies, and the dispenser could be programmed to mix and serve drinks on demand. This feature would enhance convenience and promote healthier beverage choices.",
    "**Energy Efficiency Dashboard**: Implement an energy efficiency dashboard that provides real-time feedback on the refrigerator's energy consumption. This dashboard could include tips for reducing energy usage, such as optimal temperature settings and best practices for loading the fridge. Users could monitor their energy savings over time and receive rewards for meeting energy-saving goals.",
    "**Augmented Reality (AR) Recipe Assistant**: Develop an augmented reality feature that allows users to scan items in their refrigerator and receive recipe suggestions based on what they have. Using a smartphone or AR glasses, users could visualize recipes, cooking instructions, and even portion sizes while standing in front of the fridge. This interactive experience would encourage culinary creativity and reduce food waste."
