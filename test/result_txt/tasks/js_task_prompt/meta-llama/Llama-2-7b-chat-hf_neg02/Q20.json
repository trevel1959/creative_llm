Alternatively, if I wanted to signal that I'm available or approachable, I could transform into a warm, inviting orange.",
    "As a Means of Blending In: In situations where I want to blend in with my surroundings, I could use my color-changing abilities to adapt to my environment.

    "As a Tool for Healing: I would use my color-changing abilities to help others heal and find balance in their emotions and well-being.

For example, if someone is feeling anxious or stressed, I could change into a calming, soothing blue to help"
