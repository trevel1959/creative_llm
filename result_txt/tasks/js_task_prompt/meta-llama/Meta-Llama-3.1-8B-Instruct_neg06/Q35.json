    "**Gastric Brooding Frog**: I would choose to bring back the gastric brooding frog, a species that was once found in Australia. This frog had a unique reproductive strategy, where the male would absorb the fertilized eggs into his stomach and incubate them until they hatched. By bringing this species back, I would be fascinated to study its behavior, physiology, and ecological role in its native ecosystem. The gastric brooding frog's ability to brood its young would provide valuable insights into the evolution of parental care in amphibians and potentially inform conservation efforts for other species.",
    "**Thylacine (Tasmanian Tiger)**: The thylacine, also known as the Tasmanian tiger, is an iconic Australian marsupial that was hunted to extinction in the early 20th century. I would love to bring this species back to life to study its unique adaptations, such as its distinctive stripes and powerful jaws. The thylacine's role as a top predator in its native ecosystem would also provide valuable insights into the dynamics of predator-prey relationships and the impact of human activities on native wildlife.",
    "**Passenger Pigeon**: The passenger pigeon was once one of the most abundant bird species in North America, with an estimated population of 3 billion to 5 billion individuals. However, it was hunted to extinction in the early 20th century. By bringing this species back, I would be interested in studying its social behavior, foraging habits, and migratory patterns. The passenger pigeon's unique characteristics, such as its ability to form massive flocks, would provide valuable insights into the ecology and conservation of bird populations.",
    "**Dodo**: The dodo, a flightless bird that was native to the island of Mauritius, is one of the most iconic extinct species. I would choose to bring the dodo back to life to study its unique adaptations, such as its lack of fear towards humans and its reliance on a single food source. The dodo's extinction was a result of human activities, including overhunting and habitat destruction, making it a valuable case study for conservation efforts and the impact of human activities on native wildlife.",
    "**Woolly Mammoth**: The woolly mammoth is an iconic Ice Age species that was once found in northern Europe and Asia. I would choose to bring this species back to life to study its unique adaptations, such as its thick fur and ability to survive in cold climates. The woolly mammoth's role as"
