    "Aquaponics: Incorporate fish farming into the organic farm by using the waste from the fish to fertilize crops. This method is highly sustainable and can increase crop yields.",
    "Vertical Farming: Build a multi-story farm to maximize space and use hydroponics or aeroponics to grow crops. This method is ideal for urban areas with limited land available.",
    "Biodynamic Farming: Use natural preparations and compost to promote soil health and biodiversity. This method is holistic and can lead to more resilient and healthy crops.",
    "Permaculture: Design the farm to mimic natural ecosystems, using a variety of plants and animals to create a self-sustaining system. This method is ideal for small-scale farming and can create a diverse and thriving ecosystem.",
    "Hydroponics: Use a soilless growing system to grow crops in water rather than soil. This method is ideal for growing a wide variety of crops and can use significantly less water than traditional farming methods."
