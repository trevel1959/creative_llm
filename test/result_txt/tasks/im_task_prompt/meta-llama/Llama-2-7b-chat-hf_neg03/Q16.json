    "Smart Hairbrush: Create a hairbrush that can detect and analyze the health of your hair and scalp. It can detect signs of dandruff, split ends, and other hair problems, and provide personalized recommendations for hair care. The brush could also include a built-in scalp massager for added relaxation.",
    "Hairbrush with Built-In Heating/Cooling: Develop a hairbrush with temperature control features. This would allow users to adjust the heat or cooling level of the brush to suit their hair type and needs. For example, those with dry or damaged hair could use a cooling setting, while those with oily hair could use a heating setting.",
    "Interactive Hairbrush: Create a hairbrush that responds to voice commands or gestures. Users could ask the brush to brush their hair in a specific pattern, or use hand gestures to control the brush's movement. This could be especially helpful for people with mobility or dexterity issues.",
    "Hairbrush with Built-In Straightening/Curling Iron: Design a hairbrush with a built-in straightening or curling iron feature. This would allow users to style their hair without needing to use separate tools, saving time and space. The brush could have different heat settings for different hair types and styles.",
    "Augmented Reality Hairbrush: Create a hairbrush with an augmented reality (AR) display. The brush could show users how to style their hair, with virtual tutorials and guides appearing on the brush's screen. This could be especially helpful for people who are new to hair styling or want to learn new techniques. The AR display could also show users how their hair will look after styling, allowing them to make adjustments on the fly."
