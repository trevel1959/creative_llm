    "**Smart Aroma Diffuser Alarm Clock**: Combine an alarm clock with an aroma diffuser that releases essential oils at the set wake-up time. Users could select scents that promote alertness, such as citrus or peppermint, or calming scents like lavender for a soothing wake-up experience. This feature could also include a timer for diffusing scents throughout the night to improve sleep quality.",
    "**Interactive Wake-Up Challenge**: Instead of a simple beep, this alarm clock could require users to complete a short interactive challenge to turn it off. For example, it could feature a mini puzzle, a math problem, or even a short memory game. This would engage the brain and encourage users to be more alert when waking up.",
    "**Personalized Voice Messages**: Allow users to record personalized wake-up messages that play when the alarm goes off. This could be a motivational quote, a reminder of the day’s goals, or even a message from a loved one. The clock could also include an option to play ambient sounds or music that users can select based on their preferences.",
    "**Sleep Cycle Tracker**: Incorporate a sleep cycle monitoring feature that uses sensors to track the user’s sleep patterns. The alarm clock could then wake the user during the lightest sleep phase within a specified window of time, ensuring they feel more refreshed and less groggy. This could be paired with an app that provides insights into sleep quality and tips for improvement.",
    "**Physical Movement Alarm**: Create an alarm clock that requires physical movement to turn it off. This could involve rolling out of bed to hit a button on a separate unit placed across the room, or doing a set number of jumping jacks or stretches. This would encourage users to get out of bed and get their blood flowing, making it less likely they’ll hit snooze."
