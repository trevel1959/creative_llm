    "\"EnerGenie\" - A type of energy that is generated from organic waste such as food scraps, paper, and plastic bottles. This energy can be used to power homes, businesses, and even entire cities. The EnerGenie system would involve collecting waste in designated areas and using advanced technology to convert it into usable energy. This would not only help reduce waste but also provide a sustainable source of energy for communities.",
    "\"SolarSpark\" - A type of energy that harnesses the power of solar rays and converts them into a form of energy that can be stored and used when needed. SolarSpark could be used to power homes, vehicles, and even space shuttles. The technology behind SolarSpark would involve using specialized materials to capture and store solar energy in a compact and efficient manner.",
    "\"GeoWave\" - A type of energy that is generated from the movement of tectonic plates beneath the Earth's surface. GeoWave could be harnessed to generate electricity and heat for buildings and industries. The technology behind GeoWave would involve drilling deep into the Earth's crust to access the hot magma beneath and using it to generate steam, which can then be used to produce electricity.",
    "\"WindWise\" - A type of energy that is generated from wind turbines placed in strategic locations around the world. WindWise could be used to power homes, businesses, and even entire cities. The technology behind WindWise would involve developing advanced wind turbine designs that are more efficient and reliable than current models.",
    "\"NeuralFlow\" - A type of energy that is generated from the flow of electrical impulses within the human brain. NeuralFlow could be used to power electronic devices and even entire cities. The technology behind NeuralFlow would involve developing advanced neural interfaces that can read and interpret the electrical signals within the brain and convert them into a usable form of energy. While this idea may seem far-fetched, advances in neuroscience and technology could make it a possibility in the future."
