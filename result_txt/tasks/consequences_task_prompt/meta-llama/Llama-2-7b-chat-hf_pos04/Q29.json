    "Overwhelming Information Overload: With the ability to remember everything read, humans would be bombarded with an immense amount of information, making it challenging to process and retain any significant knowledge. The sheer volume of data would be overwhelming, causing mental fatigue and difficulty in focusing on important information.",
    "Loss of Personal Identity: The constant retention of every memory would blur the lines between personal experiences and external knowledge, leading to a loss of individuality. Humans would struggle to differentiate between their own memories and those acquired through reading, resulting in a loss of personal identity.",
    "Ethical Dilemmas: The ability to remember everything would raise ethical concerns, such as the inability to forget traumatic events or painful experiences. This could lead to emotional distress and an inability to move on from past traumas, causing long-term psychological damage.",
    "Lack of Creativity: With the constant retention of information, humans may struggle to generate new ideas or think creatively. The reliance on pre-existing knowledge would stifle innovation and creativity, as there would be little room for original thought or exploration.",
    "Social Isolation: The inability to forget would lead to social isolation, as humans would become overwhelmed by their own memories and the memories of others. This could result in difficulty forming and maintaining meaningful relationships, as the constant barrage of memories would make it challenging to connect with others on a deeper level."
