    "**Eco-Conscious Invitations**: Traditional paper invitations can contribute to deforestation and waste. To address this, couples can explore digital invitation options, which not only save paper but also allow for easy updates and RSVPs. For those who prefer physical invitations, using recycled paper or seed paper (which can be planted after use) can be a creative and sustainable alternative. Couples can also encourage guests to RSVP online to reduce the number of printed materials.",
    "**Locally Sourced Catering**: Catering can be a significant source of waste and carbon emissions due to transportation and food waste. Couples can solve this by partnering with local farms and vendors to provide seasonal, organic, and locally sourced food. This not only supports the local economy but also ensures fresher ingredients. To further reduce waste, couples can work with caterers to create a plan for leftover food, such as donating it to local shelters or composting.",
    "**Eco-Friendly Decor**: Traditional wedding decor often involves single-use items that end up in landfills. To mitigate this, couples can opt for reusable decorations, such as renting items instead of purchasing them. Additionally, using potted plants, which guests can take home as favors, or biodegradable materials can enhance the eco-friendly theme. Incorporating natural elements like flowers from local growers or using fabric backdrops can also create a beautiful atmosphere without harming the environment.",
    "**Transportation Logistics**: Guests traveling to the wedding venue can contribute to a larger carbon footprint. Couples can encourage carpooling or provide shuttles for guests to minimize the number of vehicles. Choosing a venue that is easily accessible by public transport or located near hotels can also reduce the need for long-distance travel. Couples might even consider a destination wedding that promotes eco-tourism and supports local communities.",
    "**Sustainable Attire Choices**: The wedding dress and bridal party attire can be another area where sustainability is often overlooked. Couples can consider renting attire instead of purchasing new garments or opting for second-hand options. Supporting designers who prioritize sustainable practices, such as using organic fabrics or ethical labor, can also be a way to make eco-conscious choices. Additionally, encouraging guests to wear outfits they already own or to shop second-hand can further promote a sustainable ethos."
