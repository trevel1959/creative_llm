    "Scent-sational Journey: Create a candle that takes customers on a fragrant journey with different scents for each stage of the candle's burn. For example, the first third could have a fresh, citrusy scent, the second third could have a floral, romantic scent, and the final third could have a warm, spicy scent.",
    "Customizable Coordinates: Offer a candle that allows customers to choose their own coordinates to be featured on the candle's label. Customers could choose their hometown, a special place they've visited, or a place they've always wanted to go. This adds a personal touch and makes the candle a unique gift or keepsake.",
    "Time-Traveling Tapers: Create a candle that changes scent over time, evoking memories of different eras or places. For example, the candle could start with a light, airy scent reminiscent of a summer day, gradually becoming richer and more spicy as the wax burns, representing the passage of time.",
    "Mood Lighting: Develop a candle that changes color based on the mood of the user. For example, a blue candle could turn green when the user is feeling calm and relaxed, while a red candle could turn yellow when the user is feeling energized and motivated. This adds an interactive element to the candle-burning experience.",
    "Interactive Art: Create a candle that doubles as a work of art. The candle could have a unique shape or design, and the wax could be colored or patterned to create a beautiful, one-of-a-kind piece. Customers could enjoy the candle's aesthetic appeal while it burns, and the melted wax could be saved as a keepsake after the candle is finished."
