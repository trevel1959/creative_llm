    "**Aquatic Ecosystem Collapse**: The scarcity of water would lead to a catastrophic collapse of aquatic ecosystems, causing a ripple effect throughout the food chain. Fish populations would decline, and with them, the livelihoods of communities dependent on fishing and aquaculture. The loss of these ecosystems would also result in the extinction of countless species, compromising the planet's biodiversity. (Confidence score: 0.9)",
    "**Global Food Crisis**: Water scarcity would severely impact agriculture, leading to reduced crop yields and food shortages.

This would result in mass migrations, as people seek out areas with more abundant water supplies, straining local resources and infrastructure. (Confidence score: 0.9)",
    "**Economic Contraction and Social Unrest**: Water scarcity would have a profound impact on the global economy, as industries reliant on water, such as manufacturing and energy production, would be severely affected. This would lead to widespread job losses, economic contraction, and social unrest, as people struggle to adapt to the new reality. (Confidence score: 0.8)",
    "**Human Health Impacts**: The scarcity of water would lead to a rise in water-borne diseases, as people are forced to rely on contaminated or polluted sources. This would have severe health consequences, particularly for vulnerable populations like the elderly, young children, and those with compromised immune systems. (Confidence score: 0.9)"
