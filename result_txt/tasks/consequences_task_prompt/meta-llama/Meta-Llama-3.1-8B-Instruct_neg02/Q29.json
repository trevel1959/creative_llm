    "**Information Overload**: With the ability to recall every piece of information they've ever read, humans would be overwhelmed by the sheer volume of data. They would struggle to prioritize and filter out irrelevant information, leading to mental fatigue and decreased productivity.",
    "**Loss of Original Thought**: If humans could recall every piece of information they've ever read, they might struggle to come up with original ideas. They would rely too heavily on memorized facts, rather than developing their own thoughts and insights.",
    "**Memory Saturation**: The constant influx of new information would lead to memory saturation, making it difficult for humans to retain new information. This would result in a decrease in cognitive abilities, as the brain would become accustomed to relying on memorized facts rather than learning and processing new information.",
    "**Social and Emotional Impacts**: Humans would struggle to form meaningful relationships, as they would be constantly recalling past conversations and interactions. This would lead to social anxiety, as individuals would feel like they're living in a never-ending loop of memories.",
    "**Evolutionary Consequences**: If humans could recall every piece of information they've ever read, it could lead to an evolutionary dead-end. The ability to recall information would become the primary factor in determining intelligence, rather than creativity, problem-solving, or adaptability. This would hinder human evolution, as the species would become too reliant on memorization rather than innovation."
