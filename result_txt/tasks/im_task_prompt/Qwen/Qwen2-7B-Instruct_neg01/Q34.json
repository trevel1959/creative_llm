    "**Interactive Mirror Room**: Design a public space or art installation where mirrors are placed in a way that creates optical illusions, disorienting visitors and encouraging them to explore their reflections from various angles. The room could be designed to change perception, making people appear taller, shorter, wider, or narrower than they actually are.",
    "**Mirror Maze for Team Building**: Create a large-scale maze made entirely of mirrors for corporate team-building exercises. Participants would need to work together, using strategic thinking and communication, to navigate through the maze and reach the end. This could enhance trust, collaboration, and problem-solving skills among team members.",
    "**Customizable Mirror Clothing**: Develop wearable tech that incorporates mirrors into clothing items like shirts, jackets, or even shoes. The user can control the reflective properties of the material, changing it from fully reflective to opaque, creating dynamic looks that adapt based on the environment or personal preference.",
    "**Mirrored Escape Room**: Combine traditional escape rooms with a mirrored theme. The puzzles within the room would involve reflection, shadows, and the manipulation of light to solve. For example, participants might need to use mirrors to see around corners or reflect light onto switches or hidden objects.",
    "**Virtual Reality Mirror Experience**: Create a VR application that allows users to virtually interact with themselves in real-time through a mirror interface. Users could practice various activities such as yoga, dance, or martial arts, receive feedback on their movements, and even compare themselves to professional demonstrations or tutorials. The immersive experience would make learning more engaging and effective."
