    "**Water-Powered Jetpacks**: Innovate a jetpack that uses water propulsion technology. This device would work by taking in water from the ocean, heating it to create steam, and then expelling it to generate thrust. With adjustable nozzles, travelers could control their height and direction, allowing for agile navigation over large bodies of water. This method would be perfect for individuals who want to travel quickly and enjoy the thrill of flying above the waves, while also being eco-friendly.",
    "**Bamboo Catamarans**: Construct catamarans using sustainable bamboo, known for its strength and flexibility. These eco-friendly vessels could be designed for small groups, with ample space for supplies and sleeping quarters. Travelers could paddle or use a sail for propulsion, making the journey an adventurous workout. The catamarans would be easy to assemble and disassemble, allowing for portability and the ability to explore remote islands or coastlines along the way.",
    "**Submersible Gliders**: Develop personal submersible gliders that allow travelers to glide just below the water's surface. These gliders would be streamlined for minimal resistance and could be powered by a combination of human paddling and a small, rechargeable battery. Equipped with transparent viewing domes, travelers would experience the underwater world as they glide across the surface, making for an exciting and immersive travel experience while also allowing for exploration of marine life.",
    "**Kite-Powered Ferries**: Create a fleet of large, kite-powered ferries that utilize wind energy for transportation. These ferries would have large kites attached to a system of pulleys, allowing them to harness wind power to move across the water. Passengers could enjoy the scenic views while being propelled by the natural forces of the wind, making it an environmentally friendly and innovative way to travel long distances over water.",
    "**Water-Current Surfboards**: Design advanced surfboards that utilize water currents for travel. These boards would have built-in fins and hydrofoils that allow them to glide smoothly over the water while being powered by the natural currents. Equipped with GPS and an automated steering system, travelers could ride the currents to their desired location. This would be an exhilarating way to traverse large bodies of water while enjoying the thrill of surfing."
