    "3D Printing: In the absence of paper, one could use 3D printing technology to create physical copies of important documents. This would require the use of a 3D printer and a digital copy of the document. The 3D printer would create a physical copy of the document that could be easily read and stored.",
    "Digital Storage: Another option would be to store important information digitally on a computer or other electronic device. This could include using cloud storage services or external hard drives to store documents, photos, and other important data.",
    "Optical Storage: Optical storage devices such as CDs, DVDs, and Blu-rays could also be used to store important information. These devices are small, portable, and can store a large amount of data.",
    "Holographic Storage: Holographic storage is a new technology that allows for the storage of large amounts of data in a small space. This technology uses holographic principles to store data in a three-dimensional space, allowing for the storage of more data in less space.",
    "Augmented Reality: Augmented reality technology could be used to display important information in a virtual environment. This could include using smart glasses or other augmented reality devices to display documents, photos, and other important data."
