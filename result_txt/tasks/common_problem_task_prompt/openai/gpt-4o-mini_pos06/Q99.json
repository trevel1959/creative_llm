    "**Wearable Haptic Feedback Device**: Create a wristband or belt that uses haptic feedback to guide visually impaired users. This device would have sensors that detect obstacles and provide vibrations in different patterns to indicate the distance and direction of nearby objects. For example, a gentle vibration could indicate a nearby person, while a stronger pulse might signify a wall or other obstruction. This intuitive feedback system would allow users to maintain spatial awareness and navigate more safely.",
    "**Voice-Activated Smart Canes**: Design a smart cane that not only provides traditional tactile feedback but also features voice activation and smart technology. Users could ask the cane for information about their surroundings, such as the distance to the nearest bus stop or the location of a specific building. The cane could also have an emergency feature that connects to a designated contact or emergency services if the user feels threatened or lost.",
    "**Sensory Mapping App**: Develop an app that allows visually impaired users to create and share sensory maps of their environment. Using crowd-sourced data, users can input information about tactile landmarks, sounds, and scents that help orient them in specific locations. The app could also include audio descriptions of public spaces, making it easier for users to familiarize themselves with new areas before visiting.",
    "**Interactive Smart Home System**: Create a smart home system specifically designed for visually impaired individuals. This system would use voice commands to control lights, appliances, and security systems. It could also provide audio feedback about the home environment, such as alerts for open doors or windows, reminders for medication, or notifications for package deliveries. This would enhance the independence and safety of visually impaired users in their own homes.",
    "**Personalized AI Companion**: Develop an AI-powered personal assistant that caters to the needs of visually impaired users. This assistant could learn about the userâ€™s preferences and routines, providing tailored recommendations for activities, navigation, and even social interactions. For instance, it could suggest nearby events, help schedule transportation, or facilitate conversations by reading texts aloud or providing context for social situations."
