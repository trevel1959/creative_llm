    "**Atmospheric Water Harvesters**: Develop advanced atmospheric water generators that extract moisture from the air. These devices would use a combination of cooling coils and desiccants to condense water vapor from the atmosphere, even in arid regions. By incorporating renewable energy sources, such as wind or solar power, these harvesters could provide a sustainable and eco-friendly solution for obtaining clean water.",
    "**Bioremediation Gardens**: Create bioremediation gardens using specific plants known for their ability to absorb and filter pollutants from water. These gardens would consist of a diverse range of plants, such as cattails and willows, that can thrive in polluted water. As the water flows through the root systems, contaminants would be absorbed, and the water would be purified naturally. The clean water could then be collected for drinking.",
    "**Portable Water Filtration Units**: Design compact, portable filtration units that can be easily transported to areas in need. These units would use a multi-stage filtration process, incorporating activated carbon, ceramic filters, and UV light purification. Users could fill the unit with contaminated water, and within minutes, they would have access to safe drinking water. This technology would be particularly useful in emergency situations or remote locations.",
    "**Community Rainwater Harvesting Systems**: Implement large-scale community rainwater harvesting systems that collect and store rainwater for drinking. These systems would include filtration and purification stages to ensure the water is safe for consumption. By using natural rainfall, communities could create a sustainable source of clean water, reducing reliance on polluted sources and enhancing resilience to climate change.",
    "**Desalination with Renewable Energy**: Innovate small-scale desalination plants powered by renewable energy sources like solar or wind. These plants would use reverse osmosis or distillation methods to convert seawater into fresh drinking water. By harnessing renewable energy, the process would be environmentally friendly and could provide clean water to coastal communities facing freshwater shortages."
