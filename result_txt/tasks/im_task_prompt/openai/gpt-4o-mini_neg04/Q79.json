    "**Multi-Functional Hanger**: Design a clothes hanger that includes additional features such as a built-in folding mechanism for easy storage, clips for holding pants or skirts, and hooks for accessories like scarves or belts. This would eliminate the need for multiple types of hangers and streamline the organization of a closet.",
    "**Scent Infusion Hanger**: Create a hanger that can hold scent-infused pads or essential oil cartridges. This would help keep clothes smelling fresh while they hang in the closet. The pads could be easily replaceable, and users could choose different scents based on their preferences or the season.",
    "**Adjustable Size Hanger**: Develop a hanger that can adjust its width to accommodate various sizes of clothing. This would be particularly useful for oversized garments or delicate fabrics that need extra support. The adjustable feature could also prevent clothes from slipping off, ensuring they stay in place.",
    "**Hanger with Integrated Lighting**: Introduce a hanger that features built-in LED lights to illuminate clothing when in a dark closet or wardrobe. This would help users easily find and select outfits without having to turn on a bright overhead light, creating a more pleasant experience during early mornings or late nights.",
    "**Eco-Friendly Hanger**: Create a hanger made from sustainable materials, such as bamboo or recycled plastics, that is biodegradable. Additionally, the hanger could have a design that allows it to be disassembled for recycling or repurposing. This would appeal to environmentally conscious consumers looking to reduce their carbon footprint."
