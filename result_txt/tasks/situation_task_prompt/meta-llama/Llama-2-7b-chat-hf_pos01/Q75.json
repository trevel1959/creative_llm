    "Solar Powered Vehicles: One creative solution to power vehicles if all the world's oil suddenly disappeared would be to transition to solar-powered vehicles. These vehicles would be equipped with large solar panels on their roofs or hoods, which would absorb sunlight and convert it into electricity to power the vehicle's electric motor. The electricity could be stored in advanced batteries, allowing for a longer driving range. Confidence Score: 0.8",
    "Hydrogen Fuel Cell Vehicles: Another option for powering vehicles if oil were to disappear would be to switch to hydrogen fuel cell vehicles. These vehicles would use hydrogen as a fuel source, which would be converted into electricity through a fuel cell. The only byproduct of this process would be water vapor and heat, making it a much cleaner and more sustainable option than traditional fossil fuels. Confidence Score: 0.9",
    "Electric Bikes and Scooters: A more practical and cost-effective solution for powering vehicles in the short term would be to promote the use of electric bikes and scooters. These vehicles are already available in the market and can be powered by rechargeable batteries. With the widespread adoption of these vehicles, there would be less reliance on oil for transportation. Confidence Score: 0.7",
    "Bio-Ethanol Fuel: Another option for powering vehicles if oil were to disappear would be to use bio-ethanol fuel. This fuel is made from organic matter such as agricultural waste, which can be converted into a liquid fuel that can be used to power vehicles. This would reduce the reliance on fossil fuels and provide a sustainable alternative. Confidence Score: 0.8",
    "Magnetic Levitation Vehicles: A more futuristic and creative solution for powering vehicles if oil were to disappear would be to use magnetic levitation vehicles. These vehicles would use magnetic fields to lift and propel them, eliminating the need for any fuel source. This technology is still in its infancy, but it has the potential to revolutionize transportation in the future. Confidence Score: 0.6"
