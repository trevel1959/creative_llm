    "Once in the sunlit outback, there lived a kangaroo named Kiki who couldn’t hop. While her friends bounded joyfully, Kiki felt left out. Determined to join in, she devised clever ways to keep up—she rolled, she crawled, and even created a makeshift cart from a discarded crate. One day, during a race, Kiki’s ingenuity shone as she zipped past her friends on her cart, cheering them on. Inspired, the other kangaroos realized that hopping wasn’t the only way to have fun. From that day on, Kiki led her friends in games that celebrated everyone’s unique talents, proving that true joy comes from creativity.",
