    "SpongeBob SquarePants-inspired Theme Park: Create a theme park based on the popular Nickelodeon character SpongeBob SquarePants. The park could feature rides, attractions, and shows inspired by the show, such as the Krusty Krab restaurant, Bikini Bottom, and the Fry Cook Boat. Visitors could also interact with SpongeBob and his friends, including Patrick Star, Sandy Cheeks, and Mr. Krabs.",
    "Sponge-Based Water Filtration System: Develop a water filtration system that utilizes sponges as the primary filtering material. The system could be designed for use in homes, communities, or even disaster zones, providing clean drinking water to those in need. The sponges could be made from sustainable materials, such as coconut shells or recycled plastic, and could be easily replaced when saturated.",
    "Sponge-Inspired Building Material: Create a new building material inspired by the structure and properties of sponges. The material could be made from a combination of natural and synthetic materials, such as wood fibers, plastic, and foam. The sponge-like material could provide excellent insulation, soundproofing, and water resistance, making it ideal for use in construction and architecture.",
    "Sponge-Based Dental Implants: Develop dental implants that mimic the structure and properties of sponges. The implants could be made from a combination of biocompatible materials, such as titanium and ceramic, and could be designed to mimic the sponge-like structure of the jawbone. This could provide a more natural and durable alternative to traditional dental implants, promoting better bone growth and integration.",
    "Sponge-Inspired Underwater Communication Device: Design an underwater communication device inspired by the structure and properties of sponges. The device could use the sponge-like material to absorb and transmit sound waves, allowing for clear and reliable communication between divers and underwater vehicles. The device could also be used for scientific research, such as studying marine life and tracking ocean currents."
