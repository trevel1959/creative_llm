    "Synthetic Vitamin Production: If all fruits and vegetables were to disappear, synthetic vitamin production could be a viable solution. Synthetic vitamins are produced in laboratories using chemical reactions and can be used as a substitute for natural vitamins. This method is widely used by pharmaceutical companies to produce vitamins that are not found naturally in foods.",
    "Insect-Based Supplements: Many insects contain high levels of vitamins and minerals, making them an excellent source of nutrients. For example, crickets are rich in protein and vitamin B6, while mealworms are a good source of iron and zinc. Insects could be raised and processed into supplements that could be consumed by humans.",
    "Genetic Engineering: Genetic engineering could be used to create plants that are rich in specific vitamins and minerals. By manipulating the genes of crops, scientists could develop plants that produce higher levels of vitamins like vitamin C or iron. These genetically modified crops could then be grown and harvested as a source of essential nutrients.",
    "Aquatic Vegetables: If freshwater is readily available, aquatic vegetables like watercress and algae could be cultivated and consumed as a source of essential vitamins and minerals. These aquatic plants grow quickly and can be harvested regularly, providing a reliable source of nutrition.",
    "Cultured Microorganisms: Some microorganisms like bacteria and yeast are capable of producing certain vitamins like vitamin K and biotin. These microorganisms could be grown in large quantities and used to produce supplements that could be consumed by humans. Additionally, some bacteria and fungi have been shown to be able to convert waste products into usable nutrients, making them another potential source of essential vitamins and minerals."
