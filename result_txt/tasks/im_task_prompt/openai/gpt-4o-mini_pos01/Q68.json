    "**Voice-Activated Calculations**:    - Introduce a voice recognition feature that allows users to input calculations verbally. This hands-free option would be beneficial in scenarios where typing is impractical, such as while cooking or during a presentation. The calculator could also read back results and provide explanations for complex mathematical concepts, catering to auditory learners.",
    "**Customizable User Interface**:    - Create a calculator that allows users to personalize the interface according to their preferences. Users could choose different themes, layouts, and functionalities, making the tool more user-friendly and visually appealing. This could include options for color-blind modes or different font sizes for better accessibility.",
    "**Integration with Educational Platforms**:    - Develop a calculator that seamlessly integrates with educational platforms, allowing students to solve problems directly from their homework or study materials. It could provide hints, step-by-step solutions, and even connect to tutors for real-time assistance. This feature would foster a more interactive and supportive learning environment.",
    "**Gamification of Math Problems**:    - Turn the calculator into a game-based learning tool where users earn points or rewards for solving problems. Users could participate in challenges, compete with friends, or unlock new levels of difficulty as they improve their skills. This approach would make learning math more engaging and motivate students to practice regularly.",
    "**Multi-Functionality with Built-in Apps**:    - Expand the calculator's functionality by integrating various applications, such as a graphing tool, unit converter, and financial calculator. Users could switch between modes depending on their needs, reducing the number of devices they need to carry. This all-in-one solution would be particularly appealing to students and professionals who require different tools for various tasks."
