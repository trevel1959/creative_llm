    "Use pollen from other sources: If all the flowers disappeared, one could still pollinate plants by collecting pollen from other sources such as cones, nuts, and seeds. This could be done manually or with the help of a machine. The pollen could then be applied to the stigma of the plant to fertilize it.",
    "Use wind or water to pollinate: In the absence of flowers, wind or water could be used to pollinate plants. For example, wind could be used to carry pollen from one plant to another, while water could be used to transport pollen from one location to another.",
    "Use pollen from insects: Insects such as bees, butterflies, and moths play a vital role in pollinating plants. If all the flowers disappeared, one could still pollinate plants by collecting pollen from the bodies of these insects.",
