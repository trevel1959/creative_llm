    "Unpredictable Tides: Having two moons would cause tides to become unpredictable and more frequent, leading to coastal flooding and erosion. The gravitational pull of each moon would create different tidal patterns, making it challenging for marine life and coastal communities to adapt.",
    "Gravity Imbalance: With two moons, the gravitational forces on Earth would become uneven, affecting the planet's rotation, axis tilt, and overall stability. This could lead to catastrophic consequences such as earthquakes, volcanic eruptions, and changes in weather patterns.",
    "Increased Cosmic Impacts: A second moon would provide a larger surface area for asteroids and comets to collide with, increasing the likelihood of impacts and potentially causing mass extinctions. The additional gravitational pull of the second moon could also disrupt the orbits of these celestial bodies, making them more likely to collide with Earth.",
    "Stellar Interactions: The presence of a second moon would significantly impact the interactions between Earth and other celestial bodies in the solar system. For example, the gravitational pull of the second moon could disrupt the orbits of nearby planets, leading to chaotic and unpredictable changes in the solar system's dynamics.",
    "Unusual Lunar Phenomena: With two moons, the Earth would experience unusual lunar phenomena such as double eclipses, dual lunar phases, and increased meteor showers. These changes would provide scientists with a unique opportunity to study the moon's behavior and gain insights into the early formation of our solar system."
