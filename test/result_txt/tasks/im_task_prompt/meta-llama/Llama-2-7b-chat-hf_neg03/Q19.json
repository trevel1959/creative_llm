    "Smart Glasses for the Visually Impaired: Develop a pair of glasses with advanced sensors and AI-powered software that can enhance the visual experience for people with visual impairments. The glasses could detect objects, faces, and colors, and provide real-time audio or haptic feedback to help the wearer navigate their surroundings more confidently.",
    "Augmented Reality Glasses for Artists: Create a pair of glasses that can display a virtual canvas and art tools for artists. The glasses could use AR technology to project a virtual canvas onto any surface, allowing artists to sketch, paint, or draw in 3D space. The glasses could also include tools like a virtual eraser, brushes, and colors, making it easier for artists to create and collaborate on art projects.",
    "Glasses with Built-in VR Headphones: Develop a pair of glasses with built-in VR headphones that can provide an immersive audio experience. The headphones could use bone conduction technology to transmit sound directly to the wearer's inner ear, providing a more immersive and comfortable listening experience. The glasses could also include advanced noise-cancellation technology to block out external noise and improve the overall audio experience.",
    "Glasses with a Built-in Brain-Computer Interface: Create a pair of glasses with a built-in brain-computer interface (BCI) that can read brain signals and translate them into digital commands. The glasses could use EEG sensors to detect brain activity and translate it into commands for controlling digital devices, such as smartphones or computers. This could be useful for people with mobility or cognitive impairments, as well as for gaming or other applications where precise control is required.",
    "Glasses with a Built-in Microprojector: Develop a pair of glasses with a built-in microprojector that can project images or videos onto any surface. The microprojector could use LED or laser technology to produce high-resolution images with vibrant colors and detailed contrast. The glasses could also include advanced beamforming technology to focus the projected image onto a specific area, making it easier to share content with others or to display information in a more immersive way."
