    "**Overwhelming Information Overload**: With the ability to remember everything they read, humans would be bombarded with an immense amount of information, making it difficult to filter out irrelevant details and prioritize what's truly important. This could lead to mental fatigue, decreased productivity, and a general sense of overwhelm. (Confidence score: 0.9)",
    "**Loss of Critical Thinking Skills**: If humans could remember everything they read, they might rely too heavily on rote memorization rather than developing critical thinking skills. This could result in a lack of nuance and depth in their understanding of complex topics, leading to poor decision-making and a diminished capacity for independent thought. (Confidence score: 0.8)",
    "**Erosion of Personal Boundaries**: With the ability to recall every detail of every book, article, or social media post, individuals might feel compelled to share their vast knowledge with others, potentially invading their personal space and boundaries. This could lead to social awkwardness, decreased empathy, and a lack of self-awareness. (Confidence score: 0.7)",
    "**Unprecedented Access to Sensitive Information**: Remembering everything they read would grant humans access to sensitive information, such as confidential business data, personal secrets, or classified government documents. This could lead to a massive breach of trust, compromised national security, and potentially catastrophic consequences. (Confidence score: 0.9)",
    "**Evolution of Storytelling and Creative Expression**: On the other hand, the ability to remember everything they read could revolutionize the way we experience and interact with stories. Humans might develop new forms of creative expression, such as immersive, interactive narratives that draw upon their vast collective knowledge. This could lead to a renaissance in literature, art, and entertainment. (Confidence score: 0.6)"
