    "Information Overload: The sheer volume of information would be overwhelming and could potentially cause anxiety or stress. People might become overwhelmed by the pressure to remember everything and could experience memory overload.",
    "Difficulty in Finding Answers: With an endless amount of information stored in people's minds, it would be challenging to locate specific pieces of information when needed. Finding answers to specific questions would become time-consuming and inefficient.",
    "Loss of Short-Term Memory: Without the forgetting mechanism, we rely on short-term memory to store information temporarily. If humans could remember everything they read, short-term memory would gradually decline, leading to a loss of the ability to remember new information quickly.",
    "Decreased Creativity: Constant remembrance of information might stifle creativity, as it could be difficult to develop new ideas or perspectives when all information was permanently stored.",
    "Difficulty in Forgetting: The inability to forget would hinder the ability to learn from our mistakes and experiences. This continuous memory retention could slow down personal growth and make it challenging to move on from past mistakes or events."
