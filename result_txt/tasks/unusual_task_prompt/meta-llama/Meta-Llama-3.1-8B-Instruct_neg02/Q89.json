    "**Smart Coffee Grinder with Integrated Recipe Book**: Design a coffee grinder with a built-in digital display and a library of recipes that can be accessed through a companion app. Users can upload their own recipes or browse through a curated selection, with the grinder automatically adjusting grind settings and brewing parameters to achieve the perfect cup. The app could also include features like flavor profiling, brewing guides, and a community forum for users to share their favorite recipes.",
    "**Coffee Grinder with Built-in Coffee Roaster**: Create a multi-functional device that not only grinds coffee beans but also roasts them to the perfect level. This would involve integrating a small roasting chamber into the grinder, allowing users to roast their beans in-house and grind them immediately after. The device could include a temperature control system and a built-in thermometer to ensure precise roasting.",
    "**Coffee Grinder with Automated Cleaning System**: Design a coffee grinder with an integrated cleaning system that uses a combination of water and air jets to remove coffee oils and residue from the grinding mechanism. This would involve a small water reservoir and a series of tiny nozzles that spray water and air through the grinder's interior, keeping it clean and free of old coffee residue.",
    "**Coffee Grinder with Integrated Scale and Brewing Timer**: Create a coffee grinder with a built-in scale and brewing timer, allowing users to accurately measure their coffee and water ratios. The scale could be a high-precision digital scale, and the brewing timer could be a countdown timer that alerts the user when it's time to start brewing.",
    "**Coffee Grinder with Augmented Reality Integration**: Design a coffee grinder with an augmented reality (AR) interface that allows users to see virtual coffee beans, grind settings, and brewing parameters projected onto their kitchen countertop. This could involve a small camera and display system that uses AR software to superimpose virtual information onto the physical world. Users could use the AR interface to explore different grind settings, brewing methods, and coffee recipes in a more immersive and engaging way."
