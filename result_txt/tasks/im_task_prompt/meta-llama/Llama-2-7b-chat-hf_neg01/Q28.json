This would be particularly useful in hot and humid climates, where bicycle riders often struggle with overheating.",
    "Smart Bicycle Helmet: A helmet that integrates advanced safety features such as a built-in camera, GPS, and Bluetooth connectivity. The camera captures footage of the road ahead and can be used to detect potential hazards, such as potholes or debris, and alert the rider. The GPS function can track the rider's route and provide turn-by-turn directions, while the Bluetooth connectivity allows the rider to receive notifications and messages from their phone.",
    "Bicycle Helmet with Built-in Speaker System: A helmet that incorporates a high-quality speaker system, allowing riders to listen to music or take hands-free calls while they ride. The speakers are positioned in such a way as to provide optimal sound quality and minimize wind noise. This would be a great feature for long rides or commutes, as it would allow riders to stay entertained and focused on the road.",
    "Bicycle Helmet with Solar Charging: A helmet that incorporates solar panels on the visor or side of the helmet, allowing riders to charge their devices on the go. This would be particularly useful for long rides or in areas with limited access to power outlets. The solar panels could be designed to provide a charge through a USB port, allowing riders to keep their devices powered up and ready to use.",
    "Bicycle Helmet with Integrated Lighting: A helmet that features built-in LED lights on the front, rear, or both, providing visibility to other road users, especially in low-light conditions. The lights could be adjustable, allowing riders to customize the amount of light they want to emit. This would be a great safety feature for nighttime rides or in areas with limited lighting."
