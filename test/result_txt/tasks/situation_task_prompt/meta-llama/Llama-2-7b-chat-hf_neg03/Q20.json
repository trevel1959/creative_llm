    "Floating Islands: Create a network of interconnected floating islands that can be used as a mode of transportation. These islands could be made of a lightweight, buoyant material and could be propelled by wind, solar, or hydrogen fuel cells. Passengers could travel from one continent to another by hopping from island to island, with each island providing a comfortable and sustainable mode of transportation.",
    "Submersible Tunnels: Develop a system of submersible tunnels that run beneath the oceans, connecting different continents. These tunnels could be made of a flexible, durable material that can withstand the immense pressure of the water at such great depths. Passengers could travel through the tunnels in specially designed submersibles, enjoying a safe and efficient journey.",
    "Space Travel: In the absence of planes, space travel could become the primary mode of intercontinental transportation. With the development of reusable rockets and spacecraft, it may become possible to travel between continents in a matter of hours rather than days or weeks. Passengers could experience zero-gravity travel, observe the curvature of the Earth, and enjoy the breathtaking views of the cosmos.",
    "Hovercraft: Create a new generation of hovercraft that can travel over land and water. These hovercraft could be powered by advanced magnetic levitation technology, which would allow them to float above the surface of the Earth without any friction or resistance. Passengers could travel at high speeds, enjoying a smooth and comfortable journey with minimal environmental impact.",
    "Quantum Teleportation: Develop a technology that allows for the teleportation of people and objects from one location to another. This technology could be based on the principles of quantum entanglement, where particles are connected in such a way that their properties are identical, regardless of the distance between them. Passengers could be \"quantum teleported\" from one continent to another, allowing for faster than light travel and eliminating the need for any physical mode of transportation."
