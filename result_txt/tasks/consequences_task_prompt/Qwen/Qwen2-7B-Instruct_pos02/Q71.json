    "**Cultural Revolution:** The discovery of immortality would likely trigger a major shift in human culture, religion, philosophy, and ethics. People would reevaluate their life goals, mortality's role in societal structures, and the concept of time. It could lead to new spiritual practices, art forms that explore eternal life, and philosophical debates on what it means to be alive and what makes life valuable.",
    "**Technological Advancements:** The quest for immortality would accelerate technological development in biotechnology, nanotechnology, artificial intelligence, and genetics. Researchers would work tirelessly to find ways to maintain health, prevent aging, and eventually achieve immortality through advanced medical interventions or AI-driven enhancements. This could lead to breakthroughs in healthcare, prolonging not just human lifespan but also improving overall quality of life.",
    "**Economic Shifts:** The discovery of immortality would fundamentally alter economic systems as labor markets, retirement planning, and insurance industries would need to adapt. There could be a shift towards more sustainable economies since people would not retire, potentially leading to overpopulation and resource scarcity. On the other hand, there might be a surge in demand for luxury goods and services tailored for the immortal population, creating new market opportunities.",
    "**Psychological Impact:** Living forever could have profound psychological implications. Individuals might struggle with feelings of boredom, existential dread, or a lack of purpose once the excitement of novelty fades. Societal norms around relationships, family dynamics, and personal growth could change as people experience long-term emotional and psychological challenges. Mental health services would need to evolve to address these unique issues.",
    "**Sociopolitical Changes:** With the potential for unlimited lifespans, social inequalities could become more pronounced as access to longevity technologies becomes a privilege of the wealthy, exacerbating existing wealth gaps. This could lead to social unrest and political shifts as governments and international bodies struggle to create equitable policies around immortality. Questions about who gets to live forever and how resources should be distributed could become central political debates."
