    "Solar-Powered Lanterns: Create portable, rechargeable lanterns that harness the energy of the sun to provide light during the day. These lanterns could be powered by small solar panels, allowing them to be used both indoors and outdoors.",
    "Smart Windows: Develop special windows that can change their tint and opacity to adjust to the amount of light available. These windows could darken in low light conditions, providing additional light during the day.",
    "Light-Emitting Plants: Genetically engineer plants to produce light in addition to their normal photosynthesis process. These light-emitting plants could be placed around the home or office to provide additional light during the day.",
    "Mirror-Based Lighting: Develop mirrors with built-in LED lights that can be angled to provide focused light where it is needed. These mirrors could be hung on walls or placed on tables to provide additional light during the day.",
    "Cloud-Based Lighting: Create a network of drones or balloons that can be deployed to reflect sunlight towards a specific area during periods of low light. These cloud-based lighting systems could provide additional light during the day without the need for traditional light sources."
