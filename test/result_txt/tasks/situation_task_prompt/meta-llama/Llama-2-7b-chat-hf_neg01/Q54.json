    "Hydrofoil Sleds: Develop a lightweight, hydrofoil-equipped sled that can be pulled across the water by a single person or a team of people. The hydrofoils would lift the sled out of the water, reducing drag and allowing for faster travel. The sled could be steered using a combination of the puller's strength and a small rudder.",
    "Water Bikes: Create a bike that can be pedaled underwater, allowing riders to travel across large bodies of water. The bike would need to be designed with a waterproof coating and specialized pedals that can be operated underwater. The pedals would be connected to a propeller that would push the bike through the water, allowing for efficient and sustainable travel.",
    "Aqua Gliders: Design a glider that can be used to travel across the water without any engine or propulsion system. The glider would use the wind and currents to stay aloft, allowing riders to glide across the water with minimal effort. The glider could be steered using a small rudder or by shifting the rider's weight.",
    "Water Trikes: Create a three-wheeled vehicle that can be powered by a combination of human power and a small electric motor. The vehicle would be designed to be stable and easy to maneuver, allowing riders to travel across the water with ease. The electric motor would provide additional power to help the rider navigate through rough waters or against strong currents.",
    "Aqua Submarines: Develop a submersible vessel that can be used to travel underwater. The submarine would be designed to be comfortable and spacious, allowing riders to travel long distances without feeling cramped or uncomfortable. The submarine could be powered by a combination of batteries and a small electric motor, making it a sustainable and eco-friendly mode of transportation."
