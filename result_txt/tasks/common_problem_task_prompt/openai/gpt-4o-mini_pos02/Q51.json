    "**Budget Overruns**: Large-scale events often have many moving parts, which can lead to unexpected expenses. Problems may arise from underestimating costs for catering, audiovisual equipment, or entertainment. To mitigate this, create a detailed budget that includes a contingency fund for unforeseen expenses. Regularly review the budget throughout the planning process and seek competitive quotes from multiple vendors to ensure cost-effectiveness.",
    "**Logistics and Transportation**: Coordinating transportation for a large number of attendees can be a logistical nightmare. Issues may include traffic congestion, inadequate parking, or difficulty finding the venue. To solve this, consider arranging shuttle services from key locations, providing detailed maps and transportation options in advance, and scheduling the event during off-peak hours to minimize traffic. Additionally, communicate with attendees about their transportation plans to gauge needs.",
    "**Technology Failures**: Reliance on technology for presentations, live streaming, or attendee engagement can lead to problems if equipment fails or internet connectivity is poor. To avoid this, conduct thorough testing of all technology before the event, have backup equipment on hand, and ensure reliable internet access. Hiring a professional AV team can also help troubleshoot any issues that arise during the event.",
    "**Catering and Dietary Restrictions**: Catering for a large group can be complicated, especially when accommodating dietary restrictions or preferences. Problems may include food allergies, vegetarian/vegan options, or cultural dietary needs being overlooked. To address this, gather dietary information from attendees during the registration process and work closely with the catering team to ensure a diverse menu that caters to all needs. Offering a range of options at the event can also help avoid issues.",
    "**Engagement and Networking Opportunities**: A corporate event should foster engagement and networking among attendees. Potential problems may include poorly designed activities that fail to engage participants or a lack of opportunities for meaningful connections. To enhance engagement, incorporate interactive sessions, panel discussions, and icebreaker activities. Providing designated networking spaces and encouraging attendees to share their contact information can also facilitate connections."
