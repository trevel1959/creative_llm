    "Smart Key Fob with Built-in Fingerprint Sensor: Develop a key fob that includes a fingerprint sensor, allowing users to unlock their cars with just a simple touch of their fingerprint. This technology would provide an additional layer of security and convenience for car owners, as they wouldn't have to worry about losing their physical keys.",
    "Keyless Entry and Start System with AI-Powered Personalization: Create a keyless entry and start system that uses AI to recognize and personalize the user's preferences. For example, the system could automatically adjust the temperature, seat settings, and music preferences based on the user's past behavior. This would provide a more personalized and convenient driving experience.",
    "Invisible Keys: Develop a technology that allows users to unlock their cars using invisible light signals. This could involve using near-field communication (NFC) technology to transmit a unique code to the car's computer system, which would then unlock the doors. This technology would provide an additional layer of security and convenience, as users wouldn't have to physically handle their keys.",
    "Keyless Entry and Payment System with Contactless Payment: Create a keyless entry and payment system that allows users to unlock their cars and make payments using a single device. This could involve integrating a contactless payment system, such as Apple Pay or Google Wallet, with the car's computer system. This would provide a more convenient and streamlined payment experience for users.",
    "Smart Key Fob with Augmented Reality Display: Develop a key fob that includes an augmented reality (AR) display, allowing users to see important information about their car, such as navigation directions, traffic updates, and maintenance reminders. This technology would provide a more interactive and informative driving experience, and could potentially reduce the need for separate navigation and infotainment systems."
