    "**Eco-Friendly Water Recycling System**: Design a built-in water recycling mechanism that filters and purifies the rinse water for reuse in subsequent washes. This system would significantly reduce water consumption, making the washing machine more environmentally friendly. Users could have the option to choose how much recycled water to use based on their load size and fabric types.",
    "**Interactive App with Virtual Laundry Assistant**: Develop a companion app that acts as a virtual laundry assistant. Users can input their laundry needs, and the app will provide personalized washing recommendations, including optimal cycles, detergent choices, and even reminders for maintenance. The app could also include a feature for tracking laundry supplies and ordering more when running low.",
    "**Noise-Canceling Technology**: Incorporate noise-canceling technology into the washing machine design to minimize operational noise. This could be particularly beneficial for urban dwellers or those with open-concept living spaces. Using sound-dampening materials and innovative engineering, the washing machine could operate quietly, allowing users to run cycles at any time without disturbing their environment.",
    "**Customizable Wash Cycle Profiles**: Allow users to create and save custom wash cycle profiles based on their preferences or specific clothing items. For example, users could set a gentle cycle for delicate fabrics, a heavy-duty cycle for work clothes, or a quick wash for lightly soiled items. This feature would make the washing machine more versatile and user-friendly.",
    "**Integrated Stain Removal System**: Add a built-in stain removal feature that uses targeted jets of water and eco-friendly stain removal agents to treat specific stains before the wash cycle begins. Users could select the type of stain (e.g., grease, wine, ink) through a user interface, and the machine would apply the appropriate treatment before starting the wash, enhancing cleaning effectiveness."
