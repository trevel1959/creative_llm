    "Gun control laws would become more effective: Without guns, the need for gun control laws would decrease. However, if gun control laws were still in place, they would be more effective in preventing gun violence and ensuring that firearms are only used for lawful purposes.",
    "People would be more open to alternative forms of self-defense: If guns were no longer an option, people would need to find other ways to protect themselves and their families. This could lead to a rise in the use of non-violent forms of self-defense, such as martial arts or personal security systems."
