    "**Future-Proofing Your Present**: If you could time travel, you'd likely want to prevent or mitigate future disasters.

This could involve setting up early warning systems, distributing resources, or even influencing global policy to become more resilient.",

For example, introducing renewable energy sources to prevent climate change, bringing medical advancements to cure diseases, or even changing political outcomes to promote peace and prosperity.",
    "**Chrono-Crime Squad**: Establish a team of time travelers who investigate crimes that span across timelines. They would have access to information from both the past and the future, allowing them to solve complex cases that involve temporal inconsistencies.
