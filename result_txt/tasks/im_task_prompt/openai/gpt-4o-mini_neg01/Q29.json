    "**Self-Cleaning Mechanism**: Design a self-cleaning feature that uses a combination of water jets and brushes to remove grass clippings and debris from the mower's blades and undercarriage after each use. This would not only improve the mower's efficiency but also reduce the maintenance time required for users, ensuring that the blades remain sharp and effective for longer periods.",
    "**Eco-Friendly Electric Mower with Solar Panels**: Develop an electric lawn mower that incorporates solar panels on its surface. These panels could charge the mower's battery during the day, allowing it to run on renewable energy. This would appeal to environmentally conscious consumers and reduce dependence on traditional power sources, making lawn care more sustainable.",
    "**Mower with Augmented Reality (AR) Assistance**: Create a mower that includes an AR headset or goggles that provide users with real-time information about their lawn while mowing. This could include data on grass health, areas that need more attention, and even suggestions for landscaping improvements. The AR system could also offer step-by-step guidance for maintenance tasks, such as blade sharpening or oil changes.",
    "**Multi-Function Mower with Attachments**: Design a versatile lawn mower that can easily switch between various attachments for different tasks. For instance, users could attach a leaf blower, hedge trimmer, or even a small tiller to the mower. This would make it a multifunctional tool for garden care, allowing homeowners to tackle multiple tasks without needing to invest in separate equipment.",
    "**Noise-Cancellation Technology**: Incorporate noise-cancellation technology into the mower to significantly reduce the sound produced during operation. This could involve advanced materials that absorb sound or an innovative design that minimizes vibration and noise output. A quieter mower would be particularly appealing for residential areas where noise ordinances are in place or for those who prefer a peaceful mowing experience."
