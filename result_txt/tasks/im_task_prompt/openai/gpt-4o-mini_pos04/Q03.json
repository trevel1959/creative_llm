    "**Multi-Function Steam and Grill Combo**:    Introduce a microwave that incorporates both steam and grill functions. The steam feature can be used for healthy cooking methods, such as steaming vegetables, while the grill function can create crispy finishes on meats and casseroles. A dual-chamber design would allow users to steam and grill simultaneously, maximizing flavor and texture without sacrificing cooking time.",
    "**Interactive Recipe Display**:    A built-in touchscreen display could offer an interactive recipe guide. Users can browse through a library of recipes, and the microwave will automatically adjust the cooking time and settings based on the selected recipe. The display could also show step-by-step instructions, making cooking more engaging and accessible, especially for novice cooks.",
    "**Self-Cleaning Technology**:    Incorporate a self-cleaning feature using steam and UV light. After cooking, the microwave can run a short cycle that generates steam to loosen food particles, followed by a UV light treatment that disinfects and eliminates odors. This would save users time and effort in cleaning, making the microwave more hygienic and user-friendly.",
    "**Eco-Friendly Energy Saver**:    Design a microwave that features an energy-saving mode, which uses sensors to detect when food is done cooking and automatically turns off the microwave, reducing energy consumption. Additionally, the microwave could be constructed with recyclable materials and include a solar panel option for off-grid use, appealing to environmentally conscious consumers.",
    "**Mood Lighting and Sound Effects**:    Enhance the user experience with customizable mood lighting and sound effects. Users could select different color themes and sounds that correspond to the cooking process, such as calming blue lights for steaming or warm amber for baking. This feature would create a more immersive cooking environment, making it enjoyable and less mundane."
