    "Use natural ingredients: If cosmetic products disappeared, we would have to rely on natural ingredients to maintain our personal grooming habits. This could include using fruits, vegetables, and other natural products to cleanse and moisturize our skin. For example, we could use lemon juice to brighten our teeth and apple cider vinegar to cleanse our hair.",
    "DIY grooming: We could also learn how to make our own cosmetic products. This could include making our own facial masks, lip balms, and body scrubs. This would not only help us save money, but it would also allow us to customize our grooming products to our specific needs.",
    "Outdoor activities: If cosmetic products disappeared, we would have to find other ways to maintain our personal grooming habits. This could include spending more time outdoors and engaging in activities like hiking, swimming, and camping. These activities would not only help us stay active and healthy, but they would also help us maintain our appearance.",
    "Social media challenges: We could also participate in social media challenges that encourage us to maintain our personal grooming habits without the use of cosmetic products. For example, we could participate in a \"no makeup\" challenge or a \"natural beauty\" challenge. This would not only help us stay motivated, but it would also help us learn new ways to maintain our appearance.",
    "Healthy diet: Finally, we could maintain our personal grooming habits by eating a healthy diet. This would include consuming plenty of fruits, vegetables, and other nutrients that are good for our skin, hair, and nails. For example, we could eat foods that are high in antioxidants, such as berries and dark chocolate, to help keep our skin healthy and youthful."
