    "**Memory Restoration App**: Create a virtual reality (VR) application designed to help patients with Alzheimer’s regain lost memories. By immersing patients in carefully crafted environments that trigger specific memories (like their childhood home or favorite vacation spot), this app could help reinforce neural pathways and stimulate cognitive functions, making therapy engaging and effective.",
    "**Community-Based Care Network**: Establish a global network of community support systems where trained volunteers and healthcare professionals provide in-home care and companionship to Alzheimer’s patients. This network would utilize technology to connect caregivers and families, ensuring that patients receive emotional and cognitive support tailored to their needs, ultimately improving their quality of life.",
    "**Nutritional Neurotherapy**: Research and develop a specialized diet rich in neuroprotective foods (like blueberries, fatty fish, and nuts) combined with personalized supplements that target brain health. This nutritional approach could be integrated into a comprehensive lifestyle program, promoting brain health and potentially delaying the onset of Alzheimer’s symptoms.",
    "**Cognitive Enhancement Devices**: Innovate wearable devices that utilize brainwave entrainment technology to enhance cognitive functions in Alzheimer's patients. These devices could use sound and light patterns to stimulate brain activity, helping to improve memory recall and cognitive performance while also providing real-time feedback to caregivers about the patient’s cognitive state.",
    "**Public Awareness Campaign**: Launch a global awareness campaign focused on Alzheimer’s education, aimed at reducing stigma and increasing understanding of the disease. This campaign would include storytelling initiatives featuring patients and families, encouraging early diagnosis and research funding while promoting community involvement in care and support."
