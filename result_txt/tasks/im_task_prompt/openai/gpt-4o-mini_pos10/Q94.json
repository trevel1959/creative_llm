    "**Mood-Responsive Candles**:    Develop candles embedded with mood-sensing technology that changes color based on the ambient mood of the room. Using a combination of LED lights and sensors, the candle can detect the emotional atmosphere (calm, energetic, romantic) and adjust its glow and scent accordingly. For example, if the mood is calm, the candle could emit a soft blue light and a soothing lavender scent, while an energetic atmosphere might trigger a bright yellow light and a citrus scent.",
    "**Eco-Friendly Seed Candles**:    Design candles made from biodegradable materials that contain seeds embedded within the wax. Once the candle has burned down completely, the leftover wax can be planted in soil, allowing the seeds to germinate and grow into flowers or herbs. This not only reduces waste but also promotes sustainability and adds an interactive element to candle use.",
    "**Candle with Integrated Timer**:    Create a candle with a built-in timer that allows users to set a specific burn duration. This feature would be especially useful for those who want to enjoy the ambiance of a candle without the worry of leaving it unattended for too long. The timer could be activated by a simple twist of the candle base, and once the time is up, the candle could automatically extinguish itself, ensuring safety.",
    "**Personalized Aromatherapy Candles**:    Offer customizable candles where customers can select their own combination of essential oils to create a personalized scent profile. This could be facilitated through an online platform where users can choose from a variety of base scents and add complementary notes. Each candle could come with a QR code that links to a suggested playlist or meditation guide that pairs with the chosen aroma, enhancing the overall relaxation experience.",
    "**Floating Candles with Aromatic Oils**:    Introduce a line of floating candles designed for pools or bathtubs that not only provide light but also release aromatic oils as they burn. These candles would be crafted from a waterproof material and would slowly dispense a soothing scent into the water, creating a luxurious spa-like atmosphere. Users could choose from different oil blends, such as eucalyptus for relaxation or peppermint for invigoration."
