    "**Self-Watering Feature**: Design a watering can with a built-in reservoir that automatically dispenses water into the soil based on the plant's needs. This can be achieved using a wicking system or a slow-release valve that adjusts the flow based on the moisture level detected by sensors.",
    "**Adjustable Nozzle**: Create a watering can with an adjustable nozzle that can switch between different spray patterns, such as a fine mist for delicate seedlings or a steady stream for larger plants. This would allow users to customize the watering experience based on the specific needs of their plants.",
    "**Collapsible Design**: Develop a collapsible watering can made from flexible, durable materials that can be easily stored when not in use. This would be particularly useful for urban gardeners with limited storage space or for those who travel frequently and want to take their gardening supplies with them.",
    "**Integrated Fertilizer Dispenser**: Incorporate a compartment within the watering can that allows users to add fertilizer or plant food. As the user waters their plants, the fertilizer would be mixed with water and dispensed simultaneously, ensuring that plants receive nutrients along with hydration.",
    "**Solar-Powered Watering Can**: Design a watering can equipped with a small solar panel that powers a small pump. This pump could draw water from a nearby source (like a bucket or pond) and deliver it to the plants, reducing the need to fill the can manually. This eco-friendly solution would also encourage water conservation."
