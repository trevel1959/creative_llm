    "Plant-Based Alternatives: One way to get essential vitamins and minerals without fruits and vegetables is by consuming plant-based alternatives such as algae, seaweed, and other types of green plants. These foods are rich in essential nutrients like calcium, iron, and vitamin C.",
    "Synthetic Supplements: Another option could be synthetic supplements that mimic the nutrient profiles of fruits and vegetables. For example, there are supplements available that provide high doses of vitamin C, vitamin D, and other essential vitamins and minerals.",
    "Genetic Engineering: Genetic engineering could be used to create crops that are specifically designed to produce high levels of essential vitamins and minerals. By manipulating the genes of certain plants, scientists could potentially create new varieties of fruits and vegetables that are more nutritious than their natural counterparts.",
    "Aquatic Foods: Fish and shellfish are a good source of essential vitamins and minerals, so if they were to disappear, people could turn to aquatic foods like seaweed, clams, and mussels for their nutritional needs.",
    "Soil Fertility Improvements: If fruits and vegetables were to disappear, it would also affect the quality of soil. To ensure that people still have access to essential vitamins and minerals, farmers could improve the fertility of their soil through practices like composting and crop rotation. This would help to increase the availability of nutrients in the soil, making it easier for plants to grow and produce healthy crops."
