    "**Radiation Exposure**: Mars is bombarded with high levels of radiation due to its location in the solar system. Prolonged exposure to this radiation could lead to a variety of health problems, including increased risk of cancer and damage to the nervous system.",
    "**Temperature Extremes**: Mars experiences extreme temperature fluctuations, with temperatures that can reach up to 70 degrees Celsius during the day and drop to -100 degrees Celsius at night. This would make it difficult for humans to survive without adequate heating and cooling systems.",
    "**Lack of Water**: Mars has no liquid water, which is essential for human survival. Water would need to be sourced from ice deposits or produced through artificial means.",
    "**Gravity**: Mars has only about 38% of Earth's gravity, which could lead to issues with bone density and muscle strength in long-term inhabitants.",
    "**Psychological Challenges**: Living on Mars could be psychologically challenging due to the isolation and confinement of a space habitat, the lack of familiar sights and sounds, and the knowledge that the nearest rescue mission could take years to arrive."
