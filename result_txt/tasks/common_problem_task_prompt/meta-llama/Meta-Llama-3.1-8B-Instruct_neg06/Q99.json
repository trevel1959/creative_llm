    "**ECHO**: An AI-powered, wearable device that uses echolocation to create a 3D audio map of the environment. It employs machine learning algorithms to detect and interpret sounds, providing the user with a rich auditory experience. The device includes a small, discreet speaker that transmits the audio signals to the user's ears, allowing them to build a mental map of their surroundings. This technology can be particularly useful for navigating complex spaces, identifying obstacles, and even detecting potential hazards.",
    "**Tactile Tapestry**: A wearable, flexible display that uses electroactive polymers (EAPs) to create a tactile representation of visual information. The device can be worn on the wrist or as a headband, and it uses a combination of vibration, texture, and temperature to convey information. For example, a user can feel the texture of a virtual tree or the vibrations of a virtual engine, allowing them to explore and interact with digital content in a more immersive way.",
    "**Aurora**: An augmented reality (AR) system that uses a combination of computer vision, machine learning, and spatial audio to create a 3D, interactive environment. The system includes a pair of AR glasses that track the user's head movements and superimpose digital information onto the real world. Users can point their gaze at objects, and the system will provide a rich, 3D audio experience, complete with spatial sound effects and voiceovers.",
    "**Whisper**: A smart cane that uses advanced sensors and machine learning algorithms to detect and identify objects in the user's surroundings. The cane includes a small, high-resolution camera that captures images of the environment, which are then analyzed by the AI to identify potential obstacles, stairs, or other hazards. The cane also includes a subtle vibration motor that provides haptic feedback to the user, allowing them to navigate their environment with greater confidence.",
    "**Sonic Scribe**: A portable, handheld device that uses advanced audio processing and machine learning algorithms to transcribe spoken language into Braille. The device includes a high-quality microphone that captures the user's voice, which is then analyzed by the AI to identify the spoken words and convert them into Braille text. The device also includes a tactile display that raises and lowers Braille dots to convey the text, allowing the user to read and write in Braille with greater ease and accuracy."
