    "**Water Recycling Systems**: Implementing water recycling systems can be an effective way to obtain clean drinking water. These systems can treat wastewater from various sources, such as domestic, industrial, and agricultural, and then reuse it for drinking or other purposes. This reduces the demand on natural water sources and helps to conserve them.",
    "**Atmospheric Water Harvesting**: Atmospheric water harvesting is a method of extracting water from the air, even in arid environments. This can be done using various technologies such as fog collection, dew collection, or condensation systems. The extracted water can then be treated and used for drinking.",
    "**Solar Water Purification**: Solar water purification systems can be used to remove impurities from contaminated water using the power of the sun. These systems can be designed to be portable and can be powered by solar panels, making them ideal for remote or off-grid areas.",
    "**Biosand Filters**: Biosand filters are a simple and cost-effective way to purify water. They use a combination of sand, gravel, and biological agents to remove contaminants. The filter can be built locally, making it an accessible solution for communities with limited resources.",
    "**Wetlands**: Constructing wetlands can be an effective way to clean water. Wetlands act as natural filters, removing pollutants and contaminants from water. They can be built around water bodies, such as rivers or lakes, to improve water quality."
