    "I would use technology to my advantage. I would invest in smart sensors that can detect changes in temperature, pressure, and other physical sensations. These sensors would alert me to potential dangers and help me avoid injury.",
    "I would develop a heightened sense of awareness through mindfulness practices. By focusing on my breath and body sensations, I would be able to detect even subtle changes in my surroundings that could indicate danger.",
    "I would rely on my other senses to guide me. For example, I would use my sense of hearing to detect sounds that could indicate danger, such as the sound of breaking glass or the sound of someone approaching.",
    "I would use my knowledge of physics and engineering to design and build safety equipment. For example, I could design a suit that would protect me from harm by absorbing impact or deflecting potential hazards.",
    "I would seek out people who have experience with physical impairments and learn from them. By seeking out individuals who have faced similar challenges, I could learn from their experiences and develop strategies for protecting myself from injury."
