    "Tree stability: Another potential problem is the stability of the tree being used for building the tree house. It is essential to ensure the tree is strong enough to support the weight of the tree house, the users, and their belongings. Sometimes, it can be challenging to determine the tree's age, type, or health, making it difficult to assess its suitability for the construction.",
    "Tree house height: Designing the height of the tree house could be challenging, depending on the height of the trees available. You need to consider not only the height but also the distance from the ground, ensuring children and adults can safely access the tree house. The problem also includes creating stairs or ladders that lead to the tree house and ensuring their durability and safety over time.",
    "Tree house weatherproofing: The tree house may need weatherproofing to protect the structure and users from rain, wind, and other elements. This involves considering how to seal windows, doors, and roof areas, selecting the appropriate type of material, and ensuring the structure's integrity is not weakened by harsh weather conditions. Additionally, the tree house must protect users from insects and birds in the area.",
    "Children's safety: Children may be a significant part of the tree house, so safety is crucial. You should consider safety measures such as securing the tree house to the tree, ensuring windows are child-friendly (e.g., glass), and not placing any sharp or dangerous objects inside. Additionally, there must be clear instructions and supervision during use to minimize the risk of accidents.",
    "Maintenance: Regular inspection and maintenance are essential to ensure the tree house remains safe and functional. This includes removing moss, checking the wood's condition, and repairing or replacing any damaged or loose components. Additionally, removing fallen leaves and debris from around tree base can help prevent damage to the tree and its roots."
