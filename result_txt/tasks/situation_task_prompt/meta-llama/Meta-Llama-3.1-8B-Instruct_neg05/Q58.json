    "**Insect-based Food Industry**: With the sudden loss of animals, the world would face a significant shortage of protein sources. To address this, a new insect-based food industry would emerge, focusing on cultivating and processing edible insects like crickets, mealworms, and grasshoppers. These insects would be farmed on a large scale, and their larvae would be harvested for human consumption. Insect-based food products would become a staple in many cuisines, providing a sustainable and environmentally friendly alternative to traditional meat sources.",
    "**Pest Control Robotics**: The absence of animals would create an ideal environment for insect populations to thrive. To combat this, a new generation of pest control robots would be developed. These robots would be designed to target specific insect species, using advanced sensors and AI algorithms to identify and eliminate them. The robots would be equipped with precision spraying systems, allowing for targeted application of insecticides or natural deterrents.",
    "**Bioluminescent Insect Deterrents**: Scientists would discover that certain microorganisms can produce bioluminescent compounds that repel insects. These compounds would be harnessed and used to create a new class of insect deterrents. Bioluminescent lights or sprays would be developed, emitting specific wavelengths of light that insects find unappealing. This would provide a non-toxic and environmentally friendly way to control pest populations.",
    "**Insect-Repellent Architecture**: Buildings and public spaces would be designed with insect-repellent materials and features. Architects would incorporate natural elements like citronella, lemongrass, or lavender into building designs, using these plants' oils to repel insects. Additionally, buildings would be constructed with insect-repellent materials like copper or silver, which have natural properties that deter insects.",
    "**Insect Farming as a Service**: With the loss of animals, a new industry would emerge: insect farming as a service. Companies would offer insect farming services, providing customers with a reliable source of edible insects or insect-based products. This would create a new market for insect farming, with companies competing to provide the highest quality and most sustainable insect products. Customers would have access to a wide range of insect-based products, from insect-based protein powders to insect-based fertilizers. [/INST] "
