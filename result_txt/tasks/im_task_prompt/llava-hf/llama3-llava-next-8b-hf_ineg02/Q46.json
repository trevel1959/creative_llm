    "Automatic Scissors: Create a pair of scissors that automatically adjust their cutting length based on the size of the object being cut. This could be achieved through sensors embedded in the scissors that detect the size of the object and adjust the blades accordingly.",
    "Smart Scissors: Develop a pair of scissors that have built-in Bluetooth connectivity, allowing users to control the cutting process through a smartphone app. This could include features such as adjustable cutting speed, precise cutting length, and the ability to save and share cutting patterns.",
    "Multi-Tool Scissors: Design a pair of scissors that incorporates multiple tools into the handle, such as a built-in screwdriver, can opener, and tweezers. This would make the scissors more versatile and convenient for everyday use.",
    "Scissors with a Built-in Light: Create a pair of scissors with a small LED light integrated into the blades, which would provide additional illumination when cutting in low-light conditions.",
    "Eco-Friendly Scissors: Develop a pair of scissors made from environmentally friendly materials, such as bamboo or recycled plastic. This would reduce the environmental impact of traditional metal scissors and make them more appealing to eco-conscious consumers."
