    "Fire pit: In a world without cooking equipment, a fire pit would be a valuable tool for preparing meals. You could use the fire to heat up rocks or stones, which could then be used to cook food. Simply place the food on the heated rocks or stones and let it cook for a few minutes on each side until it's cooked to your liking.",
    "Solar oven: If you have access to direct sunlight, you could use a solar oven to cook your meals. A solar oven works by using the sun's heat to warm up a dark-colored container filled with food. You can build a simple solar oven using a cardboard box, foil, and plastic wrap, or you can purchase a pre-made solar oven.",
    "Steaming: Steaming is a great way to cook food without any equipment. You can use a steamer basket to place your food in a pot of boiling water, which will cook the food through steam. This method is great for cooking delicate fish, vegetables, and grains.",
    "Smoking: If you have access to wood or other combustible materials, you could use a smoker to cook your meals. A smoker works by using smoke to cook food, which gives it a rich, smoky flavor. You can use a homemade smoker made from a metal drum or purchase a pre-made smoker.",
    "Fermentation: Fermentation is a process that involves using bacteria to break down food and convert it into a tangy, sour flavor.
