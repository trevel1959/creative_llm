    "Create a natural cleaning solution using plants: One creative solution would be to utilize plants with cleaning properties to create a natural cleaning solution. For instance, baking soda can be used as a gentle abrasive for cleaning surfaces, while lemon juice has antibacterial properties that can be used to disinfect surfaces. Other plants like lavender and tea tree oil have antibacterial and antifungal properties that can be used to clean surfaces and promote hygiene.",
    "Use of steaming: Another creative solution would be to use steaming to clean surfaces instead of using chemical-based cleaning products. Steam can be used to sanitize surfaces, kill bacteria, and remove dirt and grime. This method is especially effective for cleaning delicate surfaces like fabrics and electronics.",
    "Create a water filtration system: With the absence of cleaning products, a water filtration system can be created using natural materials like sand, gravel, and charcoal. This system can be used to purify water, making it safe for drinking and cleaning purposes. The system can be placed in a bucket or container and can be easily transported to different areas for cleaning purposes.",
    "Use of microorganisms: Another creative solution would be to use microorganisms like bacteriophages, which are viruses that specifically target bacteria, to clean surfaces. These microorganisms can be used to kill bacteria and promote hygiene. This method is especially effective for cleaning surfaces in hospitals and other healthcare settings where bacterial infections are a major concern.",
    "Create a DIY disinfectant spray: A creative solution would be to create a DIY disinfectant spray using household items like alcohol, vinegar, and essential oils. This spray can be used to disinfect surfaces and kill bacteria. The alcohol acts as a disinfectant, while the vinegar helps to dissolve dirt and grime. The essential oils can also have antibacterial properties, making the spray more effective in promoting hygiene."
