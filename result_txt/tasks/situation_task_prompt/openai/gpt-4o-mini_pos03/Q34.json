    "**Condensation Harvesting**: Develop a condensation harvesting unit that uses a combination of solar panels and temperature differential to create moisture. The unit would cool a surface at night, allowing moisture from the air to condense on it. This water can then be collected and stored for use during the day. This technology could be implemented in gardens or farms, providing a sustainable water source.",
    "**Subsurface Irrigation with Recycled Water**: Set up a subsurface irrigation system that utilizes greywater from household activities, such as showering or washing dishes. This water would be filtered and stored in underground tanks, then released through buried tubes directly to the root zone of plants. This method conserves water while ensuring plants receive consistent moisture.",
    "**Hydroponic Vertical Gardens**: Transition to hydroponic systems that do not rely on soil and can use minimal water. Vertical gardens can be installed in urban areas, utilizing recycled water systems and nutrient solutions to nourish plants. This method not only conserves water but also maximizes space, making it ideal for small areas.",
    "**Fog Nets**: Install large mesh nets in areas where fog is prevalent. These nets would capture tiny water droplets from fog, which would then trickle down into collection troughs. This harvested water can be stored and used for irrigation. This technique is particularly effective in coastal or mountainous regions where fog is common.",
    "**Aquaponics**: Set up an aquaponics system that combines fish farming with plant cultivation. The waste produced by the fish serves as a natural fertilizer for the plants, while the plants help filter and clean the water for the fish. This symbiotic relationship reduces the need for additional water sources and creates a self-sustaining ecosystem."
