    "**Plant-Based Alarm Clock**: Design an alarm clock that uses plants to wake up. The device would have sensors that monitor the growth and health of plants, and when the plants reach a certain stage of growth, the alarm would trigger. This would provide a connection to nature and promote a healthy environment.",
    "**Motion-Activated Alarm Clock**: Develop an alarm clock that uses motion sensors to detect when the user is moving around in the morning. The device would be equipped with accelerometers and infrared sensors that detect movement and trigger the alarm when the user is active. This would provide a more personalized and responsive alarm experience.",
    "**Scent-Based Alarm Clock**: Create an alarm clock that uses scents to signal the time. The device would have a built-in scent dispenser that releases a specific scent at set intervals throughout the night. When the scent is released, the user would need to get up to stop it, providing a gentle and non-intrusive way to wake up.",
    "**Smart Home Integration**: Design an alarm clock that integrates with a smart home system. The device would be connected to other smart devices in the home, such as lights, curtains, and temperature controls. When the alarm is triggered, these devices would gradually change state, providing a gentle and gradual wake-up experience.",
    "**Social Media Alarm Clock**: Develop an alarm clock that uses social media to wake up. The device would be connected to the user's social media accounts and would post a wake-up message or photo at a set time. The user would need to acknowledge the post to turn off the alarm, providing a social and interactive way to wake up."
