    "I would live in a treehouse, surrounded by nature and far away from the hustle and bustle of city life.",
    "I would live in a converted shipping container, which could be customized to suit my needs and be placed in a remote location.",
    "I would live in a tiny house, which could be built for a fraction of the cost of a traditional house and could be moved easily if needed.",
    "I would live in a houseboat, which could be moored in a scenic location and provide a unique living experience.",
    "I would live in a geodesic dome, which could be built quickly and inexpensively and could provide a sustainable and eco-friendly living option."
