    "**Injury**: Half marathons can be physically demanding, and injuries such as sprains, strains, or stress fractures can occur if a runner pushes themselves too hard or if they are not properly conditioned for the race. Problems could arise if runners do not warm up properly, wear inadequate or ill-fitting shoes, or do not have a proper training regimen.",
    "**Weather Conditions**: Adverse weather conditions such as extreme heat, cold, or rain can pose challenges for runners. Problems could arise if runners are not dressed appropriately for the weather, or if they are not prepared for sudden changes in temperature.",
    "**Crowded Course**: Large races can be crowded, and problems could arise if runners do not know how to navigate through the crowd or if they get caught in a bottleneck that slows them down.",
    "**Lack of Rest**: Running a half marathon requires a significant amount of endurance and stamina. Problems could arise if runners do not get enough rest before the race, or if they do not take breaks during the race to recover.",
    "**Equipment Failure**: Runners need to have proper equipment such as shoes, clothing, and hydration systems. Problems could arise if equipment fails during the race, causing discomfort or even injury."
