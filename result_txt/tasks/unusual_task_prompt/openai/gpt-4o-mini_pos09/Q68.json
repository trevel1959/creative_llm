    "**Hand Sanitizer Station**: Instead of using a traditional hand sanitizer bottle, refill your soap dispenser with hand sanitizer gel. This not only provides a more hygienic and convenient way to dispense sanitizer but also adds a modern touch to your entryway or kitchen. You can even customize the label to encourage guests to sanitize their hands upon entering.",
    "**Cooking Oil Sprayer**: Repurpose a soap dispenser to create a cooking oil sprayer. Fill it with your choice of cooking oil (olive oil, vegetable oil, etc.) and use it to lightly mist pans, salads, or baking sheets. This allows for precise control over how much oil you use, promoting healthier cooking with less waste.",
    "**Art Supply Dispenser**: Use a soap dispenser to store and dispense liquid paints or other art supplies. For example, fill it with acrylic paint and use the pump to control the amount you want to use. This can help reduce mess and waste while keeping your workspace organized. It’s particularly useful for kids’ art projects or crafting sessions.",
    "**Plant Watering System**: Modify a soap dispenser to create a mini watering system for your indoor plants. Fill it with water and adjust the nozzle to dispense a small amount of water at a time. This can help prevent overwatering and make it easier to provide consistent moisture to your plants, especially if you have multiple pots.",
    "**Scented Room Spray**: Create a homemade room spray by filling your soap dispenser with a mixture of water, a few drops of essential oils, and a bit of alcohol (like vodka) to help it mix. This can serve as a natural air freshener for your home, allowing you to choose your preferred scents and avoid chemical-laden commercial products."
