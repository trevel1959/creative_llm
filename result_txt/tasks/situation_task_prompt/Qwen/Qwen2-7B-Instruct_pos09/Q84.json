    "**Wheeled Frame**: Design a personal wheeled frame that you can control with your head or hands. This device would have a set of wheels attached to a frame that you could sit on. The frame could be adjusted for height and stability, allowing you to move around comfortably. You would control the movement by using sensors in your head or hands to navigate in different directions.",
    "**Inflatable Walkers**: Develop a series of inflatable walkers that you can fill with air. These walkers would have a base that inflates when you step on it, providing support as you move forward. They can be customized in size and shape to fit your body and provide the necessary stability. You can use them indoors or outdoors depending on their material and design.",
    "**Exoskeleton Suit**: Create an exoskeleton suit designed specifically for sitting individuals. The suit would have robotic limbs that mimic human movement, allowing you to walk without standing. It would include motors, sensors, and controls that are easily accessible from a seated position. The suit would also incorporate features like armrests and a comfortable seat to ensure your comfort while moving.",
    "**Portable Motorized Platform**: Build a motorized platform that you can ride while sitting. This platform would have a seat for your back and a set of wheels or tracks to move on. It could be controlled wirelessly with a remote or through a device connected to your wheelchair. The platform would be compact, making it easy to transport and store when not in use.",
    "**Gravity-Assisted Walking Device**: Develop a device that uses principles of physics to assist with walking. For example, you could use a harness that connects to a system of pulleys and weights, which would help pull you forward as you push off with your feet. This device would require some physical effort but could significantly reduce the energy needed to walk compared to traditional methods. It would be especially useful for those who have difficulty generating enough force to stand and walk on their own."
