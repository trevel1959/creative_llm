    "Inflatable Submarine: Design an inflatable submarine that can accommodate 5 people. The submarine would be powered by an electric motor and equipped with advanced sonar and communication systems. The inflatable design would allow for easy deployment and deflation, making it an ideal choice for deep-sea exploration missions. Confidence Score: 0.8",
    "Bio-Luminescent Submersible: Develop a submersible that utilizes bio-luminescent organisms to generate light. These organisms would be integrated into the submersible's body, providing a sustainable and energy-efficient light source. The submersible would also be equipped with advanced sensors and communication systems, allowing for real-time data collection and communication with the surface. Confidence Score: 0.9",
    "Underwater Glider: Design an underwater glider that can glide through the water with minimal resistance. The glider would be powered by a combination of solar panels and a small electric motor, making it an eco-friendly and energy-efficient choice for deep-sea exploration. The glider would also be equipped with advanced sensors and communication systems, allowing for real-time data collection and communication with the surface. Confidence Score: 0.8",
    "Autonomous Underwater Tunnel Borer: Develop an autonomous underwater tunnel borer that can create tunnels through the seafloor. The tunnel borer would be powered by a combination of batteries and a small nuclear reactor, providing the necessary energy for the complex and precise maneuvers required for tunnel boring. The tunnel borer would also be equipped with advanced sensors and communication systems, allowing for real-time data collection and communication with the surface. Confidence Score: 0.9",
    "Hydrogen Fuel Cell Submersible: Design a submersible powered by a hydrogen fuel cell. The fuel cell would provide a clean and efficient source of energy for the submersible, reducing the environmental impact of the mission. The submersible would also be equipped with advanced sensors and communication systems, allowing for real-time data collection and communication with the surface. Confidence Score: 0.8"
