    "**Integrated AR Display**: Incorporate an augmented reality (AR) display into the camera viewfinder or screen. This would allow photographers to visualize post-processing effects, such as color grading or cropping, before taking the shot. Users could also see how different settings (ISO, shutter speed, aperture) will affect the final image in real-time, enabling them to make more informed decisions while composing their shots.",
    "**Gesture-Controlled Features**: Introduce gesture recognition technology to allow users to control camera functions without touching the device. Simple hand gestures could zoom in or out, change modes, or trigger the shutter. This would be particularly useful for photographers in challenging environments (like underwater or in the rain) where touching the camera may be impractical.",
    "**Modular Camera Design**: Create a modular camera system where users can easily swap out components like the sensor, battery, and processing unit. This would allow photographers to customize their cameras for specific needs, such as enhancing low-light performance, increasing battery life for extended shoots, or upgrading image resolution without needing to purchase an entirely new camera.",
    "**Eco-Friendly Materials**: Design the camera using sustainable materials, such as biodegradable plastics or recycled metals. Additionally, incorporate solar charging capabilities, allowing users to charge their cameras using sunlight. This would appeal to environmentally conscious consumers and promote a more sustainable photography practice.",
    "**Virtual Photography Assistant**: Integrate a virtual assistant within the camera that provides real-time tips, tutorials, and feedback. Using voice commands, photographers could ask for advice on composition, lighting, or camera settings, and the assistant could analyze the scene to offer tailored suggestions. This feature would be especially beneficial for beginners looking to improve their skills."
