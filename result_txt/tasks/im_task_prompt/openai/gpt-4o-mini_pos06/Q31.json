    "**Modular Lens System**: Design a camera that allows users to swap out different lens components rather than entire lenses. This modular system could include interchangeable elements such as filters, zoom capabilities, and aperture settings, allowing photographers to customize their lenses for specific shooting conditions without carrying multiple heavy lenses.",
    "**Smartphone Integration**: Create a camera that seamlessly connects to smartphones via an app, allowing users to control settings, view images, and edit photos directly from their devices. This could include features like remote shooting, instant sharing, and enhanced editing tools that utilize the smartphone's processing power.",
    "**Environmental Adaptation**: Develop a camera with an adaptive casing that can change its exterior based on environmental conditions. For instance, it could switch to a waterproof cover for underwater photography or a heat-resistant shell for extreme temperatures. This would make the camera versatile for different settings and reduce the need for additional protective gear.",
    "**360-Degree Capture Mode**: Introduce a mode that allows the camera to capture 360-degree images or videos without the need for a separate 360-degree lens. This could be achieved through a combination of multiple sensors and advanced stitching algorithms, making it easier for users to capture immersive experiences without additional equipment.",
    "**Built-In Augmented Reality (AR) Features**: Incorporate AR technology that overlays helpful information onto the cameraâ€™s viewfinder or screen. This could include grid lines, exposure levels, and even real-time suggestions for editing or framing based on the scene being captured. It would enhance the user experience by providing context and guidance while shooting."
