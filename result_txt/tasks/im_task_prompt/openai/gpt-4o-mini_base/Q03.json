    "**Self-Cleaning Interior**: Introduce a self-cleaning feature that uses a combination of steam and UV light. After each use, the microwave could initiate a cleaning cycle where steam is generated to loosen food particles, followed by a UV light treatment to sanitize the interior. This would not only keep the microwave clean but also reduce the need for chemical cleaners.",
    "**Customizable Interior Shelving**: Design an adjustable shelving system inside the microwave that allows users to modify the height and position of the shelves based on the size of the food being heated. This could include collapsible shelves or rotating racks that accommodate different types of containers, maximizing space and efficiency.",
    "**Integrated Food Sensor Technology**: Equip the microwave with sensors that can detect the moisture and temperature of the food. This technology would allow the microwave to automatically adjust cooking times and power levels to ensure even heating and prevent overcooking or drying out food. A display could show real-time data about the foodâ€™s condition.",
    "**Dual Cooking Modes**: Create a microwave that offers dual cooking modes, combining traditional microwave heating with convection cooking. This would allow users to bake, roast, or crisp food while still benefiting from the speed of microwave cooking. A user-friendly interface could toggle between modes, and presets could cater to specific dishes.",
    "**Built-in Recipe Book with Touchscreen**: Incorporate a touchscreen interface that features a built-in recipe book. Users could browse through a variety of recipes, select their desired dish, and the microwave would automatically set the time and power levels. Additionally, the screen could display cooking tips, videos, and nutritional information."
