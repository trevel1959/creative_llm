    "Magnifying Glasses with Built-In Lenses: Invent a special magnifying glass with built-in lenses that can enhance vision without the need for glasses or contact lenses. These magnifying glasses could have different strengths of lenses, allowing users to adjust the level of magnification to suit their needs. They could also be equipped with a small LED light to illuminate objects in low-light environments.",
    "Smart Contact Lenses: Develop smart contact lenses that can augment vision by projecting digital images onto the wearer's field of view. These contact lenses could be equipped with a tiny display screen and miniature projector, allowing users to see virtual objects and information in their natural environment. The display could also be programmed to display important information, such as text messages, emails, or navigation directions, directly onto the user's field of view.",
    "Brain-Computer Interface (BCI) Glasses: Design a pair of glasses that can read brain signals and translate them into visual information. These BCI glasses could be equipped with electroencephalography (EEG) sensors that detect electrical activity in the brain and translate it into visual commands. Users could then use these commands to control the glasses' display, adjusting the brightness, contrast, or even changing the image entirely.",
    "Virtual Reality (VR) Visors: Create a VR visor that can simulate perfect vision for people with poor vision. The visor could use advanced VR technology to create a virtual environment that mimics the wearer's natural vision, allowing them to see objects and details clearly. The visor could also be programmed to simulate different lighting conditions, such as bright sunlight or dim indoor lighting, to provide a more realistic experience.",
    "Bionic Eye Implants: Develop bionic eye implants that can restore vision to people with severe vision loss or blindness. These implants could be designed to mimic the function of a healthy retina, detecting light and transmitting signals to the brain. They could also be equipped with advanced features such as image recognition software, allowing users to recognize objects and faces even in low-light environments."
