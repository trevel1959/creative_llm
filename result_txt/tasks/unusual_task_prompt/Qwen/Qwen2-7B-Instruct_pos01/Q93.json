    "**Incorporating LED Lights:** Design a vase that is hollow inside and has a compartment to hold LED lights. The lights can be set to different colors and brightness levels, creating an ambient glow when placed in a room. This idea can also incorporate different light effects like flashing or pulsing to create a dynamic display.",
    "**Sustainable Material Vase:** Create a vase made entirely from recycled materials such as glass bottles, plastic containers, or discarded wood. This not only adds a unique aesthetic but also promotes environmental sustainability. The recycled material could be woven together using traditional crafts techniques, creating a textured and organic look.",
    "**Interactive Vase with Sound:** Design a vase that plays music when water is poured into it. The sound could be programmed to play different melodies or even change based on the amount of water poured in, creating a personalized experience each time someone uses the vase.",
    "**Vase with Built-in Plant Care System:** Incorporate sensors within the vase that monitor water levels, pH balance, and sunlight exposure. These sensors would provide real-time data to an app on the user's phone, helping them understand how to best care for their plant, potentially extending the life of the plant and improving the overall appearance of the vase.",
    "**Magnetic Vase:** Develop a vase that has magnetic strips on its interior walls, allowing users to attach small objects like photos, notes, or magnets. This could be particularly useful for organizing reminders or personal items, especially in small spaces where wall space might be limited."
