    "**Eco-Friendly Birdhouses**: Design a series of birdhouses that utilize plastic bottles as a primary material. The bottles are cut, cleaned, and transformed into unique birdhouses with distinct shapes, sizes, and features. Each birdhouse is designed to attract a specific type of bird, taking into account their nesting preferences and environmental needs. The project aims to raise awareness about plastic waste and promote sustainable living through creative reuse.",
    "**Plastic Bottle Greenhouse**: Create a self-sustaining mini-greenhouse using a plastic bottle as the primary structure. The bottle is transformed into a mini-garden, complete with a built-in irrigation system, a solar-powered heating element, and a specialized growing medium. This innovative design allows individuals to grow their own herbs, microgreens, or succulents, promoting urban agriculture and reducing plastic waste.",
    "**Water Purification System**: Develop a low-cost, community-driven water purification system that utilizes plastic bottles as a primary component. The system uses a combination of solar-powered UV treatment, activated carbon filtration, and sedimentation to purify contaminated water. The project aims to provide clean drinking water to underserved communities, reducing the risk of waterborne diseases and promoting public health.",
    "**Plastic Bottle Wind Chimes**: Design a series of wind chimes that utilize plastic bottles as the primary material. The bottles are cut, cleaned, and transformed into unique wind chime components, each with a distinct sound and visual appeal. The project promotes creativity, sustainability, and a deeper appreciation for the sounds of nature.",
    "**Underwater Sculpture Garden**: Create an underwater sculpture garden using plastic bottles as a primary material. The bottles are transformed into intricate sculptures, which are then submerged in a designated marine environment. The project raises awareness about marine pollution, promotes sustainable tourism, and provides a unique habitat for marine life to thrive."
