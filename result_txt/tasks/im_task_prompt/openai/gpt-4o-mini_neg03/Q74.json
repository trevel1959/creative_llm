    "**Ergonomic Design with Adjustable Spout**: Redesign the watering can with an ergonomic handle that reduces strain on the wrist and hand during use. Additionally, incorporate an adjustable spout that allows users to change the direction and flow of water, making it easier to reach plants in tight spaces or hanging pots without splashing.",
    "**Self-Watering Feature**: Create a watering can that includes a built-in reservoir system. This system would allow users to fill the can once, and it would gradually release water into the soil over time through a drip mechanism. This would reduce the frequency of watering while ensuring that plants receive a consistent moisture level.",
    "**Integrated Fertilizer Dispenser**: Design a watering can that has a compartment for liquid fertilizer. When users water their plants, they can easily dispense a measured amount of fertilizer along with the water. This would simplify the fertilization process and ensure that plants receive the nutrients they need without the hassle of mixing separate solutions.",
    "**Color-Changing Water Indicator**: Develop a watering can with a color-changing feature that indicates the temperature of the water inside. The can could use thermochromic materials that change color based on water temperature, helping users to avoid using water that is too hot or too cold for their plants, which can stress them.",
    "**Built-in Plant Care Guide**: Incorporate a small digital screen or e-ink display on the watering can that provides users with a plant care guide. This guide could offer information on watering needs, sunlight requirements, and other care tips based on the type of plant being watered. Users could input their plants' names, and the can would provide tailored advice."
