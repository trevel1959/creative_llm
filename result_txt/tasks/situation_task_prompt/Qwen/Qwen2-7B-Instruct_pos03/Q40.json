    "**Solar-Powered Devices**: Create a system that utilizes solar panels to charge a battery pack, which can then be used to power various electronic devices. This system could include portable solar chargers for laptops, smartphones, and other gadgets. The design should focus on efficiency, compactness, and durability to ensure it's practical for everyday use.",
    "**Wind Turbine Power**: Develop a small-scale wind turbine that can generate electricity to power devices. This solution is ideal for areas with consistent wind patterns. It could involve creating lightweight, foldable wind turbines that can be easily carried or attached to backpacks or tents for outdoor enthusiasts and hikers.",
    "**Human-Powered Generators**: Invent a device that converts human energy into electrical power through kinetic energy. This could be in the form of a wearable device that harnesses energy from walking or running. Users could charge their devices by wearing this generator during daily activities, effectively turning their movement into usable power.",
    "**Bioenergy Converters**: Design a device that extracts energy from organic waste, such as food scraps or plant material, using microbial fuel cells. This innovative solution would allow users to generate electricity directly from their compost or food waste, making it an eco-friendly way to power their gadgets while reducing waste.",
    "**Thermal Energy Harvesting**: Create a thermoelectric generator that captures heat energy from the body or ambient surroundings to power devices. This concept involves integrating thermoelectric materials into clothing or accessories that can convert the heat generated by the user's body or absorbed from the environment into electricity. This could be particularly useful for wearable technology or remote monitoring systems where continuous power supply is needed without external charging."
