    "Create a virtual reality simulation of the deep-sea exploration mission to prepare the team mentally and physically for the actual journey.",
    "Develop a drone that can withstand the extreme pressure of the deep sea and capture high-quality images and data of the underwater environment.",
    "Use artificial intelligence to analyze the data collected during the mission and identify patterns and anomalies that could help in future explorations.",
    "Create a mobile app that allows people to track the progress of the deep-sea exploration mission and learn more about the underwater world.",
    "Use 3D printing technology to create replicas of the deep-sea creatures and plants that the team is likely to encounter during the mission, which can be used for educational purposes."
