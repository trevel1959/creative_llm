Regularly update these policies to address new vulnerabilities and compliance requirements.",
    "**Phishing Simulation Training**: Implement a phishing simulation training program that regularly tests employees' awareness and response to potential cyber threats. This could involve sending simulated phishing emails and tracking how employees respond. The results can help identify areas where employees need additional training, reinforcing their understanding of safe online practices and the importance of cybersecurity.",
    "**Cybersecurity Awareness Program**: Establish a continuous education program focused on cybersecurity awareness among all employees. This program should include regular training sessions, workshops, and online resources to educate employees about the latest cyber threats, best practices, and personal responsibility in maintaining company security.
