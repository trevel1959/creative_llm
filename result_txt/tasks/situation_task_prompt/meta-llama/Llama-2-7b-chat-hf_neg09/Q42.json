    "Build a shelter using natural resources: To start, you would need to find suitable materials to build a shelter. Look for palm fronds, leaves, vines, and branches to construct a lean-to or a debris hut. You can also use rocks, shells, and coral to create a wall around the shelter for protection from the elements. To make the shelter more secure, you can create a sandbag wall or use coconut husks to weave a thatched roof.",
    "Find a source of fresh water: Finding a source of fresh water is crucial for survival. Look for streams, rivers, or ponds near your island. If there are no natural sources of water, you can collect rainwater by placing a tarp or a large leaf on the ground to catch the rain. You can also dig a well or a pit to reach groundwater. Make sure to purify the water before drinking it using methods like boiling, filtering, or using water purification tablets.",
    "Start a fire: Fire is essential for warmth, cooking, and signaling for help. Find dry wood, twigs, and other flammable materials to start a fire. You can also use a magnifying glass or a piece of glass to focus the sun's rays and start a fire. Once the fire is going, you can cook your food, boil water, and keep yourself warm.",
    "Catch food: To survive on the island, you need to find a reliable source of food. Look for coconuts, breadfruit, and other fruits that are abundant in tropical islands. You can also catch fish and crabs by using a makeshift fishing net or a spear. If you're lucky, you might find a wild boar or a bird that you can hunt for meat.",
    "Create a signal fire: To signal for help, you need to create a visible fire that can be seen from a distance. Choose a hill or a high point on the island and build a fire there. You can also use a mirror or a shiny object to reflect sunlight towards any passing boats or planes. Create a smoke signal during the day and a fire signal at night to increase your chances of being rescued."
