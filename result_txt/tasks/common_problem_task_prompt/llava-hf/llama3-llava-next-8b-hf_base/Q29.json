    "Limited resources: Deep-sea exploration missions often require specialized equipment and resources, such as submersibles, remotely operated vehicles (ROVs), and specialized personnel. However, these resources can be expensive and may not always be available, which can limit the team's ability to fully explore the deep sea.",
    "Environmental hazards: Deep-sea environments can be dangerous due to factors such as extreme pressure, cold temperatures, and the presence of underwater hazards such as rocks, coral reefs, and marine life. These hazards can pose risks to the team and their equipment, and may require additional safety measures to be taken.",
    "Limited knowledge of the deep sea: Despite advances in technology and exploration, there is still much that is not known about the deep sea. This can make it difficult for the team to predict and prepare for the challenges they may encounter, and may require additional research and planning before the mission begins.",
    "Time constraints: Deep-sea exploration missions can be time-consuming and may require the team to spend extended periods of time underwater. This can be physically demanding and may require additional planning and preparation to ensure the team's safety and well-being.",
    "Limited access to medical care: In the event of an emergency or injury, the team may be far from medical facilities, which can make it difficult to receive timely and appropriate medical care. This can be a significant concern for deep-sea exploration missions, and may require additional planning and preparation to ensure the team's safety."
