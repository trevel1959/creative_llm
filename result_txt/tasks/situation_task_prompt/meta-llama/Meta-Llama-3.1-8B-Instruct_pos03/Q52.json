    "**Stone-Age Stir-Fry**: I'd gather flat stones from the riverbank and use them as makeshift cooking surfaces. I'd heat them over an open flame, created by rubbing sticks together or using a magnifying glass to focus sunlight. To cook the meal, I'd place a mixture of foraged vegetables, such as wild mushrooms and berries, onto the hot stones. The stones would distribute heat evenly, allowing the ingredients to cook slowly and thoroughly.",
    "**Terra Cotta Tandoor**: I'd dig a hole in the ground and line it with clay, creating a primitive tandoor oven. I'd use dry leaves and twigs to create a fire, which would heat the clay to a high temperature. Once the clay is hot, I'd place a mixture of meat and spices into a clay pot, sealing it with a layer of mud. The heat from the clay would cook the meal, creating a tender and flavorful dish.",
    "**Solar Oven**: I'd use a combination of natural materials, such as cardboard, aluminum foil, and plastic wrap, to create a makeshift solar oven. I'd place the ingredients, such as meat and vegetables, into the center of the oven and cover it with a clear plastic sheet. The sun's rays would pass through the plastic, heating the ingredients evenly and cooking the meal.",
    "**Grill on a Rock**: I'd find a flat, heat-resistant rock and use it as a grill. I'd heat the rock over an open flame, created by rubbing sticks together or using a magnifying glass to focus sunlight. Once the rock is hot, I'd place a mixture of meat and spices onto it, cooking the meal to perfection.",
    "**Mud Pit Stew**: I'd dig a shallow pit in the ground and line it with a mixture of mud and water. I'd place a mixture of ingredients, such as meat and vegetables, into the pit and cover it with a layer of mud. The heat from the sun and the earth would cook the meal, creating a hearty and flavorful stew."
