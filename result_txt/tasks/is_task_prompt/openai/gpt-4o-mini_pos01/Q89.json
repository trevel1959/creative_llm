    "In a lush valley, there lived a dragon named Puff who had an unusual problemâ€”he sneezed every time he was excited. One sunny day, the villagers planned a festival to celebrate the harvest, and Puff was invited. As the festivities began, the dragon couldn't contain his joy. With each cheer, a mighty sneeze erupted, sending colorful fireworks of pollen into the air. Instead of scaring the villagers, they were mesmerized by the spectacle. Puff learned that his sneezes brought joy, and from that day on, he became the festival's star, delighting everyone with his unique flair. ",
