    "**Modular Guitar Neck**: Design a guitar neck that can be easily swapped out for different scales, materials, or fret configurations. This would allow players to experiment with various styles and sounds without needing to invest in multiple guitars. Each neck could come with a unique set of features, such as built-in LED lights for fret markers or a detachable section that can be customized with different woods for tonal variations.",
    "**Integrated Learning System**: Develop a guitar with an integrated learning system that includes a touchscreen interface embedded in the body of the guitar. This system could provide interactive lessons, play-along tracks, and chord charts. It could also feature a virtual instructor that guides the player through songs, offering tips and corrections as they practice.",
    "**Smart Pickups with Tone Control**: Introduce guitar pickups that allow players to adjust the tonal quality directly from the guitar body. These smart pickups could be controlled via a small touch panel, enabling musicians to switch between various tonal settings (like humbucker and single-coil sounds) without needing to change their amp settings. This feature would provide greater versatility during live performances.",
    "**Sustainable Materials Guitar**: Create a line of guitars made from sustainable materials, such as bamboo, recycled plastics, or responsibly sourced woods. This initiative could not only appeal to environmentally conscious musicians but also introduce unique aesthetics and sounds. The guitar could also come with a certificate of sustainability, detailing the eco-friendly materials and processes used in its production.",
    "**Wearable Guitar Accessories**: Develop a line of wearable accessories that enhance the guitar-playing experience. This could include a wristband that detects hand movements and translates them into effects (like tremolo or vibrato) in real-time, or smart rings that allow players to control their effects pedals wirelessly. These accessories would enable musicians to express themselves more freely and creatively during performances."
