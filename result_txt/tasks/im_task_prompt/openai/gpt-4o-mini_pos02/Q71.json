    "**Integrated Sleeping System**: Design a sleeping bag that can seamlessly connect with a sleeping pad or air mattress. This could involve zippers or clips that allow the sleeping bag to attach securely to the sleeping surface, preventing it from sliding off during the night. The pad could also feature built-in insulation or even a self-inflating mechanism to enhance comfort and warmth.",
    "**Modular Design**: Create a modular sleeping bag that can be adjusted based on the user's needs. This could include removable layers for different weather conditions, such as a lightweight outer shell for summer and an insulated inner layer for winter. Users could mix and match components, allowing for a customizable experience that adapts to various camping scenarios.",
    "**Built-in Bug Netting**: Integrate a retractable bug netting system into the sleeping bag. The netting could be stored in a pocket within the bag and easily deployed to create a protective barrier against insects. This feature would be particularly beneficial for campers in areas with high mosquito populations, allowing for a peaceful night's sleep without the hassle of applying bug spray.",
    "**Self-Cleaning Fabric**: Utilize advanced materials that have self-cleaning properties, such as nanotechnology coatings that repel dirt, water, and odors. This would make the sleeping bag easier to maintain and more hygienic, allowing it to stay fresh even after multiple uses without the need for frequent washing.",
    "**Interactive LED Lighting**: Incorporate flexible LED lighting into the sleeping bag, allowing users to illuminate the interior without needing a separate flashlight. The lights could be activated by touch or voice commands and could change colors based on the user's preference, providing a cozy ambiance for reading or relaxing before sleep. Additionally, the lights could serve as a safety feature, helping to locate the bag in the dark."
