    "**Adaptive Touch Sensitivity**: Integrate pressure-sensitive keys that adjust their response based on the playerâ€™s skill level. For beginners, the keys could be more forgiving, allowing for a lighter touch to produce sound, while advanced players could benefit from a more traditional feel that requires more pressure. This feature could help in building proper finger strength and technique over time.",
    "**Integrated Light-Up Key System**: Implement a light-up key system that visually guides players through songs. Similar to \"Guitar Hero,\" the keys could light up in sequence as the player is prompted to play them. This feature would be especially beneficial for beginners learning to read music, as it would help them associate notes with their corresponding keys visually.",
    "**Customizable Sound Profiles**: Create a piano that allows users to customize sound profiles, including different instrument sounds, effects, and settings. Users could select from a variety of piano types (grand, upright, electric) or even simulate other instruments like strings or brass. This would encourage creativity and experimentation, allowing players to explore different musical styles without needing multiple instruments.",
    "**Built-in Composition Tools**: Design a piano with built-in composition tools that allow players to compose music directly on the instrument. This could include a digital display for notating music, recording capabilities, and even a simple sequencer for layering sounds. The piano could also suggest chord progressions or melodies based on the notes played, providing inspiration for songwriters.",
    "**Portable and Modular Design**: Innovate a piano that is modular and portable, allowing players to easily transport and reconfigure the instrument. Each section of the piano could detach and connect magnetically, making it convenient for traveling musicians. This design could also allow for different configurations, such as a compact version for small spaces or a full-sized setup for performances."
