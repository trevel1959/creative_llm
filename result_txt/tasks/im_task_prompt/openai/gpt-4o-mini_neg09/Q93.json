    "**Augmented Reality (AR) Coaching**: Develop an AR-enabled bowling ball that works in conjunction with a pair of AR glasses. As the bowler prepares to throw, the glasses overlay visual guides on the lane, indicating the optimal angle, speed, and spin for the best chance of a strike. This could include real-time feedback on the bowler's stance and release technique, allowing for instant adjustments.",
    "**Customizable Grip System**: Create a bowling ball with a customizable grip that allows players to adjust the size and shape of the finger holes. Using a simple mechanism, bowlers can change the hole configurations to suit their hand size or preferred grip style, enhancing comfort and control during play. This could also include interchangeable inserts made from different materials for varying textures and feels.",
    "**Impact-Absorbing Shell**: Design a bowling ball with an outer shell made of advanced impact-absorbing materials. This would minimize the risk of damage to both the ball and the lanes upon impact, allowing for longer-lasting equipment. Additionally, this could help reduce the shock felt by the bowler's arm during throws, potentially decreasing the risk of injury over time.",
    "**Integrated Performance Tracking**: Equip the bowling ball with embedded sensors that track metrics such as speed, spin rate, and trajectory. This data could sync with a mobile app, allowing bowlers to analyze their performance over time. Users could receive personalized training tips based on their statistics, helping them identify areas for improvement and set goals for future games.",
    "**Mood Lighting Feature**: Add a mood lighting feature to the bowling ball that activates during play. The ball could change colors based on the bowler's performance or current game state (e.g., a successful strike could trigger a celebratory light pattern). This would not only enhance the fun and excitement of the game but also create a more engaging atmosphere for both players and spectators."
