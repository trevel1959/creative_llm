    "Wind-powered technology: Set up wind turbines to generate electricity. This could be done by using the wind to turn the blades of the turbine, which would then convert the kinetic energy into electricity.",
    "Hydro-powered technology: Harness the power of water through a hydroelectric system. This could be done by using the natural flow of water in a river or stream to turn the blades of a turbine, which would then convert the kinetic energy into electricity.",
    "Biomass-powered technology: Use organic matter, such as wood or plant material, to generate electricity through a biomass power system. This could be done by burning the organic matter in a controlled environment to generate heat, which would then be used to produce steam, which would then drive a turbine to generate electricity.",
    "Bicycle-powered technology: Use a stationary bicycle to generate electricity. This could be done by using the energy produced by pedaling the bicycle to turn a generator, which would then convert the mechanical energy into electricity.",
    "Human-powered technology: Use the energy produced by the human body to generate electricity. This could be done by using a device that captures the energy produced by the body's movements, such as walking or exercising, to turn a generator, which would then convert the mechanical energy into electricity."
