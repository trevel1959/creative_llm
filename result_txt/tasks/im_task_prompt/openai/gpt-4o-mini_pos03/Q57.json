    "**Gesture Recognition**: Incorporate gesture recognition technology into the mouse. By integrating a small camera or infrared sensors, the mouse could detect hand movements and gestures above its surface. Users could perform specific actions, like scrolling or zooming, simply by moving their hand in a certain way, reducing the need for excessive clicking and providing a more intuitive user experience.",
    "**Built-in Touchscreen Interface**: Create a mouse with a small touchscreen on its surface. This interface could display customizable shortcuts, application controls, or even virtual keyboards. Users could swipe, tap, or drag on the touchscreen to perform various tasks, providing an additional layer of functionality without needing to switch between devices.",
    "**Wireless Charging and Battery Management**: Design a mouse that features wireless charging capabilities using resonant inductive charging technology. This would allow users to place the mouse on a charging pad to recharge without needing to plug it in. Additionally, integrating a smart battery management system that tracks usage patterns could optimize battery life and notify users when charging is needed.",
    "**Mood Lighting and Customization**: Equip the mouse with customizable RGB lighting that can change based on user preferences or application context. For example, the lighting could pulse with the rhythm of music during leisure time or change colors based on the intensity of work tasks. Users could personalize the lighting through software, creating a unique aesthetic that enhances their workspace.",
    "**Modular Design**: Create a modular mouse that allows users to swap out components based on their specific needs. For instance, users could change the sensor for higher precision, replace the scroll wheel for different tactile feedback, or switch out side buttons for customizable functions. This adaptability would cater to gamers, designers, and general users alike, allowing for a truly personalized experience."
