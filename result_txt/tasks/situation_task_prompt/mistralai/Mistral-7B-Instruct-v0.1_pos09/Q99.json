    "-digit system: We could assign a unique code to each object using a combination of digits. For example, a chair could be assigned the code 123, while a table could be assigned the code 456. This would allow us to differentiate between different objects even if they were all black and white.",
    "texture-based identification: We could identify objects based on their texture. For example, a chair could have a smooth texture, while a table could have a rough texture. This would allow us to differentiate between different objects even if they were all black and white.",
    "shape-based identification: We could identify objects based on their shape. For example, a chair could have a curved backrest, while a table could have a flat surface. This would allow us to differentiate between different objects even if they were all black and white.",
    "sound-based identification: We could identify objects based on the sound they make. For example, a chair could make a creaking sound when someone sits on it, while a table could make a thumping sound when something is placed on it. This would allow us to differentiate between different objects even if they were all black and white.",
    "weight-based identification: We could identify objects based on their weight. For example, a chair could be heavier than a table, due to its design and construction. This would allow us to differentiate between different objects even if they were all black and white."
