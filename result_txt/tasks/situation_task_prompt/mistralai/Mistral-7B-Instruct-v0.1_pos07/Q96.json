    "Beach Yoga: If all sand disappeared, we could enjoy the beach by practicing yoga on the smooth and flat beach surface. This would provide a unique and peaceful experience for those looking to relax and connect with nature.",
    "Beach Volleyball: Without sand, we could still enjoy a game of beach volleyball on the hard beach surface. This would be a fun and active way to spend time on the beach, and we could even experiment with different types of balls to see how they behave on the surface.",
    "Beach Art: We could use the smooth and flat beach surface to create art, such as sand sculptures or paintings. This would be a fun and creative way to enjoy the beach, and we could even invite others to join in and create their own art.",
    "Beach Music: We could enjoy the beach by listening to music, either by bringing our own speakers or by hiring a local musician to play live music. This would be a fun and relaxing way to spend time on the beach, and we could even dance to the music if we feel like it.",
    "Beach Picnic: We could enjoy the beach by having a picnic on the hard beach surface. This would be a fun and relaxed way to spend time with friends and family, and we could even invite others to join us for a picnic on the beach."
