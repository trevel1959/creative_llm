    "Create a shelter: To start, I would look for materials like palm fronds, branches, and rocks to build a sturdy shelter. I would create a lean-to structure using the branches and palm fronds, with a layer of rocks to provide extra stability and protection from the elements. I would also create a debris hut, using the branches and leaves to create a solid roof. This will provide me with protection from the sun, wind, and rain.",
    "Find a source of fresh water: As a deserted island is typically a hot and humid environment, finding a source of fresh water is crucial for survival. I would search for a nearby stream, river, or pond, or I would create a solar still to collect water from the ocean. The solar still would involve digging a shallow hole in the ground and placing a clear plastic sheet over it. I would then place a small stone in the center of the plastic sheet to create a concave shape, allowing the sun's heat to evaporate the ocean water. As the water vapor rises, it would condense on the underside of the plastic sheet and drip into a container for collection.",
    "Catch food: To catch food, I would use a combination of fishing and foraging techniques. I would create a makeshift fishing net using palm fronds and vines, and fish in the nearby ocean or stream. I would also search for fruits, nuts, and berries on the island, and set traps to catch small animals like crabs, lobsters, and birds. I would use a makeshift spear to hunt larger animals like pigs or deer.",
    "Create a signal fire: To signal for help, I would create a large fire on a hillside or cliff, using dry wood and leaves. I would also use a mirror to reflect sunlight towards any passing aircraft or ships during the day. This would increase the visibility of the fire and signal for help.",
    "Create a makeshift toolkit: To create a makeshift toolkit, I would use materials found on the island, such as rocks, sticks, and shells. I would use these materials to create tools like a hammer, screwdriver, and knife. I would also use"
