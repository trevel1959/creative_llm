    "Instrument-based performances: In a world without musical recordings, people could rely on live performances using traditional instruments. Musicians could gather in public spaces, such as parks or town squares, to share their talents with the community. These performances could range from solo acts to full-fledged ensembles, providing an opportunity for people to experience music in a more intimate and authentic way.",
    "Memory-based concerts: Another option would be to hold \"memory-based\" concerts, where musicians would perform songs that were popular in the past. These concerts could be held in historical buildings or cultural centers, and could feature musicians dressed in period clothing to add to the ambiance. People could sing along or simply enjoy the nostalgia of hearing their favorite old tunes.",
    "Community-based jam sessions: In a world without recordings, people could come together to create music collectively. Community centers or other public spaces could host regular jam sessions, where musicians of all skill levels could gather to play and improvise together. This would create a sense of community and shared creativity, as well as provide an opportunity for people to learn from one another.",
    "Visual scores: In a world without recordings, people could use visual scores to experience music. Visual scores are representations of music through images, symbols, or other visual elements. These scores could be projected onto a screen or displayed on a wall, allowing people to \"see\" the music being played. This could be particularly useful for people who are visually-oriented or have difficulty hearing music.",
    "Sound-based sculptures: Another creative solution would be to create sound-based sculptures that could be experienced through touch. Artists could create sculptures that produce different sounds when touched or manipulated, providing a tactile and sensory experience for listeners. These sculptures could be displayed in public spaces or museums, allowing people to engage with music in a more immersive and interactive way."
