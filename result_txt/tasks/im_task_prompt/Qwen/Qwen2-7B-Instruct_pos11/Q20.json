    "**Smart Coffee Brewing System**: Develop a smart coffee maker that can be controlled through a mobile app or voice commands (e.g., Alexa, Google Home). This system can offer customization options like preferred brewing temperature, coffee strength, and even suggest coffee blends based on your taste preferences. It could also provide reminders for when to refill water or clean the machine, ensuring optimal performance.",
    "**Eco-Friendly Coffee Maker**: Create an eco-friendly coffee maker that uses renewable energy sources such as solar panels or kinetic energy. The machine could have a built-in solar panel on top that charges during daylight hours or use kinetic energy from shaking or stirring beans to power the brewing process. This not only reduces environmental impact but also promotes sustainable living.",
    "**Multi-Function Coffee Maker**: Design a coffee maker that serves multiple purposes in addition to brewing coffee. For instance, it could double as a kettle, allowing you to heat water directly within the device. Alternatively, it might include features like a frother for making milk-based beverages, a tea infuser, or even a grinder for freshly ground coffee beans. This multifunctionality would make it a versatile kitchen appliance.",
    "**Portable Coffee Maker with Built-in Filter**: Develop a compact, portable coffee maker that fits easily into backpacks or briefcases. It should come equipped with its own filter system, eliminating the need for disposable filters. This product would be perfect for camping trips, office settings, or for people who enjoy a quick cup of coffee while traveling. It could also include a USB charging port for convenience.",
    "**Therapeutic Coffee Maker with Aromatherapy Function**: Integrate aromatherapy into the coffee brewing process by adding essential oil diffusers inside the coffee maker. Users could select their preferred oils (e.g., lavender for relaxation, peppermint for energy) to infuse the air with pleasant scents during the brewing process. This would create a more immersive and relaxing coffee experience, enhancing both the sensory pleasure and the atmosphere of coffee drinking."
