    "**Logistical Coordination Challenges**: Organizing an international summit involves complex logistics, including travel arrangements, accommodations, and venue selection. Potential problems include delays in visa processing, inadequate transportation options, or issues with the venueâ€™s facilities. To mitigate these issues, organizers should create a detailed timeline and checklist, establish partnerships with local travel agencies, and conduct site visits to ensure that the venue meets all necessary requirements for hosting an international event.",
    "**Security Threats and Protocols**: Given the high-profile nature of a peace summit, security threats could pose significant risks. Issues may arise from protests, targeted attacks, or unauthorized access to the venue. Organizers should collaborate with local law enforcement and security experts to develop a comprehensive security plan that includes access control, emergency response protocols, and contingency plans for various scenarios. Regular communication with participants about security measures will also be essential to ensure their safety and comfort.",
    "**Diverse Political Agendas**: Participants may come with differing political agendas and perspectives, leading to potential conflicts during discussions. To navigate this, organizers could establish clear guidelines for dialogue, focusing on common goals and facilitating moderated discussions. Additionally, creating breakout sessions where smaller groups can discuss sensitive topics may help in addressing contentious issues without derailing the overall summit.",
    "**Technological Failures**: Reliance on technology for presentations, live streaming, and communication can lead to issues if there are technical failures. Problems could include poor internet connectivity, malfunctioning equipment, or software glitches. To prepare for these challenges, organizers should conduct thorough testing of all technology prior to the event, have backup systems in place, and provide technical support on-site to quickly resolve any issues that may arise.",
    "**Sustainability Concerns**: Hosting an international summit can lead to significant environmental impacts, including waste generation and carbon emissions from travel. Potential problems may arise from backlash against the summit if sustainability is not prioritized. Organizers should implement a sustainability plan that includes measures such as using eco-friendly materials, minimizing single-use plastics, providing virtual attendance options, and offsetting carbon emissions through partnerships with environmental organizations."
