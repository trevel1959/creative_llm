    "Teleportation: Develop a teleportation technology that would instantly transport people from one location to another. This could be achieved through the use of advanced quantum physics or by creating a portal that can instantly transport matter from one place to another.",
    "Space travel: Develop a spacecraft that can travel to other planets or moons. This could be achieved through the use of advanced propulsion systems, such as nuclear or ionic engines, or by using solar sails to harness the power of the sun.",
    "Underwater travel: Develop a submarine that can travel to the depths of the ocean. This could be achieved through the use of advanced propulsion systems, such as hydrogen fuel cells or nuclear reactors, or by using sonar technology to navigate underwater.",
    "Maglev train: Develop a high-speed magnetic levitation train that can travel at speeds of up to 500 mph. This could be achieved through the use of advanced magnetic fields and propulsion systems, such as superconducting magnets or ionic thrusters.",
    "Space elevator: Develop a space elevator that can connect Earth to the Moon or another nearby object in space. This could be achieved through the use of advanced materials and propulsion systems, such as strong cables and solar sails."
