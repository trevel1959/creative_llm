    "Orbital Resonance: Redesign the solar system by creating a harmonious resonance between the orbits of the planets. Instead of the current eccentric orbits, the planets would move in a synchronized dance, creating a mesmerizing display of celestial harmony. Mercury, Venus, Earth, Mars, and Jupiter would orbit in a 3:2:1 ratio, while Saturn and Uranus would orbit in a 5:2 ratio. This new resonance would result in more frequent and dramatic celestial events, such as eclipses and planetary alignments.",
    "Gravity-Defying Planets: Imagine a solar system where the planets are defying gravity, floating in mid-air like balloons. Instead of orbiting the sun, these planets would hover above it, creating a surreal and fantastical landscape. The gas giants, Jupiter and Saturn, would be the largest and most massive, while the inner planets, Mercury and Venus, would be much smaller and more dense. This design would allow for unique and unpredictable weather patterns, as the planets would be constantly shifting and changing positions.",
    "Planetary Cities: Redesign the solar system as a sprawling metropolis, with each planet serving as a different district. The sun would be the central hub, with the planets radiating outward like spokes on a wheel. Each planet would have its own unique architecture, climate, and culture, creating a diverse and vibrant solar system. For example, Mercury could be a bustling commercial center, while Venus could be a tropical paradise. Mars could be a futuristic metropolis, while Jupiter and Saturn could be vast, sprawling slums.",
    "Living Worlds: Imagine a solar system where the planets are teeming with life. Each planet would be a self-sustaining ecosystem, with its own unique flora and fauna. The gas giants would be home to massive, floating cities, while the inner planets would be covered in lush forests and towering mountains. This redesign would allow for a diverse and thriving ecosystem, with each planet playing a vital role in the overall health of the solar system.",
