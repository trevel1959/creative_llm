    "Biometric Identification: In a world where traditional forms of identification have disappeared, biometric identification could become the new norm. This could include fingerprint recognition, facial recognition, iris scanning, or voice recognition. These technologies are becoming increasingly advanced and reliable, making them an ideal solution for verifying someone's identity without relying on physical documents.",
    "DNA Analysis: Another option for identifying individuals in a world without traditional forms of identification could be through DNA analysis. Everyone has unique genetic markers that can be used to identify them, and these markers can be analyzed using specialized equipment and software. While this method may not be foolproof, it would provide a high degree of accuracy and security.",
    "Behavioral Analysis: In addition to biometric and DNA analysis, behavioral analysis could also be used to verify someone's identity. By observing someone's behavior and mannerisms, experts could determine whether they match the person they are trying to identify. This method would require specialized training and expertise, but it could be effective in certain situations.",
    "Social Media Verification: With social media becoming an increasingly important part of our lives, it's possible that people could use their online presence as a form of identification. For example, someone could use their Facebook profile picture or Twitter bio to verify their identity. While this method would not be foolproof, it could be a useful补充 to other forms of identification.",
    "Written Test or Exam: Finally, a written test or exam could be used to verify someone's identity. This could involve answering questions about personal information, such as birthdate, address, or occupation. While this method may not be as secure as some of the others listed above, it would provide a way to verify someone's identity without relying on physical documents."
