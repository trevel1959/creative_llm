    "Nature-Inspired Wall Art: Since paint is no longer an option, you could create beautiful wall art using natural elements like leaves, twigs, and rocks. You could arrange them in a pattern or create a collage to add color and texture to your walls. For a more polished look, you could use resin to bind the elements together and protect them from damage.",
    "Light Installations: If paint is no longer an option, you could focus on using light to create unique and eye-catching decorations. You could use LED lights, glow-in-the-dark paint, or even fiber optics to create intricate designs and patterns on your walls. You could also use mirrors to reflect light and create the illusion of color.",
    "Fabric Wall Hangings: Instead of using paint, you could use fabric to create vibrant and colorful wall hangings. You could use brightly colored fabrics, patterns, or even embroidery to add texture and interest to your walls. You could also use a combination of fabrics and other materials like burlap or lace to create a unique and eclectic look.",
    "3D Wall Art: If paint is no longer an option, you could focus on creating 3D wall art using materials like clay, paper, or even recycled materials. You could create sculptures, mosaics, or even installations that add depth and texture to your walls. For a more modern look, you could use acrylic or resin to create sleek and contemporary designs.",
    "Chalkboard Walls: If you're looking for a more functional and versatile option, you could turn your walls into chalkboard surfaces. You could use chalk or markers to create messages, drawings, or even a daily to-do list. This would not only add color and interest to your walls but also provide a practical and useful surface for everyday use. You could also use a chalkboard paint to create a more durable and long-lasting surface."
