    "**Food Sources**: Surviving without a reliable food source poses another significant problem. The island may not have easily accessible food, leading to starvation. Foraging for edible plants, fishing, or trapping small animals could be necessary. However, identifying which plants are safe to eat and learning effective fishing or trapping techniques are essential skills that require time and knowledge.",
    "**Shelter Construction**: Exposure to the elements can lead to hypothermia or heat exhaustion. Building a sturdy shelter that protects from wind, rain, and sun is vital. This involves finding suitable materials such as leaves, branches, and driftwood, as well as understanding the island's geography to choose an optimal location away from potential hazards like falling trees or flooding.",
    "**Navigating Isolation and Mental Health**: The psychological impact of isolation can lead to feelings of despair, anxiety, or depression. Without social interaction, maintaining a positive mindset becomes challenging. Establishing a daily routine, setting small goals for survival tasks, or creating a personal project (like crafting or journaling) can help combat loneliness and keep the mind engaged.",
    "**Injury and Medical Emergencies**: Injuries can occur while foraging, building shelter, or during exploration. With no access to medical facilities, even minor injuries can become serious. Creating a first aid kit from natural resources (like using certain plants for antiseptic) and learning basic first aid techniques are crucial for treating injuries and preventing infections.",
    "**Signal for Rescue**: The lack of a clear communication method can hinder rescue efforts. Without a plan to signal for help, the chances of being discovered diminish. Constructing large SOS signs on the beach, using reflective materials to signal aircraft, or creating smoke signals with a fire can increase visibility to passing ships or planes."
