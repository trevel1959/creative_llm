    "Herbal remedies: One approach to treating a common cold without medication would be to rely on herbal remedies. This could include using natural herbs like ginger, peppermint, and eucalyptus, which have anti-inflammatory and decongestant properties. Ginger can help reduce inflammation and open up airways, while peppermint can help ease congestion and soothe a sore throat. Eucalyptus oil can also help ease congestion and promote easier breathing.",
    "Salt water gargle: Another way to treat a common cold without medication is through a salt water gargle. Salt water can help reduce swelling in the throat and loosen mucus, making it easier to expel. Adding a pinch of baking soda to the salt water can also help reduce inflammation and soothe a sore throat.",
    "Steam inhalation: Steam inhalation is another effective way to treat a common cold without medication. By inhaling steam from a bowl of hot water or a steam humidifier, mucus can be loosened and cleared from the airways, making it easier to breathe. Adding eucalyptus oil or menthol to the water can also help ease congestion and promote easier breathing.",
    "Dietary changes: A common cold can often be treated through dietary changes rather than medication. Eating foods rich in vitamin C, such as citrus fruits, leafy greens, and bell peppers, can help boost the immune system and fight off the infection. Drinking plenty of fluids, such as water, tea, and soup, can also help thin out mucus and promote easier breathing.",
    "Aromatherapy: Aromatherapy can also be used to treat a common cold without medication. Essential oils such as lavender, tea tree, and peppermint can be inhaled directly from a cloth or added to a diffuser to help ease congestion, promote relaxation, and reduce inflammation."
