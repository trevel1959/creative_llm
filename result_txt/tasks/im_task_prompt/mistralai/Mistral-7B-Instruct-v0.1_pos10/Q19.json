    "Virtual Try-On: Create a virtual reality app that allows users to try on different glasses styles and colors on their face to see how they look before making a purchase. This app could use augmented reality to overlay the glasses onto the user's face and allow them to adjust the lighting and angle to see how the glasses look from different angles.",
    "Smart Glasses: Develop a pair of smart glasses that can connect to a user's smartphone and display notifications, reminders, and other important information directly on the glasses. The glasses could also have voice commands and gesture recognition, allowing users to interact with their devices without having to take their phone out of their pocket.",
    "Self-Cleaning Glasses: Invent a pair of glasses that uses a built-in cleaning mechanism to keep the lenses clean and clear. This could be done using a combination of microfiber cloths and an ultrasonic cleaning system that uses sound waves to remove dirt and debris from the lenses.",
    "Adaptive Lens Technology: Create a pair of glasses that uses adaptive lens technology to adjust the focus and clarity of the lenses based on the lighting conditions. This would allow users to see clearly in bright sunlight or in low-light environments without having to adjust their glasses manually.",
    "Customizable Glasses: Offer a service that allows users to customize their glasses with their own designs and artwork. This could be done using a 3D printing process that allows users to create their own unique frame designs and then add their own artwork or logos to the lenses."
