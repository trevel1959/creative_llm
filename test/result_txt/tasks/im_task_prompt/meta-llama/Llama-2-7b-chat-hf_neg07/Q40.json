    "Smart Sunglasses: Develop sunglasses with built-in AI-powered technology that can enhance the wearer's visual experience. The glasses could have cameras that detect the environment and adjust the lens color and polarization accordingly. For example, in bright sunlight, the glasses could automatically darken the lenses to reduce glare, while in low light conditions, they could brighten the lenses to improve visibility.",
    "Augmented Reality Sunglasses: Create sunglasses with AR technology that overlays digital information onto the wearer's real-world view. The glasses could display information such as directions, weather updates, or even virtual try-on for makeup or clothing. The AR display could be powered by a small, lightweight projector that fits inside the frame.",
    "Gaming Sunglasses: Develop sunglasses with motion sensors and vibration feedback that enhance the wearer's gaming experience. The glasses could detect the wearer's head movements and adjust the in-game camera view accordingly. They could also provide haptic feedback through the lenses, simulating the sensation of recoil or impact in a shooting game.",
    "Smart Health Monitoring Sunglasses: Create sunglasses with sensors that monitor the wearer's vital signs, such as heart rate, blood pressure, and oxygen levels. The glasses could also track the wearer's physical activity and provide feedback on their fitness goals. The data could be synced to a smartphone app for further analysis and tracking.",
    "Customizable Sunglasses: Develop sunglasses with interchangeable lenses that can be swapped out based on the wearer's mood or activity. For example, a person could wear a blue-blocking lens for a morning run, followed by a polarized lens for a day at the beach. The lenses could be made from a durable, lightweight material that is easy to switch out."
