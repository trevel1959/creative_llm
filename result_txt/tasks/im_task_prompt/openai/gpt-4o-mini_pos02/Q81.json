    "**Multi-Functional Spatula with Built-in Measuring Tools**: Design a spatula that includes a set of measuring spoons and cups integrated into the handle. This would allow users to measure ingredients while cooking without needing to switch tools, saving time and reducing the clutter of kitchen utensils. The measuring tools could be retractable or collapsible to maintain a sleek design.",
    "**Ergonomic Spatula with Adjustable Handle**: Create an ergonomic spatula with an adjustable handle that can change length and angle. This would cater to various cooking styles and user preferences, making it easier to flip food in deep pans or on the grill. The handle could also have a textured grip to prevent slipping, enhancing safety during use.",
    "**Self-Cleaning Spatula with UV Light Technology**: Introduce a spatula that features a built-in UV light at the base of the handle. After use, the spatula can be placed in a designated cleaning station that uses UV light to kill bacteria and sanitize the surface. This innovation would make it easier to maintain hygiene in the kitchen, especially when working with raw meats or other potentially hazardous foods.",
    "**Color-Changing Spatula for Cooking Indicators**: Develop a spatula with a color-changing material that indicates the doneness of food. For example, the spatula could change from blue to red as food transitions from raw to cooked. This visual cue would help novice cooks gauge when to flip or serve their meals without needing to cut into the food.",
    "**Spatula with Integrated Storage Compartment**: Design a spatula that has a small, detachable storage compartment in the handle. This compartment could hold spices, herbs, or oils, allowing cooks to easily add flavor while cooking. The compartment could be sealed to prevent spillage and designed for easy cleaning, making it a convenient addition to the cooking process."
