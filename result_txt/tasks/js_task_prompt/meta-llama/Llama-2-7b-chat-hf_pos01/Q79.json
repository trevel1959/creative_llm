    "Flying Pods: A new form of transportation that would be a small, spherical capsule that floats and travels through the air using advanced magnetic levitation technology. Passengers would enter through a hatch in the top of the pod and be seated in a comfortable, zero-gravity environment. The pods would be connected by a network of magnetic rails, allowing them to travel in any direction and at any speed, making it a faster and more efficient alternative to traditional modes of transportation. Confidence Score: 0.8",
    "Hoverbikes: A new form of transportation that would be a personal, hovering vehicle that looks like a cross between a motorcycle and a hovercraft. The vehicle would use advanced electromagnetic technology to create a cushion of air around it, allowing it to hover and move in any direction. The rider would control the direction of the hoverbike using handlebars and would be able to reach high speeds, making it a fun and exciting way to travel. Confidence Score: 0.9",
    "Transparent Tunnels: A new form of transportation that would be a network of transparent, hollow tubes that would allow people to travel through cities and landscapes in a completely new way. The tubes would be made of a special material that would be virtually invisible, allowing passengers to see the world around them as they travel. The tubes would be connected to a central hub, allowing passengers to easily transfer between different routes and destinations. Confidence Score: 0.7",
    "Inflatable Trains: A new form of transportation that would be a train that inflates and deflates like a balloon to move through the ground. The train would use advanced air pressure technology to inflate and deflate its body, allowing it to move through the ground with minimal friction and resistance. This would make it a faster and more efficient way to travel long distances, while also reducing the environmental impact of traditional trains. Confidence Score: 0.8",
    "Gravity-Bending Cars: A new form of transportation that would be a car that uses advanced gravitational technology to bend and manipulate the gravitational forces around it. The car would be able to move up walls, across ceilings, and through solid objects, allowing it to travel through cities and landscapes in a completely new"
