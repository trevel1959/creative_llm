    "Water Supply: Water is essential for human life, but it is not readily available on Mars. Inhabitants would need to find a way to obtain water, either by extracting it from the Martian soil or by transporting it from Earth. This would require significant infrastructure and resources.",
    "Temperature Extremes: Mars experiences extreme temperature fluctuations, with temperatures reaching as low as -125°C at night and as high as 20°C during the day. Inhabitants would need to find ways to regulate their living spaces to maintain a comfortable temperature.",
    "Gravity: Mars has only about one-third of Earth's gravity. This would make everyday activities such as walking, eating, and sleeping more challenging and require adaptations to the body.",
    "Communication: Communication with Earth would be delayed due to the distance between the two planets. Inhabitants would need to find ways to communicate effectively and efficiently with Earth, considering the time lag.",
    "Radiation Exposure: Mars lacks a magnetic field, which means that inhabitants would be exposed to harmful radiation from the sun and space. Protective measures would be necessary to minimize radiation exposure."
