For instance, a \"Congratulations\" note could have a faint scent of success or celebration, while a \"Reminder\" note could have a mild citrus smell to help stimulate alertness. This unique twist on the classic post-it note will make it more enjoyable and memorable.",
    "Glow-in-the-Dark Post-It Notes: Develop post-it notes that emit a soft, glowing light after being exposed to light. This feature will allow users to easily find and read their notes in low-light environments, such as a dimly lit office or a nighttime study session. The glow-in-the-dark effect will also add a fun and futuristic touch to the classic post-it note.",
    "Edible Post-It Notes: Create post-it notes that are made of a non-toxic, edible material, such as sugar or cornstarch. These notes can be consumed after use, leaving no waste or mess behind. This innovative design will appeal to environmentally conscious individuals and those who want a more sustainable note-taking solution.",
    "Interactive Post-It Notes: Develop post-it notes with built-in sensors that can detect and respond to different stimuli, such as temperature, humidity, or even voice commands. For example, a \"Reminder\" note could vibrate when the user is nearby, or a \"Congratulations\" note could play a soothing melody when the user touches it. This interactive feature will add a new level of engagement and interactivity to the classic post-it note.",
    "Virtual Reality Post-It Notes: Create post-it notes that can be used in conjunction with a virtual reality (VR) headset. When a user writes a note on the post-it note, it appears in a virtual environment, such as a 3D virtual desk or a virtual whiteboard. This innovative feature will allow users to jot down notes and ideas in a virtual space, making it easier to organize and prioritize tasks, brainstorm ideas, or collaborate with others remotely."
