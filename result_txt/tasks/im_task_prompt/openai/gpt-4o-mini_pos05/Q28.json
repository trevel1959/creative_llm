    "**Modular Design**: Create a modular helmet that allows users to customize the helmet's features based on their riding style or conditions. For instance, users could add or remove visors, ear protection, or even detachable lights for visibility. This design would cater to different cycling environments, whether it's urban commuting, mountain biking, or road cycling, making the helmet versatile and adaptable.",
    "**Cooling and Ventilation System**: Design a helmet with an active cooling system that uses small, quiet fans or cooling gel pads to regulate temperature. This feature would be particularly beneficial for cyclists in hot climates or during intense workouts. The helmet could have adjustable vents that open or close based on temperature, providing optimal airflow while maintaining safety.",
    "**Eco-Friendly Materials**: Develop a helmet made from sustainable, biodegradable materials that provide the same level of protection as traditional helmets. This would appeal to environmentally conscious consumers. Additionally, the helmet could incorporate a recycling program where old helmets can be returned and repurposed, promoting sustainability in cycling gear.",
    "**Augmented Reality Visor**: Introduce a helmet with an augmented reality (AR) visor that displays critical information, such as speed, distance, and navigation, directly in the rider's line of sight. The visor could connect to a smartphone app, providing real-time updates without the need for the cyclist to look down at their phone, thus enhancing safety and convenience.",
    "**Personalized Fit Technology**: Create a helmet that utilizes 3D scanning technology to ensure a perfect fit for each individual. The helmet could adjust automatically to the shape of the user's head using inflatable bladders or memory foam, ensuring maximum comfort and safety. This technology would also allow for easy adjustments as the user grows or changes their hairstyle."
