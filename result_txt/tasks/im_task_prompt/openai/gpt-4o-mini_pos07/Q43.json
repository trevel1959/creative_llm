This oven could be equipped with a battery system that stores energy for use during cloudy days or at night, promoting sustainability and reducing electricity costs for users.",
    "**Virtual Reality Cooking Experience**: Incorporate a virtual reality (VR) component that allows users to experience cooking in a simulated environment. By wearing VR goggles, users could follow a virtual chef through the cooking process, learning techniques and tips while the oven monitors the cooking status in real-time, providing alerts when adjustments are needed."
