    "Smart Glasses for the Visually Impaired: Develop smart glasses that can enhance the vision of people with impaired vision. These glasses can use AI-powered algorithms to zoom in on objects, recognize faces, and provide real-time audio descriptions of the surroundings. They can also be integrated with other assistive technologies, such as canes or guide dogs, to provide a more comprehensive solution.",
    "Augmented Reality Glasses for Artists: Create AR glasses that allow artists to see their creations in 3D and in real-time. These glasses can project digital information onto the real world, allowing artists to visualize their work in a new and innovative way. They can also be used to collaborate with other artists, allowing them to see each other's work and build upon it in real-time.",
    "Glasses for Virtual Reality Meditation: Develop VR glasses that allow users to meditate in a virtual environment. These glasses can provide a calming and immersive experience, allowing users to escape from the stresses of everyday life. They can also be used to teach meditation techniques and provide guided meditations for users to follow.",
    "Smart Glasses for Athletes: Create smart glasses that can track an athlete's performance in real-time. These glasses can use sensors and AI algorithms to analyze the athlete's movements and provide feedback on their technique. They can also be used to provide real-time data on the athlete's performance, allowing them to optimize their training and improve their performance.",
    "Glasses for the Visually Impaired: Develop glasses that can translate written text in real-time. These glasses can use AI algorithms to recognize written text and translate it into the user's preferred language. They can also be integrated with other assistive technologies, such as voice-to-text software, to provide a more comprehensive solution for people with visual impairments."
