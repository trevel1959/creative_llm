    "Infrastructure challenges: The existing transportation infrastructure may be outdated, damaged, or inefficient, requiring significant investment in new or refurbished systems. This may include building new stations, upgrading existing tracks, and installing new technology to improve efficiency and safety.",
    "Traffic congestion: Overhauling the public transportation system may require the implementation of new routes or services to reduce traffic congestion. This may involve working with traffic planners and engineers to optimize routes and schedules to minimize the impact on road users.",
    "Accessibility: Ensuring that the new transportation system is accessible to all users, including people with disabilities, is an important consideration. This may involve implementing features such as wheelchair-accessible ramps, priority seating, and audio-visual announcements.",
    "Environmental impact: The overhauling of the public transportation system may have a significant environmental impact, particularly if it involves the construction of new infrastructure or the use of non-renewable energy sources. It is important to incorporate environmentally friendly practices into the design and operation of the system to minimize its impact on the environment.",
    "Public perception: The overhauling of the public transportation system may require significant changes to the way people use and interact with the system. It is important to manage public perception and ensure that the changes are communicated effectively to the public, to avoid confusion or negative reactions."
