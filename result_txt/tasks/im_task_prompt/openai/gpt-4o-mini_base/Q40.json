    "**Built-in Augmented Reality (AR)**: Develop sunglasses that incorporate AR technology, allowing users to access information through a heads-up display. For instance, navigation directions, weather updates, or even notifications from connected devices could be projected onto the lenses. This would provide a hands-free experience while keeping the user's eyes on their surroundings.",
    "**Modular Frame Design**: Create sunglasses with a modular design that allows users to easily swap out parts such as the arms, lenses, and nose pads. This would enable personalization in terms of style, fit, and functionality. Users could choose from various colors, patterns, and materials, or even replace damaged parts without needing to buy an entirely new pair.",
    "**Integrated Audio System**: Incorporate bone conduction technology into the sunglasses, allowing users to listen to music or take calls without the need for earbuds. This feature would keep the ears free and allow users to remain aware of their surroundings, making it ideal for outdoor activities like cycling or running.",
    "**Eco-friendly Materials**: Innovate the production of sunglasses using sustainable and biodegradable materials. This could include recycled plastics, bamboo, or other natural fibers that reduce environmental impact. Additionally, a recycling program could be implemented where customers can return old sunglasses for discounts on new purchases, promoting a circular economy.",
    "**Fitness Tracker Integration**: Embed fitness tracking technology into the sunglasses, allowing users to monitor their physical activity, heart rate, and even hydration levels. The data could sync with a smartphone app, providing insights into performance and encouraging a more active lifestyle, particularly for athletes and outdoor enthusiasts."
