    "memories: memories are the mental images and feelings associated with a particular event or person. If all photos and paintings disappeared, people would still have their memories to rely on. These memories can be as vivid and detailed as a painting or as clear as a photograph. People could use their memories to recall past events and people, even if they could not see or touch them again.",
    "written records: written records such as diaries, journals, and letters could be used to remember past events and people. These records could be kept in physical form, such as a stack of paper, or in digital form, such as a computer file.",
    "oral history: oral history is the study of the past as it is remembered by people. If all photos and paintings disappeared, people could rely on oral history to remember past events and people. This could involve talking to family members, friends, or historical figures to gather information about the past.",
    "artifacts: artifacts are physical objects that are used to remember the past. If all photos and paintings disappeared, people could rely on artifacts such as clothing, tools, or buildings to remember past events and people.",
    "technology: technology could be used to remember past events and people. For example, virtual reality could be used to create a digital representation of a past event or person, allowing people to experience it again. Alternatively, artificial intelligence could be used to analyze written records and create a database of past events and people, making it easier to access and recall information."
