    "**Modular Skateboard Design**: Create a skateboard with interchangeable parts that allow users to customize their ride according to their preferences or skill level. Riders could easily swap out wheels for different terrains (e.g., rough vs. smooth surfaces), change the deck shape for tricks, or adjust the trucks for tighter turns or stability. This would encourage creativity and personalization in skating.",
    "**LED Light-Up Deck and Wheels**: Design a skateboard with customizable LED lights embedded in the deck and wheels. Riders could choose different colors and patterns that change based on speed or tricks performed. This not only adds a fun visual element for night riding but also increases visibility for safety.",
    "**Eco-Friendly Skateboard Materials**: Develop a skateboard made entirely from sustainable materials, such as bamboo or recycled plastics. This skateboard could be marketed to environmentally conscious consumers and could include features like biodegradable grip tape and non-toxic paints. An accompanying app could track the carbon footprint saved by using eco-friendly products.",
    "**Skateboard with Built-In Bluetooth Speakers**: Incorporate Bluetooth speakers into the skateboard that connect to a rider's smartphone. This would allow users to listen to music or podcasts while skating, enhancing the overall experience. The speakers could be designed to withstand impacts and weather conditions, ensuring durability.",
    "**Skateboard with a Folding Mechanism**: Create a skateboard that can be easily folded for transport and storage. This design would be ideal for urban skaters who may need to take public transport or store their board in tight spaces. The folding mechanism could be reinforced to maintain stability and performance while riding."
