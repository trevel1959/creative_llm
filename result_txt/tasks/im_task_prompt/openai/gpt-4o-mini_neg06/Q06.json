    "**Self-Repairing Umbrella**: Utilizing advanced materials, this umbrella would be designed with a self-repairing mechanism. If a small tear occurs in the fabric, a special coating or material would activate and seal the tear automatically. This would greatly extend the life of the umbrella and reduce waste, making it an eco-friendly option for consumers.",
    "**Solar-Powered Umbrella**: Imagine an umbrella with built-in solar panels on its canopy. This umbrella could harness sunlight to power small devices like smartphones or portable fans. It could also include LED lights for night use, creating a multifunctional accessory that’s perfect for beach days, picnics, or outdoor events.",
    "**Convertible Umbrella**: This innovative design would allow the umbrella to transform into a sunshade or a tent. By adjusting the structure and using detachable side panels, users could create a comfortable shaded area at the beach or park. The umbrella would have a lightweight, portable design, making it easy to carry and set up.",
    "**Ergonomic Handle with Built-in Grip**: The handle of the umbrella could be redesigned to include an ergonomic grip that conforms to the user’s hand. Additionally, it could have a built-in anti-slip feature that ensures a firm hold, even in wet conditions. This would improve comfort and reduce the risk of dropping the umbrella during windy or rainy weather.",
    "**Reflective and Color-Changing Canopy**: This umbrella would feature a special fabric that reflects UV rays and changes color based on temperature. When it’s sunny and hot, the umbrella could change to a lighter color to reflect heat, while in cooler conditions, it would revert to a darker shade. This not only adds a fun aesthetic but also provides practical benefits for sun protection."
