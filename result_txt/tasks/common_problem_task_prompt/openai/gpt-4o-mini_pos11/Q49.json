    "**Intellectual Property Issues**: Developing a groundbreaking technology often involves navigating complex intellectual property laws. There may be existing patents that overlap with the new technology, leading to potential legal disputes. To mitigate this risk, conduct thorough patent research early in the development process and consult with legal experts to ensure that the technology does not infringe on existing patents.",
    "**Market Saturation and Competition**: The technology market can be highly competitive, with numerous players vying for attention. A game-changing technology might not stand out if the market is already saturated with similar solutions. To counteract this, conduct a detailed market analysis to identify unique selling propositions and potential niches where the technology can excel. Additionally, develop a robust marketing strategy to create awareness and differentiate the product.",
    "**Scalability Challenges**: As the technology gains traction, there may be issues related to scaling production or distribution. If the technology requires specialized materials or complex manufacturing processes, it may be difficult to meet increasing demand. To prepare for this, establish partnerships with reliable suppliers and manufacturers early on, and design the technology with scalability in mind to streamline production.",
    "**Funding and Financial Viability**: Securing funding for the development of innovative technology can be challenging, especially if investors are skeptical about its potential. There may be issues related to cash flow, budget overruns, or unexpected costs that can derail the project. To alleviate these concerns, create a detailed financial plan that outlines projected costs, potential revenue streams, and break-even analysis. Actively seek diverse funding sources, including grants, venture capital, and crowdfunding.",
    "**Technological Obsolescence**: The rapid pace of technological advancement means that what is considered \"game-changing\" today could become outdated tomorrow. This can lead to a situation where the technology fails to keep up with new developments or changing consumer preferences. To combat this, adopt an agile development approach that allows for continuous improvement and updates based on market trends and technological advancements."
