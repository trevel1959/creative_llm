    "The Starfish Sanctuary: A coastal town could build a sanctuary dedicated to the starfish that can walk on land, showcasing their unique abilities and providing a safe habitat for them. Visitors could learn about the starfish's adaptations and the importance of preserving their environment.",
    "Starfish Spa: A luxurious spa could be created specifically for the land-walking starfish, offering them massages, facials, and other treatments tailored to their unique needs. The spa could also offer services for humans, such as seaweed wraps and sea salt scrubs, incorporating the starfish's natural elements into the treatments.",
    "The Starfish Trail: A scenic trail could be created that takes hikers through the coastal areas where the land-walking starfish live. The trail could feature educational signs and interactive exhibits, allowing hikers to learn about the starfish's habitat and the challenges they face in their environment.",
    "Starfish-Inspired Architecture: A new type of building material could be developed inspired by the starfish's unique shell structure. This material could be used in the construction of buildings, bridges, and other structures, providing a sustainable and eco-friendly alternative to traditional materials.",
    "The Starfish Expedition: A scientific research vessel could be launched to explore the coastal areas where the land-walking starfish live. The vessel could be equipped with advanced technology, including underwater cameras and sampling equipment, to study the starfish's behavior, habitat, and population dynamics. The findings could help scientists better understand the starfish's ecology and develop strategies to protect their populations."
