Decorate with whimsical elements like teapots, mushroom houses, and fairies.

Kids can decorate their creations and enjoy eating what they've made.",

    "**Science Experiment Fete**: Organize a party focused on fun science experiments suitable for young children. Set up stations for simple experiments like making slime, creating volcanoes with baking soda and vinegar, or experimenting with magnetic properties.
