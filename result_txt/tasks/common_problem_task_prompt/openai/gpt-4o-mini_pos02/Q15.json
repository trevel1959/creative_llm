    "**Water Drainage Problems**: Poor drainage can lead to waterlogged soil, which can suffocate plant roots and encourage mold or root rot. Conversely, if the garden area is too dry, plants may not receive adequate moisture. To address this, consider incorporating raised beds or mounds to improve drainage. Adding mulch can also help retain moisture while preventing soil erosion.",
    "**Pest Infestation**: Gardens can attract a variety of pests, including insects, rodents, and deer, which can damage or destroy plants. Implementing integrated pest management strategies—such as companion planting, using natural repellents, and encouraging beneficial insects—can help control pest populations. Regular monitoring and quick action can prevent infestations from becoming overwhelming.",
    "**Inadequate Sunlight Exposure**: Plants have specific light requirements, and if your garden is located in a shaded area, it may hinder growth. Before planting, observe the sunlight patterns in your yard throughout the day. If necessary, consider relocating the garden to a sunnier spot or selecting shade-tolerant plants that can thrive in lower light conditions.",
    "**Climate and Weather Challenges**: Unpredictable weather patterns, such as late frosts, excessive heat, or heavy rainfall, can affect planting schedules and plant health. To combat this, choose plant varieties that are well-suited to your local climate. Use row covers or cloches to protect young plants from frost and provide shade during heatwaves. Planning for seasonal changes can help ensure a more resilient garden.",
    "**Limited Space and Layout Design**: A poorly planned garden layout can lead to overcrowding, making it difficult for plants to access sunlight, water, and nutrients. To optimize space, consider using vertical gardening techniques, such as trellises or wall planters, to maximize growing area. Additionally, create a layout that considers plant height and growth patterns to ensure that taller plants do not shade shorter ones."
