    "**Adaptive Eyewear Innovations**: Entrepreneurs and designers could focus on creating adaptive eyewear that doesn’t rely on traditional lenses. These could include smart glasses equipped with advanced optics and digital displays that can be customized for the user’s vision needs. Using technologies like liquid crystal displays or adjustable focal lengths, these glasses could change focus based on what the wearer is looking at, providing a more dynamic solution to vision problems.",
    "**Community Vision Assistance Programs**: Communities could establish programs where volunteers assist those with poor vision. This could include organized groups that help guide individuals in public spaces, read aloud signs or texts, and even provide transportation. This initiative would not only address immediate vision needs but also foster community engagement and support, creating a network of assistance for those affected.",
    "**Tactile Navigation Systems**: To help those with vision impairments navigate their surroundings, cities could implement tactile navigation systems. These systems would involve textured paths on sidewalks that guide users through public spaces. Additionally, buildings could install tactile maps at entrances, allowing individuals to feel their way around and locate important areas, enhancing independence and mobility.",
    "**Vision Rehabilitation Workshops**: With the absence of corrective lenses, workshops could be organized to teach individuals alternative coping mechanisms for their vision challenges. These workshops could cover techniques such as improving peripheral awareness, using contrast to distinguish objects, and enhancing spatial orientation. They could also provide training in using technology and tools that aid in daily tasks, fostering confidence and self-reliance.",
    "**Crowdsourced Vision Solutions**: Online platforms could emerge where individuals with poor vision can share their unique solutions and hacks for daily living without corrective lenses. This could include tips on using sound cues, relying on memory for navigation, or even DIY tools that help magnify text. By pooling collective knowledge, individuals could learn from each other’s experiences and find creative ways to adapt."
