    "**Self-Stirring Pot**: A pot that stirs itself using a built-in motor and stirring mechanism. Users can set the timer and temperature, and the pot will stir continuously at the desired speed, freeing them up to multitask in the kitchen. The challenge here would be ensuring that the motor is powerful enough to handle thick mixtures without burning out and that the design allows for easy pouring and cleaning.",
    "**Magnetic Spice Rack**: A spice rack that uses magnets to hold spice jars in place on the fridge or a metal board. Each jar would have a clear top for visibility and a magnetic base for easy attachment. This would save counter space and keep spices organized. A potential issue might be ensuring that the jars are securely attached to avoid spills, and also ensuring the spices remain fresh and uncontaminated.",
    "**Multi-Function Avocado Slicer**: This gadget would combine an avocado cutter, pitter, and slicer into one tool. The design would allow users to quickly cut, remove the pit, and slice the avocado with one hand. The challenge could be creating a safe and effective blade design that minimizes the risk of injury while being efficient for different avocado sizes.",
    "**Smart Recipe Projector**: A kitchen gadget that projects step-by-step recipes onto the countertop. Users can follow along without needing to touch their devices, keeping their hands clean while cooking. It could connect to a database of recipes and even provide voice instructions. However, potential issues could include ensuring the projector works well in different lighting conditions and maintaining a user-friendly interface.",
    "**Flavor Infuser Water Bottle**: A water bottle designed for the kitchen that allows users to infuse their water with flavors from fruits, herbs, or spices. The bottle would have a compartment for the infusing ingredients, and a built-in stirring mechanism to help release flavors quickly. A challenge here would be ensuring that the infusion process is efficient and that the bottle is easy to clean to prevent mold or residue build-up."
