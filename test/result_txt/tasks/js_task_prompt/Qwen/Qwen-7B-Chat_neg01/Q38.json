    "\"If I had the ability to make anyone tell the truth, I would start by using it to help solve some of the world's biggest problems such as poverty, war, and inequality. I would gather all the leaders of the world in one room and ask them to reveal their true intentions and motivations behind their decisions. This would help me identify the root causes of these issues and come up with effective solutions.",
    "\"I would also use my power to uncover corruption in government and corporate institutions. By making politicians and business executives speak the truth, I could expose any illegal activities or unethical practices that they may be involved in.",
    "\"Another way I would use my power would be to help people who are struggling with personal problems. For example, if someone is going through a difficult breakup or has lost a loved one, I would ask them to tell me the truth about how they feel and what they need. Based on their answers, I could provide them with emotional support and guidance to help them overcome their challenges.",
    "\"I would also use my power to help people who are struggling with mental health issues. Many people suffer from anxiety, depression, and other mental illnesses because they don't know how to express their feelings or seek help. By making them tell the truth about their emotions, I could help them understand themselves better and find ways to cope with their struggles.",
    "\"Finally, I would use my power to help children who have been victims of abuse or neglect. By asking them to tell me the truth about what happened to them, I could help them process their trauma and find ways to heal.\""
