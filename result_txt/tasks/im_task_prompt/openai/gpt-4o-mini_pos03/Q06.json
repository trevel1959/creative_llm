    "**UV Protection Layer**: Enhance the umbrella with a special UV-reflective coating on the fabric. This layer would not only shield users from rain but also provide protection against harmful UV rays on sunny days. The umbrella could have a dual mode: one for rain and one for sun, automatically adjusting the fabric’s properties based on the weather conditions.",
    "**Self-Cleaning Technology**: Introduce a self-cleaning mechanism using nanotechnology. The umbrella's fabric could be treated with a special coating that repels dirt and water, preventing stains and making it easy to clean. This would keep the umbrella looking new for longer and reduce maintenance for users.",
    "**Portable Solar Charger**: Equip the umbrella with lightweight solar panels that can charge small devices like smartphones and tablets. This would allow users to stay connected even in inclement weather. The solar charger could be integrated into the handle, providing an eco-friendly power source for on-the-go charging.",
    "**Expandable Canopy**: Design an umbrella with an expandable canopy that can adjust its size based on the number of people underneath. The user could pull a cord or press a button to increase the umbrella’s diameter, making it suitable for groups or families, ensuring everyone stays dry without needing multiple umbrellas.",
    "**Built-in LED Lighting**: Incorporate LED lights into the ribs of the umbrella for nighttime visibility. These lights could be activated by a simple switch on the handle, providing illumination for the user while walking in the dark. Additionally, the lights could change colors to signal different weather alerts, enhancing safety during storms."
