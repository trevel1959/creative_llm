    "**Self-Cleaning Functionality**: Introduce a self-cleaning feature that uses a combination of ultrasonic waves and steam to remove limescale and other deposits inside the kettle. This would not only prolong the kettle's lifespan but also ensure that every brew is as fresh and flavorful as possible. The user could activate the cleaning cycle with a simple button press or through the app.",
    "**Multi-Use Brewing Function**: Transform the kettle into a multi-functional brewing device that can steep tea, brew coffee, and even make instant soups. By including different infusion baskets or filters that can be swapped out, users can prepare various beverages and foods without needing additional equipment. The kettle could also have preset programs for different drinks, ensuring optimal brewing conditions.",
    "**Built-in Water Filter System**: Incorporate a water filtration system within the kettle that purifies tap water before boiling. This would enhance the taste of beverages by removing impurities and chlorine, leading to a better overall experience. Users could replace the filter periodically, and the kettle could have an indicator to alert them when it's time for a change.",
    "**Eco-Friendly Energy Management**: Equip the kettle with a solar charging option or an energy-efficient mode that reduces power consumption. The kettle could use a combination of solar panels and a rechargeable battery, allowing it to function off-grid in sunny locations. An energy consumption tracker could also provide insights into usage patterns and suggest ways to save energy.",
    "**Customizable LED Lighting**: Add an ambient LED lighting feature that changes color based on the temperature of the water. For instance, blue for cold, green for warm, and red for boiling. This not only provides a visual cue for users but also adds a modern aesthetic to the kitchen. The lighting could also be customizable through the app, allowing users to choose their favorite colors or set specific moods."
