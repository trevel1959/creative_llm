    "Dream Control for Therapy: If we could control our dreams, we could use them as a tool for therapy. By guiding individuals through specific dreamscapes, we could help them confront and overcome their fears, anxieties, and traumas. For example, a person who has a fear of heights could be taken on a dream journey to a tall mountain top and gradually overcome their fear.",
