    "Inexperience in developing VR training programs: Creating a virtual reality training program requires technical expertise and experience. If the individuals responsible for developing the program do not have the necessary skills, it could result in a subpar product that does not effectively engage or educate the learners.",
    "Insufficient data collection and analysis: To create an effective virtual reality training program, it is crucial to collect relevant data and analyze it to identify the learners' needs, preferences, and learning styles. If this critical step is overlooked, it could lead to a program that does not effectively address the learners' needs, resulting in low engagement and motivation.",
    "Limited accessibility: Ensuring that the virtual reality training program is accessible to all learners, regardless of their physical or cognitive abilities, is crucial. If the program is not designed with accessibility in mind, it could exacerbate existing inequalities and limit the program's effectiveness.",
    "Lack of ongoing support: Once the virtual reality training program is developed, it is essential to provide ongoing support to the learners to ensure they continue to learn and develop their skills. If there is no provision for ongoing support, it could lead to learners becoming disengaged and failing to retain the knowledge they have gained.",
    "Inadequate assessment and evaluation methods: To ensure the virtual reality training program is effective, it is crucial to have appropriate methods of assessment and evaluation in place. If these methods are not well-designed, it could cause difficulties in determining the program's effectiveness and identifying areas for improvement."
