    "**Pet Toy with a Twist**: Create a fun and interactive pet toy by cutting a small slit in the tennis ball and inserting treats or kibble inside. This encourages your pet to roll the ball around to get the treats out, promoting exercise and mental stimulation. You can even add a squeaker inside for added fun!",
    "**Doorstop**: Use a tennis ball as a doorstop by cutting a small slice off one side to create a flat base. This will allow the ball to sit securely against the door, preventing it from closing. It’s a colorful and playful alternative to traditional doorstops, and it can be easily moved when not in use.",
    "**Shoe Deodorizer**: Place a tennis ball inside your shoes when you're not wearing them to help absorb moisture and odors. The felt material helps to wick away moisture, while the round shape allows for good air circulation. For added freshness, you can even apply a few drops of essential oil to the ball before placing it in your shoes.",
    "**Golf Ball Substitute**: If you’re practicing your golf swing at home, use a tennis ball as a stand-in for a golf ball. This allows you to practice your swings without the risk of breaking anything in your home or yard. The larger size also helps you to focus on your swing technique without the intimidation of a smaller golf ball.",
    "**Couch Cushion Helper**: Cut a small slit in a tennis ball and insert it into the corner of your couch cushions. This can help to keep the cushions from slipping and sliding around, creating a more comfortable seating area. The ball's round shape allows it to fit snugly in the corners, providing stability without being visible."
