    "In a world where dragons were the rulers of the skies, there lived a Sneezy Dragon named Sniff. Unlike the other dragons, Sniff's sneezes were not just loud but also magical. With a single sneeze, he could heal the sick, lift the spirits of the downtrodden, and even put out fires. But one day, a wicked sorcerer sought to use Sniff's powers for his own gain. He captured Sniff and forced him to sneeze into a magical potion that granted him immense power. However, Sniff's sneezes became uncontrollable, causing chaos and destruction wherever he went. The people of the land begged for his release, and the sorcerer, seeing the destruction he had caused, finally freed Sniff, who vowed to use his powers for good from then on.",

    "The Sneezy Dragon was a young dragon who lived in a small cave on the outskirts of a bustling city. Unlike the other dragons, Sniff was not fierce or intimidating but instead had a playful and mischievous side. One day, a group of children stumbled upon his cave and were amazed by his size and appearance. Sniff, sensing their fear, decided to have some fun and began to sneeze, causing the children to laugh and play with him. The children and Sniff became fast friends, and the dragon would sneak into the city at night to play with them.
