    "**Atmospheric Water Harvesting**: Develop a system that condenses and collects water vapor from the clouds, creating a network of transparent, water-filled tubes that crisscross the city. As the water flows through these tubes, it would be heated by the warmth of the cloudy sky, generating a gentle, diffuse light that illuminates the surroundings.",
    "**Cloud-Sourced Bioluminescence**: Engineer microorganisms that can thrive in the cloudy environment and emit a soft, blue-green glow. These organisms would be integrated into urban infrastructure, such as buildings, streets, and public spaces, providing a sustainable and organic lighting solution.",
    "**Solar-Powered Mirrors**: Design and deploy a network of mirrors that can be adjusted to reflect and concentrate the limited sunlight available on cloudy days. These mirrors would be strategically placed to maximize the amount of light reflected onto specific areas, such as streets, parks, or public spaces.",
    "**Light-Emitting Fog**: Develop a system that generates a fine, artificial fog that can be infused with light-emitting particles. This fog would be released into the atmosphere on cloudy days, creating a soft, ethereal glow that illuminates the surroundings.",
    "**Cloud-Optimized Urban Planning**: Redesign urban infrastructure to take advantage of the cloudy environment. Buildings and public spaces would be designed with large, south-facing windows and transparent roofs to maximize the amount of indirect sunlight that enters. The urban layout would be optimized to channel and concentrate the limited sunlight available, creating a network of bright, sunny spots throughout the city.
