    "**Eco-friendly Tissue Box Holder**: Design a tissue box holder that is not only functional but also eco-friendly. You can create a holder using recycled materials such as old newspapers or cardboard boxes. Paint it in vibrant colors to add a pop of color to any room. The holder could be designed with a slot for easy access to tissues while keeping the mess contained within.",
    "**DIY Scented Tissues**: Add an aromatic touch to your everyday life by creating scented tissues. Simply mix essential oils (like lavender, lemon, or peppermint) with water in a spray bottle, then soak your tissues in this solution. This not only makes them smell delightful but also provides a quick way to freshen up your space when needed.",
    "**Interactive Tissue Box Game**: Transform a tissue box into a fun game for children or adults alike. Cut out sections of the box to reveal a hidden maze, and place small prizes or treats inside each section. Players can use the tissues to navigate through the maze, making it a playful and engaging activity that encourages problem-solving skills.",
    "**Personalized Tissue Box Cover**: Create a unique cover for your tissue box that reflects your personal style or interests. Use fabric, paint, or even digital printing to customize the cover. Attach Velcro strips on the back of the cover and on the tissue box for easy attachment and removal. This allows you to change the design as often as you like, keeping your space looking fresh and updated.",
    "**Health-conscious Tissue Box Dispenser**: Design a tissue box dispenser that promotes healthy habits. Include a feature that automatically dispenses tissues upon contact, reducing the need for frequent touching. Additionally, consider incorporating a UV light inside the dispenser to disinfect the tissues before they are used, enhancing hygiene and cleanliness. This innovative approach would be particularly useful in public spaces or shared environments."
