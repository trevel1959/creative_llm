    "Invent a pollinator robot: Create a small robot that can move around and collect pollen from one plant to another. The robot can be equipped with a small brush or suction device to collect pollen, and can be programmed to move between plants in a specific pattern to ensure efficient pollination.",
    "Use drones for pollination: Develop drones that can be programmed to fly over plants and collect pollen. The drones can be equipped with a small brush or suction device to collect pollen, and can be programmed to fly between plants in a specific pattern to ensure efficient pollination.",
    "Utilize wind for pollination: Create a device that can harness the power of wind to pollinate plants. The device can be placed near the plants and can be programmed to release pollen into the wind, ensuring that the pollen is carried to other plants for pollination.",
    "Develop a pollination app: Create an app that can be used to track the pollination of plants. The app can be programmed to monitor the weather and pollen levels, and can provide recommendations on when to pollinate plants to ensure optimal results.",
    "Use genetic engineering for pollination: Use genetic engineering to create plants that are more efficient at pollination. This can involve modifying the plants to produce more pollen or to produce pollen that is more easily carried by the wind or other pollinators."
