    "**Interchangeable Plates**:    Design the sandwich toaster with interchangeable plates that can accommodate different types of sandwiches, such as paninis, wraps, or even desserts like s'mores. Each plate would have a unique design that caters to the specific sandwich type, ensuring even heating and optimal texture. This feature would make the toaster more versatile and appealing to a broader audience.",
    "**Built-in Ingredient Dispenser**:    Incorporate a built-in ingredient dispenser that allows users to add fillings directly into the sandwich while it toasts. The dispenser could hold various ingredients, such as cheese, vegetables, or sauces, and dispense them evenly as the sandwich cooks. This would eliminate the mess of preparing sandwiches and provide a seamless cooking experience.",
    "**Dual-Sided Cooking**:    Create a sandwich toaster that can cook two sandwiches simultaneously on both sides, utilizing a dual-sided heating element. This design would allow users to prepare more sandwiches in less time, making it ideal for families or gatherings. The appliance could also have a divider to prevent ingredients from mixing, ensuring each sandwich retains its unique flavor.",
    "**Cleaning and Maintenance Features**:    Introduce a self-cleaning function that uses steam to sanitize the cooking plates after use. Users would simply fill a designated water reservoir, and the toaster would heat the water to create steam, loosening food residue for easy wipe-down. Additionally, removable, dishwasher-safe plates would enhance convenience and make cleaning a breeze.",
    "**Eco-Friendly Design**:    Develop a sandwich toaster made from sustainable materials, such as bamboo or recycled plastics, to appeal to environmentally conscious consumers. Furthermore, incorporate energy-efficient heating elements that reduce power consumption. The packaging could also be made from biodegradable materials, promoting a zero-waste lifestyle."
