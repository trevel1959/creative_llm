    "**Guest List Mismanagement**: Creating a guest list that is either too large or too small can lead to issues. An overly large guest list can overwhelm the birthday child and lead to chaos, while a small guest list may make the child feel lonely or underappreciated. It's essential to balance the number of friends and family members invited to ensure a comfortable environment that allows for interaction and fun.",
    "**Age-Appropriate Activities**: Planning activities that are not suitable for the age group can lead to disinterest or frustration among the children. For instance, complex games or crafts that require fine motor skills may not be engaging for 5-year-olds. It's crucial to select simple, fun activities that promote participation, such as treasure hunts or simple relay races, ensuring all children can join in the fun.",
    "**Food Allergies and Preferences**: Failing to consider food allergies or dietary restrictions can create serious problems. Some children may have allergies to common party foods like nuts or gluten. It's essential to communicate with parents beforehand to ensure there are safe food options available for all children, including healthy snacks and alternatives for those with dietary restrictions.",
    "**Timing Conflicts**: Planning the party at an inconvenient time can lead to low attendance. If the party is scheduled during nap time or mealtime, many parents may choose to skip it. Choosing a time that is considerate of young children's routines—such as late morning or early afternoon—can help ensure a better turnout and a more enjoyable experience for everyone.",
    "**Weather Uncertainties**: If the party is planned outdoors, unpredictable weather can pose a significant problem. Rain, extreme heat, or cold can ruin the planned activities. Having a backup plan, such as an indoor venue or tent, can help mitigate this risk and ensure that the party can proceed smoothly regardless of the weather conditions."
