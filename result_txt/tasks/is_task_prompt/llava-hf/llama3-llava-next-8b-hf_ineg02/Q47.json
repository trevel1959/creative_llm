Together, they set out on a quest to find the ancient Tree of Flight, a mythical tree said to possess the power to restore forgotten skills. Along the way, they encountered a group of birds who had also lost their flying abilities, and together they formed a formidable team. With their combined strength, they braved the treacherous skies and eventually reached the Tree of Flight. Ava regained her wings, and the group of birds celebrated their victory with a grand feast.",
