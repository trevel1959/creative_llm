    "In the heart of the savanna, there lived a lion named Leo, known for his majestic mane but lacking a mighty roar. While other lions thundered through the grasslands, Leo communicated with gentle purrs and soft growls. The other animals mocked him, believing a lion without a roar was no lion at all. One fateful day, a fierce drought struck, and a pack of hyenas threatened the peace. Instead of roaring, Leo used his cunning to lead the animals to a hidden waterhole. They followed him, united in their trust. In that moment, Leo realized that strength comes in many forms, and true leadership doesnâ€™t always require a roar.",
