    "**Built-in Recipe Database**: Create a sandwich toaster with a built-in touchscreen interface that features a recipe database. Users can browse through various sandwich recipes, and the toaster can automatically adjust cooking times and temperatures based on the selected recipe. This feature could also allow users to save their custom creations for future use.",
    "**Interchangeable Plates**: Design the sandwich toaster with interchangeable cooking plates that can accommodate different types of sandwiches, such as paninis, quesadillas, or even waffles. Users could easily switch out the plates depending on their meal choice, allowing for versatility and expanded cooking options.",
    "**Self-Cleaning Mechanism**: Introduce a self-cleaning feature that uses steam and heat to sanitize and clean the interior of the toaster after use. This could involve a water reservoir that, when activated, generates steam to loosen food particles, followed by a quick heating cycle to eliminate any remaining residue. A simple rinse or wipe-down would then be all that's needed.",
    "**Customizable Sandwich Size**: Implement an adjustable sandwich size feature that allows users to customize the size of their sandwiches. The toaster could have adjustable compartments that expand or contract based on the user's needs, making it suitable for everything from mini sandwiches to larger, gourmet creations.",
    "**Multi-Functionality**: Transform the sandwich toaster into a multi-functional kitchen appliance by adding features such as a grill, griddle, and even a slow cooker. This would allow users to not only make toasted sandwiches but also to prepare a variety of meals, from grilled vegetables to breakfast pancakes, all in one compact device."
