    "I would learn to generate my own electricity using alternative sources such as solar panels, wind turbines, or geothermal energy. This would require research and experimentation, but with time and effort, I could become self-sufficient in terms of power.",
    "I would rely on manual labor and traditional methods to survive. This would mean learning skills such as woodworking, farming, and hunting to provide for myself. I would also need to find ways to store food and water, as well as to purify water if necessary.",
    "I would find a community of people who are also on the same boat and form a self-sufficient society. We would work together to gather resources, build shelter, and create a sustainable way of living.",
    "I would explore my city and find hidden resources that people may have on such as generators, solar panels, or wind turbines. I would also look for underground streams or natural water sources to purify water.",
    "I would find a way to communicate with the outside world and find a way to get help. I could use my skills to build a radio or other communication device and use it to contact emergency services, friends, or family for help."
