[
    "**Increased Predation Pressure**: Larger animals would likely face more significant predation pressure, as their size makes them easier targets. This could lead to evolutionary adaptations such as faster speeds or stronger defensive mechanisms. Confidence Score: 0.9",
    "**Environmental Impact**: Larger versions of current fauna could have a profound impact on their ecosystems. For example, herbivores like elephants would consume more vegetation, potentially leading to changes in plant species composition and forest dynamics. Confidence Score: 0.85",
    "**Human Interaction**: The size increase would likely alter human-animal interactions. Larger animals might pose safety risks for humans, necessitating changes in land use and wildlife management practices. Confidence Score: 0.9",
    "**Food Web Dynamics**: In an ecosystem where animals grow to twice their size, food web dynamics would be dramatically affected. Top predators, such as lions or wolves, would need significantly more prey to sustain themselves, potentially leading to over-hunting of smaller species. Confidence Score: 0.9",
    "**Disease Spread**: Larger animals might have more contact with the ground, potentially increasing the spread of diseases from the soil to other animals. This could also affect human health through zoonotic disease transmission. Confidence Score: 0.88"
