    "Community-based Solar Power Sharing: In a world without electricity, communities can come together to create their own solar power-sharing systems. Each household can have a small solar panel on their roof, which is connected to a central hub that stores excess energy generated during the day for use at night or during periods of low sunlight. This way, the community can rely on each other for power, fostering a sense of unity and cooperation.",
    "Water-Powered Machinery: In the absence of electricity, machines can be designed to run on water power. Houses can have small water wheels or turbines that generate energy as water flows through them, providing a reliable source of power for daily tasks. This could include irrigation systems, mills for grinding grain, or even simple machines for doing laundry.",
    "Candle-Making Enterprise: Candles can be made from natural waxes like beeswax or tallow, providing a sustainable and renewable source of light. A candle-making enterprise could be established in the community, providing jobs and a reliable source of light for homes. The enterprise could also experiment with different scents and colors, creating unique and artisanal candles that are both functional and decorative.",
    "Bike-Powered Generators: Bicycles can be outfitted with generators that convert the mechanical energy of pedaling into electrical energy. This could provide a reliable source of power for homes and businesses, especially in areas with limited access to sunlight. The generators could be designed to be portable, allowing them to be easily moved between locations as needed.",
    "Night-Luminous Plant-Based Lighting: Certain plants, like certain species of mushrooms or plants, can produce bioluminescence, emitting light without the need for electricity. These plants could be cultivated and used to provide a natural source of light for homes and businesses. This could be especially useful in areas with limited access to other sources of light, providing a sustainable and renewable solution for lighting."
