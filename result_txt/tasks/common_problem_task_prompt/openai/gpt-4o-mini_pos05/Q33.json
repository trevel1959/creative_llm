    "**Food Procurement**: Finding enough food is another significant challenge. The island may have limited resources, and foraging could be risky if unfamiliar with local flora and fauna. To address this, one could create a simple fishing trap using materials found on the island, like bamboo or driftwood, to catch fish or crabs. Additionally, learning about edible plants and fruits native to the island through observation and trial could enhance food security.",
    "**Shelter Construction**: Protection from the elements is crucial for survival. Depending on the climate, a lack of shelter could lead to exposure to harsh weather conditions. A creative approach could be to construct a shelter using fallen branches and large leaves, forming a teepee structure. This design would allow for better airflow and protection from rain while utilizing natural resources effectively.",
    "**Signaling for Rescue**: If rescue is a priority, signaling for help becomes essential. However, traditional methods like smoke signals may not be effective without the right materials. A creative solution would be to create a large SOS sign using rocks or logs on the beach, which could be seen from the air. Additionally, using reflective materials like aluminum foil or shiny objects to catch the attention of passing aircraft or boats could increase the chances of being spotted.",
    "**Mental Health and Isolation**: The psychological impact of being stranded can lead to feelings of despair and loneliness. To combat this, establishing a daily routine can provide structure and purpose. Engaging in activities such as journaling about the experience, creating art from natural materials, or practicing mindfulness through meditation can help maintain mental well-being. Forming a connection with the environment, such as naming trees or animals, can also foster a sense of companionship.",
    "**Navigating the Island**: If the island is larger, getting lost can be a significant issue. To prevent this, one could create a makeshift map using natural landmarks and a compass made from a floating needle. By regularly exploring and marking paths taken with stones or sticks, one can build a mental map of the area, ensuring better navigation and reducing the risk of wandering into dangerous territory."
