Members could share their knowledge and expertise, and collaborate on new recipes and techniques for making soap using locally sourced materials.",
    "Utilize ash for cleaning: Ash from fires could be used as a natural cleaning agent. The ash can be mixed with water to create a paste that can be used to clean surfaces, removing dirt and grime without the need for commercial cleaning products. This method is especially effective for cleaning floors, walls, and other surfaces that are prone to dirt and stains.",
    "Create a water-filtering system: With the disappearance of commercial cleaning products, a water-filtering system could be developed to purify water for drinking and cleaning. This system could use natural materials like sand, gravel, and charcoal to filter out impurities and contaminants from water, making it safe for consumption and use in cleaning.",
    "Use vinegar as a cleaning agent: Vinegar is a natural acid that can be used as a cleaning agent. It can be mixed with water to create a solution that can be used to clean surfaces, remove stains, and kill bacteria and germs. Vinegar is also a natural disinfectant, making it an effective alternative to commercial cleaning products.",
    "Develop a new cleaning technology: With the disappearance of commercial cleaning products, a new cleaning technology could be developed that utilizes nanotechnology to create cleaning solutions that are more effective and efficient than traditional methods. This technology could use tiny particles to clean and disinfect surfaces, removing dirt and grime without the need for harsh chemicals or scrubbing."
