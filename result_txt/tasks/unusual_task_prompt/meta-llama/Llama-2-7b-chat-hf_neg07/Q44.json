    "Customizable Ice Cubes: Create a set of ice cube trays with interchangeable inserts, allowing users to create unique flavored ice cubes for their beverages. Each insert could be made of a different flavored gelatin or fruit juice, such as lemon, lime, or peach. This would allow users to mix and match flavors to create their ideal drink.",
    "Smart Ice Tray: Develop an ice tray with a built-in temperature sensor that can detect the temperature of the freezer and adjust the size and shape of the ice cubes accordingly. This would ensure that the ice cubes are the perfect size for any drink, and would also prevent overcrowding in the freezer.",
    "Multi-Use Ice Tray: Create an ice tray that can be used for both ice cubes and as a mold for making gelatin desserts. The tray could have a detachable bottom section that can be used as a mold for gelatin, and the ice cubes could be made by filling the top section with water and placing it in the freezer.",
    "Ice Tray with Built-In Stirrer: Design an ice tray with a small stirrer attached to the bottom of the tray. This would allow users to mix their drinks without having to use a separate stirrer, making the process more convenient and efficient.",
    "Customizable Ice Cubes with Health Benefits: Create a line of ice cubes infused with various herbs and supplements, such as vitamins, minerals, and antioxidants. These ice cubes could provide additional health benefits to the user, such as reducing inflammation or improving digestion. The ice cubes could be made using a special gelatin formula that allows the herbs and supplements to dissolve slowly in the drink, providing a consistent release of benefits over time."
