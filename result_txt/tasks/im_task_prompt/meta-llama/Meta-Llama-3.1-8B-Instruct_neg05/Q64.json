    "\"Smart Mirror\": A mirror that doubles as a smart alarm system. The mirror would have a built-in display that shows the time, weather, and news. However, it would also have a feature that uses facial recognition to detect when the user is feeling stressed or anxious. If the user is detected to be in a negative emotional state, the mirror would display a calming message or play soothing music to help the user relax. Additionally, the mirror would have a feature that tracks the user's sleep patterns and wakes them up during their lightest sleep phase, ensuring they feel rested and refreshed in the morning.",
    "\"Wake-Up Call\": A smart alarm system that uses AI to learn the user's sleep patterns and wake them up during their lightest sleep phase. However, this system would also have a twist - it would use sound waves to create a personalized wake-up call that is tailored to the user's preferences. For example, if the user loves classical music, the system would play a soothing classical piece to wake them up. If the user prefers something more energetic, the system would play an upbeat song to get them moving. The system would also have a feature that gradually increases the volume of the wake-up call over a set period of time, ensuring the user is gently awakened and not startled.",
    "\"Sleep Stage Tracker\": A smart alarm system that tracks the user's sleep stages and wakes them up during their lightest sleep phase. However, this system would also have a feature that tracks the user's sleep quality and provides personalized recommendations for improving sleep. For example, if the user is consistently waking up during the same stage of sleep, the system would suggest that they try to establish a consistent sleep schedule or avoid stimulating activities before bedtime. The system would also have a feature that allows the user to set goals for improving their sleep quality and track their progress over time.",
    "\"Mood-Boosting Alarm\": A smart alarm system that uses AI to detect the user's mood and wake them up with a personalized message or activity designed to boost their mood. For example, if the user is detected to be feeling sad or depressed, the system would play a uplifting message or suggest a fun activity to get them moving. If the user is feeling anxious or stressed, the system would play a calming message or suggest a relaxing activity to help them unwind. The system would also have a feature that allows the user to set their mood goals and track their progress over time.",
