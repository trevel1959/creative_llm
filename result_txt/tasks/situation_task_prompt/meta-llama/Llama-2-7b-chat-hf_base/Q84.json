    ". Wheelchair with a twist: You could design a wheelchair with a unique twist, such as a detachable seat that allows you to stand up and move around while still in the wheelchair. This would give you the freedom to stand up and move around while still having the support of the wheelchair when needed.",
    "Hoverchair: Imagine a hoverchair that uses magnetic levitation technology to lift you off the ground, allowing you to move around with ease. This would give you the freedom to move around without the constraints of traditional wheelchairs, and you could even use it to hover over obstacles or navigate steep inclines.",
    "Exoskeleton suit: You could design an exoskeleton suit that provides support and mobility for people who can no longer stand or walk. The suit would be lightweight and wearable, with motors and sensors that work together to help you move your limbs and maintain balance.",
    "Magnetic tracking system: Create a magnetic tracking system that allows you to move around using magnetic fields. This could involve wearing a magnetic bracelet or using a magnetic board that you can move around on, providing you with a way to navigate without having to physically move.",
    "Telepresence robot: Develop a telepresence robot that allows you to control a robotic device remotely using your thoughts. This could involve using a brain-computer interface to control the robot's movements, allowing you to move around and interact with your environment without having to physically be there."
