    "**Solar City**: Implement a city-wide solar panel installation program, providing incentives for residents to participate. Offer discounted rates for purchasing and installing solar panels, as well as rebates for excess energy produced. Partner with local businesses to create a community solar garden, where multiple residents can share the benefits of solar energy.",
    "**Solar Streets**: Develop a network of solar-powered streets, where the roads themselves are equipped with solar panels to generate electricity. This can be achieved through the use of solar road tiles or embedded solar panels in the asphalt. The generated energy can be used to power streetlights, traffic signals, and other urban infrastructure.",
    "**Community Solar Co-ops**: Establish community solar co-ops, where residents can pool their resources to purchase and maintain a shared solar array. This model allows individuals to benefit from solar energy without the upfront costs of installing individual panels. Co-ops can also provide education and support for residents to optimize their energy usage.",
    "**Solar-Powered Public Spaces**: Design public spaces, such as parks and plazas, with integrated solar panels and energy-efficient lighting. This can include solar-powered benches, bike racks, and other urban furniture. These spaces can serve as models for sustainable design and education, showcasing the benefits of solar energy in a public setting.",
    "**Solar Microgrids**: Develop microgrids that integrate solar energy with energy storage and management systems. These microgrids can provide reliable and resilient energy to specific neighborhoods or districts, reducing reliance on the grid and minimizing energy waste. They can also serve as a platform for testing and deploying new energy technologies.
