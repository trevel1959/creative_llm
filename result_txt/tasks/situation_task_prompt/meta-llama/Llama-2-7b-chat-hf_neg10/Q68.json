    "Start a time capsule: Create a box or container filled with items that represent the current state of the world, including objects, documents, and even social media profiles. Bury it in a remote location and unearth it in the future to see how things have changed.",
    "Learn a new skill or hobby: Use the abundance of time to learn something completely new and challenging, like a musical instrument, a new language, or even a new form of art. You could even create a new art form or style.",
    "Explore the world: With no one else around to worry about, you could travel to places you've always wanted to visit but never had the time. Explore remote locations, hike through untouched wilderness, or simply wander through the streets of a new city.",
    "Create a new society: With no one else around, you could create a new society with its own rules, customs, and culture. You could even create a new language or currency. The possibilities are endless!",
    "Build a utopia: Use your time to create a perfect world, free from the problems and conflicts that plague society. You could design a sustainable community with renewable energy sources, advanced technology, and a focus on well-being and happiness."
