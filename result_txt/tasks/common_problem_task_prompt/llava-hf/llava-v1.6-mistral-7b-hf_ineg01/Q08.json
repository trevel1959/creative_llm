    "Resource Availability: The lack of necessary resources, such as textbooks, workbooks, and technology platforms, could impede the implementation of the new curriculum. This might restrict the teachers' ability to teach the material properly and could negatively impact students' learning outcomes.",
    "Curriculum Alignment: Ensuring that the new curriculum is aligned with state or national standards could be challenging. If the curriculum is not aligned, students might not be adequately prepared for assessments, and the credibility of the school or district could be called into question.",
    "Parental Involvement: Limited parental involvement in the design and implementation of the new curriculum could lead to a sense of disconnect between home and school. This lack of connection might result in challenges in reinforcing the new material at home or in communication between parents and teachers.",
    "Curriculum Adaptability: The curriculum might not be flexible enough to accommodate the diverse learning needs of students. A rigid curriculum could lead to students not receiving the necessary support or accommodation, thereby affecting their academic progress.",
    "Timeline Challenges: Implementing a new curriculum on an unrealistic timeline could result in teachers feeling rushed, leading to incomplete preparation or inadequate implementation. Adequate time must be given for teachers to familiarize themselves with the new material and to develop lesson plans that effectively teach the new curriculum."
