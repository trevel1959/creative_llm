    "**Plot Holes and Inconsistencies**: As the screenplay progresses, it’s easy to introduce plot holes or inconsistencies that can confuse viewers. For example, if a character’s actions contradict their established personality or the rules of the film’s universe, it can break immersion. To prevent this, the writer should outline the plot thoroughly and keep a detailed timeline of events and character arcs, ensuring everything aligns logically before finalizing the script.",
    "**Pacing Issues**: A screenplay can suffer from poor pacing, where certain scenes drag on while others feel rushed. This can lead to audience disengagement. To tackle this, the writer should carefully plan the structure of the screenplay, balancing action, dialogue, and exposition. Incorporating feedback from trusted readers can help identify areas where the pacing feels off, allowing for revisions that enhance the overall flow of the narrative.",
    "**Dialogue Dilemmas**: Writing authentic and engaging dialogue can be challenging, especially when trying to convey character personalities and advance the plot simultaneously. If dialogue feels forced or unrealistic, it can detract from the film's impact. To overcome this, the writer should focus on \"showing\" rather than \"telling\" through subtext and body language. Additionally, reading dialogue aloud can help identify awkward phrasing and improve naturalness.",
    "**Theme Ambiguity**: A screenplay may struggle to convey its central theme clearly, leading to confusion about the story's message. If the theme is ambiguous, viewers may leave with different interpretations, which can dilute the film's impact. To address this, the writer should define the theme early in the writing process and ensure that all plot points and character arcs support this central idea, weaving it seamlessly into the narrative.",
    "**Budget Constraints**: When writing a screenplay, it’s important to consider the practical aspects of production, such as budget constraints. Certain scenes or special effects may be too costly to produce, which can lead to significant changes in the script. To mitigate this issue, the writer should think creatively about how to convey action or emotion without relying on expensive visuals, using dialogue, character interactions, or clever settings to create impactful moments."
