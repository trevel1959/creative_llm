    "**Eco-Plex**: A futuristic, self-sustaining habitat that combines cutting-edge technology with natural elements. The Eco-Plex would be a dome-shaped structure with a transparent, energy-harvesting skin that collects and stores solar energy. The interior would feature a lush, tropical rainforest ecosystem, complete with towering trees, winding rivers, and diverse wildlife. The habitat would be designed to mimic the natural cycles of the rainforest, with a focus on conservation and education.",
    "**Aquaria**: An underwater habitat that allows visitors to explore the world's oceans in a safe and immersive environment. Aquaria would be a massive, cylindrical structure with a transparent, pressure-resistant shell that descends into the depths of the ocean. The interior would feature a network of tunnels and chambers, providing a unique perspective on marine life and ecosystems. Visitors would be able to interact with marine animals, learn about conservation efforts, and participate in scientific research.",
    "**Aerthys**: A futuristic, aerodynamic habitat that combines sustainable design with thrilling experiences. Aerthys would be a sleek, wing-shaped structure that hovers above the ground, supported by a network of wind turbines and solar panels. The interior would feature a series of interconnected modules, each offering a unique experience, such as a high-speed wind tunnel, a zero-gravity simulation chamber, or a virtual reality adventure zone. Visitors would be able to explore the intersection of technology and nature.",
    "**Terraverde**: A sprawling, interconnected habitat that celebrates the diversity of the world's ecosystems. Terraverde would be a large, irregularly shaped structure that incorporates a variety of natural environments, from deserts to rainforests, and from coral reefs to Arctic tundras. The interior would feature a series of interconnected modules, each designed to replicate a specific ecosystem, complete with native plants, animals, and microclimates. Visitors would be able to explore the complexities and wonders of the natural world.",
    "**Nexarion**: A hybrid habitat that combines elements of nature and technology to create a unique, adaptive environment. Nexarion would be a modular, shape-shifting structure that can be reconfigured to respond to changing environmental conditions. The interior would feature a dynamic, living system that incorporates bioluminescent organisms, algae, and other microorganisms to create a glowing, ethereal atmosphere. Visitors would be able to interact with the habitat, influencing its shape and behavior through a range of sensors and interfaces. [/INST] Assistant:"
