    "Utilize the island's natural resources: Create a sustainable shelter using materials found on the island such as palm fronds, vines, and rocks. Use the island's freshwater sources to purify water and create a desalination system for drinking and irrigation. Hunt for wild animals or fish to supplement your diet, and forage for fruits and vegetables to ensure a balanced meal.",
    "Build a signal fire: Create a large fire on a hill or cliff to create a visible signal to passing aircraft or boats. Use a mirror or reflective material to reflect sunlight towards the fire during the day to increase visibility. Use the fire to communicate with any potential rescuers and provide them with information about your location and situation.",
    "Create a solar-powered water purification system: Design and build a solar-powered water purification system using materials found on the island. This system can use the sun's energy to purify seawater or contaminated water, making it safe for drinking. This can be achieved through a process called photocatalysis, where the sun's UV rays are used to break down impurities in the water.",
    "Create a composting toilet: Use the island's natural vegetation to create a composting toilet. This can be done by digging a hole and covering it with a layer of vegetation, such as leaves or coconut husks. As the vegetation breaks down, it will create a natural compost that can be used as fertilizer for plants. This will not only provide a sanitary solution for waste disposal but also help to restore the island's ecosystem.",
    "Build a raft: Use the island's resources to build a raft that can be used to escape the island. Gather driftwood, vines, and other flotation devices to create a sturdy raft. Use the island's natural resources to create a sail or oars to propel the raft through the water. This can be a time-consuming process, but it can provide a means of escape in case of emergency or if you are stranded on the island for an extended period of time."
