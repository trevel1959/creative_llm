    "**Self-Cleaning Hairbrush**: Design a hairbrush that features a built-in cleaning mechanism. After brushing, the user can press a button that activates a small motor to remove hair strands from the bristles. This could involve retractable bristles or a rotating mechanism that pushes the hair out, making maintenance easier and ensuring the brush stays hygienic.",
    "**Customizable Brush Head**: Introduce a hairbrush with interchangeable brush heads that cater to different hair types and styles. Users could easily switch between a wide-tooth comb for detangling, a paddle brush for smoothing, or a round brush for styling. This would make the hairbrush versatile and suitable for various hair needs.",
    "**Ergonomic and Eco-Friendly Design**: Develop a hairbrush that is ergonomically designed for comfort, featuring a handle that molds to the user's grip. Additionally, use sustainable materials like bamboo or recycled plastics to create the brush, appealing to environmentally conscious consumers. This would not only enhance user experience but also promote sustainability.",
    "**Heat-Activated Styling Hairbrush**: Create a hairbrush that incorporates heat technology, allowing users to style their hair while brushing. The brush could have adjustable temperature settings and use ceramic or tourmaline bristles to distribute heat evenly, helping to smooth and curl hair without needing a separate styling tool.",
    "**Hairbrush with Built-in Hair Product Dispenser**: Innovate a hairbrush that includes a compartment for hair products such as detanglers, conditioners, or styling sprays. The user can dispense a small amount of product while brushing, ensuring even application and reducing the need for additional steps in their hair care routine."
