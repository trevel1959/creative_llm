    "**Eco-Friendly Sunglasses with Solar Charging**: Develop sunglasses made from sustainable materials, such as recycled plastics or bamboo, that also feature solar panels on the arms. These panels could charge small electronic devices like smartphones or earbuds while you're on the go. This not only promotes environmental responsibility but also adds convenience for users who are often outdoors.",
    "**Customizable Lens Color and Design**: Introduce a line of sunglasses with interchangeable lenses that allow users to customize the color and design based on their mood or outfit. These lenses could also have various functionalities, such as polarization for driving, blue light blocking for screen use, or even photochromic lenses that adjust to changing light conditions. Users could easily swap out lenses, creating a personal accessory that reflects their unique style.",
    "**Built-in Health Monitoring**: Design sunglasses equipped with sensors that can monitor health metrics like UV exposure, heart rate, and even hydration levels. The sunglasses could sync with a smartphone app to provide real-time feedback and tips for staying healthy while enjoying outdoor activities. For example, if the UV index is high, the app could remind the user to apply sunscreen or take a break in the shade.",
    "**Noise-Canceling Sunglasses**: Combine the functionality of sunglasses with noise-canceling technology. These sunglasses could feature built-in microphones and speakers that detect ambient noise and cancel it out, allowing users to enjoy music or podcasts without disturbing the surrounding environment. This would be particularly beneficial for commuters or those in busy urban areas who want to maintain their focus while enjoying the outdoors.",
    "**Foldable and Portable Design**: Create a pair of sunglasses that can fold into a compact shape, making them easy to carry in pockets or small bags. This design could include flexible materials that allow the frames to bend without breaking. Additionally, the folding mechanism could be enhanced with a magnetic closure, ensuring they stay securely closed when not in use. This would cater to travelers and active individuals who need space-saving solutions."
