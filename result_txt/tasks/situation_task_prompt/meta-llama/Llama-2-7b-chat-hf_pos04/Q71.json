    "Build a Raised Bed: Create a raised bed garden by stacking wooden planks or using concrete blocks to elevate the soil above the hard ground. This will allow you to dig into the soil without worrying about hitting hard ground. You can also add a layer of organic matter such as compost or well-rotted manure to improve soil fertility and drainage.",
    "Use a Tunnel Greenhouse: Create a tunnel greenhouse using a plastic or polycarbonate sheeting. This will allow you to plant your garden undercover, protected from the hard ground. You can place the tunnel over a raised bed or directly on the hard ground, and add a layer of soil and plants inside.",
    "Plant in Pots: Use large pots or containers to plant your garden. This will allow you to dig into the soil in the pot without worrying about hitting hard ground. You can also use pots with good drainage holes to prevent waterlogged soil.",
    "Grow Hydroponically: Hydroponics is a method of growing plants in water rather than soil. This can be a good option if the ground is too hard to dig into, as you can place the plants in a container filled with water and nutrients. This method can also be used indoors, providing a way to grow plants year-round.",
    "Create a Geodesic Dome Greenhouse: Build a geodesic dome greenhouse using a frame of wood or PVC pipes covered with plastic or polycarbonate sheeting. This will provide a large, enclosed space for planting a garden without the need for digging into the hard ground. You can also add a layer of soil and plants inside the dome for a more traditional gardening experience."
