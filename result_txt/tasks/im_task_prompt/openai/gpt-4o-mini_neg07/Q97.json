    "**Self-Retracting Leash with Tension Control**: Create a self-retracting dog leash that automatically adjusts its length based on the dog's behavior. If the dog pulls too hard, the leash could tighten slightly to discourage pulling, while still allowing the owner to maintain control. This could be achieved through a tension control mechanism that senses the dog's movement and adjusts accordingly.",
    "**Multi-Functional Leash with Built-in Storage**: Design a leash that includes compartments for storing essentials like dog treats, waste bags, and a collapsible water bowl. This would allow dog owners to carry everything they need for a walk without needing an additional bag, making outings more convenient and organized.",
    "**Interactive Leash with LED Lights and Sounds**: Innovate a leash that incorporates LED lights and sound features for evening walks. The lights could change colors based on the dogâ€™s activity (e.g., red for stop, green for go), and sound alerts could notify the owner of nearby hazards or distractions, such as other animals or people. This would enhance safety during nighttime walks.",
    "**Adjustable Length Leash with Smart Sensors**: Introduce a leash that can be adjusted in length automatically based on the dog's behavior and environment. Equipped with smart sensors, the leash could shorten when approaching traffic or other dogs, and extend in open areas. This would help maintain control while allowing the dog to explore safely.",
    "**Comfort Grip Handle with Vibration Feedback**: Develop a leash with a handle designed for comfort, featuring vibration feedback technology. This could alert the owner when the dog is pulling too hard or when the dog has reached the end of the leash. The handle could be ergonomically designed to reduce strain on the wrist, making walks more enjoyable for both the owner and the dog."
