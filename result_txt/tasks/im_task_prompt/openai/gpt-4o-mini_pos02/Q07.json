    "**Eco-Friendly Biodegradable Toothbrush**:    Create a toothbrush made entirely from biodegradable materials, such as bamboo or plant-based plastics. This toothbrush could feature replaceable heads to reduce waste further. Additionally, the packaging could be compostable, and the product could come with a recycling program to encourage users to return their old toothbrushes for proper disposal.",
    "**Toothbrush with Built-in Water Flosser**:    Innovate a toothbrush that incorporates a mini water flosser. This dual-action tool would allow users to brush and floss simultaneously, enhancing oral hygiene. The toothbrush could have a small water reservoir and a button to release a fine mist of water while brushing, effectively cleaning between teeth and along the gum line.",
    "**UV-C Sanitizing Toothbrush Holder**:    Design a toothbrush holder that uses UV-C light technology to sanitize toothbrushes after each use. The holder could have a timer that activates the UV-C light for a specific duration, killing bacteria and viruses on the brush head. This feature would ensure that users maintain a hygienic toothbrush, reducing the risk of oral infections.",
    "**Interactive Toothbrush for Kids**:    Create an interactive toothbrush specifically designed for children, featuring colorful lights, sounds, and a built-in timer that rewards them for brushing for the recommended two minutes. The toothbrush could connect to a game app that encourages kids to brush by unlocking new levels or rewards based on their brushing habits, making oral care fun and engaging.",
    "**Adjustable Bristle Firmness Toothbrush**:    Develop a toothbrush with adjustable bristle firmness. Users could twist a dial or press a button to change the bristle stiffness based on their preference or dental needs (e.g., sensitive gums or plaque removal). This customizable feature would cater to various users and promote better brushing experiences."
