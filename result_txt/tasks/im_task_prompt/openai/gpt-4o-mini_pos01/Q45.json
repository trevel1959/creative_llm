    "**Color-Changing LED Blades**: Design ceiling fan blades that can change color based on the mood or time of day. Using RGB LED technology, the blades could shift colors to create ambiance. For instance, they could emit a soft blue light during the evening to promote relaxation or a bright yellow during the day to energize the space. This feature could be controlled via a mobile app or voice commands.",
    "**Air Quality Monitoring**: Incorporate air quality sensors into the ceiling fan to detect pollutants, dust, and allergens in the air. The fan could then adjust its speed or activate a built-in air purification system when poor air quality is detected. This would not only enhance comfort but also promote healthier indoor air quality.",
    "**Personalized Wind Zones**: Create a ceiling fan with adjustable blades that can be positioned to create personalized wind zones. Users could adjust the angle and height of the blades through a mobile app or remote control to direct airflow to specific areas of the room. This would allow for customized comfort levels in shared spaces, accommodating different preferences.",
    "**Eco-Friendly Materials and Energy Generation**: Use sustainable materials for the fanâ€™s construction, such as bamboo or recycled plastics. Additionally, integrate small solar panels on the fan's housing to generate energy from sunlight, reducing reliance on electricity. This eco-friendly approach would appeal to environmentally conscious consumers and promote energy efficiency.",
    "**Integrated Sound System**: Design a ceiling fan that features an integrated Bluetooth sound system. Users could connect their devices to the fan and enjoy music or ambient sounds while the fan operates. This could be particularly appealing for relaxation or entertainment purposes, creating a multi-functional fixture that enhances the room's atmosphere."
