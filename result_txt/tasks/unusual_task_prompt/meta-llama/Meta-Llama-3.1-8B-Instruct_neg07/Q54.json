    "**Smartwatch with Augmented Reality (AR) Display**: Design a wristwatch with a flexible, high-resolution display that overlays digital information onto the real world using AR technology. Users can view virtual objects, such as digital clocks, maps, or even 3D models, superimposed onto their surroundings. This watch would utilize a combination of cameras, sensors, and machine learning algorithms to track the user's environment and provide personalized, interactive experiences.",
    "**Biometric Feedback Wristwatch with Haptic Feedback**: Create a wristwatch that not only tracks vital signs like heart rate, blood pressure, and oxygen levels but also provides real-time feedback to the user through subtle vibrations and temperature changes. This watch would use advanced sensors and algorithms to detect anomalies in the user's biometric data, alerting them to potential health issues before they become severe.",
    "**Wristwatch with Integrated Micro-Projector**: Develop a wristwatch that features a tiny, high-brightness micro-projector capable of projecting images, videos, or data onto any surface. This watch would be perfect for presentations, business meetings, or even outdoor adventures, allowing users to share information or entertainment with others without needing a separate device.",
    "**Wristwatch with Built-in Air Quality Sensor**: Design a wristwatch that includes a high-precision air quality sensor, tracking pollutants like particulate matter, ozone, and nitrogen dioxide. This watch would provide users with real-time information about their surroundings, alerting them to potential health risks and suggesting ways to improve indoor and outdoor air quality.",
    "**Wristwatch with Integrated Gesture Recognition**: Create a wristwatch that uses advanced computer vision and machine learning algorithms to recognize and interpret hand gestures, allowing users to control their devices or interact with virtual objects without needing to physically touch a screen. This watch would be perfect for people with disabilities or those who prefer a more intuitive way of interacting with technology. [/INST] "
