    "Satellite Phones: One option for contacting someone in another country without electronic communication would be to use satellite phones. These phones use a satellite connection to make and receive calls, so they would not be affected by a shutdown of electronic communication. Satellite phones are already used in remote areas where traditional communication networks are not available, and they could be a reliable means of communication in the event of a global outage.",
    "Carrier Pigeons: Another option for contacting someone in another country would be to use carrier pigeons. These birds can be trained to carry small messages, and they can fly long distances without the need for electronic communication. While this method may be slower than modern electronic communication, it could be a reliable way to send messages over long distances in the event of a global outage.",
    "Optical Messages: Another option for contacting someone in another country would be to use optical messages. This could involve using mirrors or other reflective surfaces to send messages through the use of reflected light. For example, a message could be written on a piece of paper and then reflected off a mirror to be seen by someone else at a distance. This method would be slow and may not be reliable, but it could be a way to send messages in the event of a global outage.",
    "Homing Pigeons: Another option for contacting someone in another country would be to use homing pigeons. These birds are trained to find their way back to their home location, and they could be used to carry messages over long distances. Homing pigeons are already used in some parts of the world for messaging, and they could be a reliable means of communication in the event of a global outage.",
    "Reliable Local Networks: Another option for contacting someone in another country would be to rely on local networks that are not dependent on global communication systems. For example, local radio stations could be used to broadcast messages, or local newspapers could be used to convey information. These local networks could be a reliable means of communication in the event of a global outage, as they are not dependent on global systems that could be affected."
