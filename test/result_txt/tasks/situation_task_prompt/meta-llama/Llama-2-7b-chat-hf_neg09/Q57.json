    "Floating Cities: In a scenario where ocean levels rise drastically, one possible solution could be to build floating cities. These cities would be designed to house people and provide all the necessary amenities while being suspended above the water. The floating cities could be made up of interconnected platforms or islands, each one providing a unique living space. The structures could be designed to withstand harsh weather conditions and could be equipped with sustainable energy sources, such as solar panels or wind turbines.",
    "Submerged Arcology: Another option could be to build submerged arcologies, which are structures that combine architecture and ecology. These structures would be designed to blend seamlessly into the ocean environment and provide a self-sustaining ecosystem. The submerged arcologies could be built with materials that are resistant to corrosion and could be equipped with advanced water filtration systems. The interior of the structures could be designed to mimic the natural environment, providing a habitat for marine life.",
    "Water-Based Transportation: To adapt to the rising ocean levels, people could use water-based transportation systems to move around. This could include advanced boats, ships, and submarines that are designed to navigate through the changing ocean conditions. The transportation systems could be powered by sustainable energy sources, such as solar panels or wind turbines, and could be equipped with advanced navigation systems.",
    "Ocean-Friendly Building Materials: Another creative solution could be to use ocean-friendly building materials that are resistant to corrosion and can withstand the harsh conditions of the ocean environment. These materials could include materials such as coral-based concrete, which is made from a mixture of coral and cement, and seaweed-based insulation, which is made from the natural insulating properties of seaweed. These materials could be used to build structures that are not only durable but also environmentally friendly.",
    "Artificial Islands: Finally, a creative solution could be to create artificial islands in the ocean. These islands could be designed to provide a safe haven for people who are displaced by the rising ocean levels. The islands could be built using advanced 3D printing technology and could be equipped with sustainable energy sources,"
