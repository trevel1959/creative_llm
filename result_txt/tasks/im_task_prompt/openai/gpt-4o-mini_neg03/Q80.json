    "**Whisk with Adjustable Speed and Rotation Modes**: Imagine a whisk that allows users to select different speeds and rotation modes for various tasks. For instance, it could have a slow stir mode for delicate mixtures, a fast whip mode for egg whites, and a turbo mode for heavy dough. This feature would be especially beneficial for home bakers who want precision in their mixing without manually adjusting their technique.",
    "**Self-Cleaning Whisk**: This innovative whisk could feature a self-cleaning mechanism using ultrasonic waves to remove food residue. After use, the whisk could be placed in a special cleaning chamber that utilizes water and ultrasonic technology to dislodge and eliminate any remnants, making cleanup effortless and ensuring the whisk remains hygienic.",
    "**Whisk with Interchangeable Heads**: This concept would involve a whisk with interchangeable heads that can be swapped out depending on the task. For example, users could choose from a balloon whisk for whipping, a flat whisk for sauces, or a spiral whisk for dough. This versatility would allow for more efficient cooking without cluttering the kitchen with multiple utensils.",
    "**Ergonomically Designed Whisk with Adaptive Grip**: A whisk that features an ergonomic handle with adaptive grip technology could mold to the user's hand shape, providing comfort and reducing strain during prolonged use. This could be especially useful for individuals with arthritis or limited hand strength, allowing everyone to enjoy cooking without discomfort.",
    "**Whisk with Built-in Scale**: This whisk could integrate a digital scale into the handle, allowing users to measure ingredients directly as they whisk. The scale could display weight measurements on a small screen, making it easier to add ingredients incrementally without needing a separate measuring tool. This would streamline the cooking process and improve accuracy in recipes."
