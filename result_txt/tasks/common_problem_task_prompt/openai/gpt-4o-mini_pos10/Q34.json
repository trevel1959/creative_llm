    "**Programming and Control Issues**: The robot's functionality heavily relies on its programming. If the algorithms for movement, decision-making, or interaction are not well-developed, the robot may perform poorly or behave unpredictably. Rigorous testing and iterative programming, along with machine learning techniques, can enhance its capabilities and adaptability.",
    "**Power Supply Limitations**: Ensuring that the robot has a reliable and sufficient power supply is crucial. Problems can arise from battery life, charging efficiency, and heat management. Exploring advanced battery technologies, such as solid-state batteries or solar power integration, can mitigate these issues and improve operational longevity.",
    "**Safety Concerns**: Robots interacting with humans or operating in dynamic environments can pose safety risks. Issues may arise from mechanical failures, unintentional collisions, or software bugs. Implementing robust safety protocols, including emergency stop functions, physical barriers, and extensive safety testing, can help ensure safe operation.",
    "**User Interface and Experience**: If the robot is intended for public use, a poorly designed user interface can lead to confusion or frustration among users. This can be addressed by focusing on user-centered design principles, conducting usability testing, and providing clear instructions or tutorials to enhance the user experience.",
    "**Environmental Adaptability**: Robots may struggle to operate effectively in varying environmental conditions, such as extreme temperatures, humidity, or terrain. This could limit their application in real-world scenarios. Developing adaptable materials and robust environmental sensors can improve the robot's resilience and functionality across different settings."
