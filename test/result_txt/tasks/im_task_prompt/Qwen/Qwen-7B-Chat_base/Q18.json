    "Eco-Friendly Car Wash: Create a car wash that uses environmentally friendly products and methods to clean cars. This could include using biodegradable soap, recycled water, and solar-powered equipment. The wash could also offer customers the option of donating their清洗费 to environmental causes.",
    "Car Subscription Service: Offer customers the option to rent a car for a monthly fee instead of purchasing one outright. This would allow customers to have access to a variety of different vehicles without having to worry about maintenance or repairs. The subscription service could also offer additional benefits such as insurance coverage and roadside assistance.",
    "Autonomous Car Rental: Partner with companies that are developing autonomous vehicle technology to offer rental services to customers. This would allow customers to experience the future of transportation without having to purchase a self-driving car themselves. The rental service could also be offered in cities where autonomous driving is becoming more prevalent.",
    "Car Sharing Platform: Create a platform that connects people who need a car with those who own one but don't use it all the time. This would allow car owners to earn extra money by renting out their vehicle when they're not using it, while also providing an affordable transportation option for people who can't afford a car of their own.",
    "Electric Car Charging Station Network: Develop a network of charging stations for electric cars throughout the city. This would make it easier for people to own and operate electric cars, which are becoming increasingly popular due to their low emissions and cost savings over traditional gasoline-powered vehicles. The charging station network could also include features such as real-time availability information and mobile payment options."
