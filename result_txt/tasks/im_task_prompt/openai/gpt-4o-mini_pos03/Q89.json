    "**Smart Temperature Control**: Integrate a smart temperature control system that uses sensors to automatically adjust cooking times and temperatures based on the batter type (e.g., gluten-free, vegan, or traditional). Users could connect the waffle iron to a smartphone app, which would allow them to choose from a library of recipes, receive notifications when the waffles are ready, and even track nutritional information.",
    "**Built-in Flavor Infuser**: Create a waffle iron with a built-in flavor infuser that allows users to add different flavors to their batter while cooking. Users could add extracts, spices, or even fruit purees through a designated compartment. This would enable the creation of unique waffle flavors like cinnamon roll, chocolate chip, or even savory options like herb-infused waffles.",
    "**Self-Cleaning Feature**: Develop a waffle iron with a self-cleaning mechanism that uses steam or a special coating to prevent batter from sticking. After cooking, users could simply activate the self-cleaning function, which would release steam to loosen any residue and make it easier to wipe down. This would significantly reduce the hassle of cleaning up after breakfast.",
    "**Integrated Topping Dispenser**: Add an integrated topping dispenser that allows users to automatically dispense toppings like syrup, whipped cream, or fruit directly onto the waffles as they cook. The dispenser could be controlled by a simple dial or app, allowing for perfect portioning and customization without the need for extra dishes.",
    "**Waffle Iron with Built-in Recipe Book**: Incorporate a digital display on the waffle iron that features a built-in recipe book. Users could browse through a variety of recipes, select their desired waffle style, and the iron would automatically adjust the cooking time and temperature accordingly. This feature would be especially helpful for novice cooks looking to experiment with different recipes."
