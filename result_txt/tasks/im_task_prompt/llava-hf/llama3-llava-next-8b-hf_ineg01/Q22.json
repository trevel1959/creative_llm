    "**Battery Indicator**: Add a low battery indicator that alerts users when the flashlight's batteries are running low. This can be a visual or auditory signal that prompts the user to replace the batteries before the light fails.",
    "**Multi-Mode Operation**: Create a multi-mode flashlight that allows users to switch between different modes such as high, low, strobe, and SOS. This would be particularly useful for emergency situations where a user might need to signal for help or conserve battery life.",
    "**Red Light Mode**: Include a red light mode that preserves night vision by not completely blinding the user in a dark environment. This would be especially useful for activities like camping, where users might need to navigate through the dark without disturbing their night vision.",
    "**Solar Charging**: Add solar charging capabilities to the flashlight, allowing users to recharge the batteries by placing the flashlight in direct sunlight. This feature would be particularly useful in outdoor settings where traditional power sources are unavailable.",
    "**Rear Light**: Introduce a rear light feature that illuminates the user's surroundings from behind, allowing them to see where they are going without having to look down at the flashlight. This would be particularly useful for activities like hiking or biking, where visibility is crucial."
