    "Virtual try-on feature: Develop a smart glasses app that allows users to virtually try on different frames without physically trying them on. This feature could be achieved through augmented reality (AR) technology, using a smartphone camera and a 3D scanner to capture the user's face shape and facial features. This would save time and effort for customers who are unsure of what frame style suits them best.",
    "Smart glasses with built-in hearing aids: Create a pair of glasses with built-in hearing aids for individuals with hearing impairments. These glasses could have small speakers or microphones embedded in the frame, which could amplify sounds or transmit them directly to the user's hearing aids. This would provide a convenient and discreet solution for individuals who struggle with hearing in noisy environments.",
    "Augmented reality display: Develop a pair of glasses with an augmented reality (AR) display that overlays digital information onto the wearer's field of vision. This could be useful for a variety of applications, such as viewing virtual instructions for a DIY project, or seeing a virtual map of a new city while walking. The AR display could use a see-through LCD or OLED display technology, allowing the wearer to see both the digital information and the real world simultaneously.",
    "Smart glasses for athletes: Create a pair of glasses specifically designed for athletes, with features such as a heart rate monitor, GPS tracking, and performance analysis. The glasses could use a combination of sensors and machine learning algorithms to track the wearer's performance in real-time, providing feedback on areas for improvement. This could be useful for athletes looking to optimize their training and improve their performance.",
    "Personalized lens technology: Develop a pair of glasses with personalized lens technology that adjusts the lens density and tint based on the wearer's surroundings. For example, the lenses could darken in bright light or lighten in low light, providing optimal vision in any environment. This technology could also be used to create prescription lenses that adapt to the wearer's specific vision needs, such as a pair of glasses that automatically adjusts the lens power based on the wearer's age or the amount of time spent on digital devices."
