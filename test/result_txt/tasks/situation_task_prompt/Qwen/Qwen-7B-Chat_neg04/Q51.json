    "Build a raft out of materials found in nature such as logs, branches, and leaves. Use vines or ropes to tie the raft together and create a sturdy structure. Test the raft in a calm body of water before attempting to cross the river.",
    "Create a makeshift bridge using fallen trees or large rocks. Clear away any debris from the riverbed and use these materials to create a sturdy footpath across the river. Be sure to test the stability of the bridge before crossing it.",
    "If there are no natural resources available, consider building a human-powered raft using bicycles or kayaks. Attach the bikes or kayaks to long poles and use them to propel the raft across the river.",
    "Use a zip line to cross the river. Set up a cable between two points on either side of the river and attach a pulley system to a tree or other stable object. Use a harness and safety equipment to rappel down the cable and cross the river.",
    "If none of the above options are feasible, consider swimming across the river. If the water is not too deep or fast-moving, this can be a safe option. However, make sure to swim with a partner and have a plan in case of an emergency."
