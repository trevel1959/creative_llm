Additionally, teachers can use technology to track each student's progress and provide personalized feedback.",
    "Project-Based Learning: Incorporate project-based learning into the curriculum where students work on real-world problems and challenges. This approach encourages critical thinking, creativity, and collaboration among students. Students can work in groups or individually to complete projects that align with the curriculum objectives.",
