    "Build a Sun-Harvesting Dome: Create a large, translucent dome that covers a specific area, allowing sunlight to pass through during the day. The dome would be designed with special materials that can harness and store solar energy, providing a consistent source of light and power. Confidence Score: 0.8",
    "Solar Panel Window Film: Develop a special window film that can absorb and convert sunlight into electricity, even on cloudy days. This film could be applied to windows in buildings, providing a sustainable and efficient source of energy. Confidence Score: 0.9",
    "Cloud-Busting Drones: Develop small, unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) that can break up clouds and create gaps in the coverage, allowing sunlight to reach the ground. These drones could be equipped with specialized tools, such as water cannons or ice bombs, to help disperse the clouds. Confidence Score: 0.7",
    "Sunlight-Harvesting Trees: Genetically engineer trees to have a higher concentration of chlorophyll, allowing them to absorb more sunlight and convert it into energy. These trees could be planted in strategic locations to provide a reliable source of sunlight, even on cloudy days. Confidence Score: 0.8",
    "Cloud-Based Solar Panels: Develop solar panels that can be installed on clouds themselves, allowing them to absorb sunlight from above and below. These panels could be designed to be lightweight and buoyant, making them easy to deploy and maintain in the sky. Confidence Score: 0.9"
