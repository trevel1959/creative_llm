    "**Biological Rhythms**: People could rely on their natural circadian rhythms to estimate time. By paying attention to their body's internal clock, which regulates sleep-wake cycles, hunger, and other bodily functions, individuals could roughly estimate the time of day. For example, feeling hungry might signal that it's lunchtime, while feeling tired might indicate that it's approaching bedtime.",
    "**Astronomical Observations**: People could use the position of the sun, moon, and stars to estimate time. By observing the sun's path across the sky, individuals could determine the time of day, while noting the phases of the moon and the position of constellations could help them estimate the time of year. This method would require a basic understanding of astronomy and the ability to navigate using celestial bodies.",
    "**Natural Phenomena**: People could use natural events like sunrise, sunset, and the tides to estimate time. By observing the timing of these events, individuals could create a rough schedule for their daily activities. For example, knowing when the tide comes in and goes out could help someone plan their beach activities or fishing trips.",
    "**Food Preparation and Consumption**: People could use the preparation and consumption of food to keep track of time. By preparing meals at regular intervals, individuals could estimate the time of day based on the cooking time and the time it takes to eat. This method would require a basic understanding of cooking times and the ability to plan meals accordingly.",
    "**Music and Sound**: People could use music and sound to keep track of time. By creating a series of musical compositions or sound patterns that correspond to specific times of the day, individuals could create a sort of \"sound clock\" that helps them estimate the time. For example, a specific melody could signal the start of the workday, while a different melody could indicate the end of the workday. This method would require a basic understanding of music and the ability to create and recognize specific sound patterns."
