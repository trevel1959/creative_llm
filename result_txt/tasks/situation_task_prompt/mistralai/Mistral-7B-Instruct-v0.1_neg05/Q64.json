    "Use memory-enhancing techniques: If all photos and paintings disappeared, we would have to rely on our memory to recall past events and people. We could use memory-enhancing techniques such as association, visualization, and mnemonics to help us remember more effectively. For example, we could associate a specific smell, taste, or sound with a particular memory to help us recall it later.",
    "Keep written records: We could keep written records of our experiences, such as journals or diaries, to help us remember past events and people. These records could include descriptions of people, places, and events, as well as any emotions or feelings associated with them.",
    "Create mental images: We could create mental images of people and events to help us remember them. For example, we could imagine a person's face or body in detail, or picture a particular scene from an event. These mental images could help us recall the person or event more easily.",
    "Seek out other sources of information: If all photos and paintings disappeared, we could seek out other sources of information to help us remember past events and people. This could include talking to people who were there, reading books or articles about the event, or watching documentaries or videos.",
    "Use technology to our advantage: While photos and paintings may have disappeared, technology can still be a useful tool for remembering. We could use apps or software to help us remember people and events, such as creating digital scrapbooks or using note-taking apps. These tools could help us organize and store information in a way that is easy to access and recall later."
