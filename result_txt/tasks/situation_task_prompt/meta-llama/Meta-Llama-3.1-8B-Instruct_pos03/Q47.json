    "**Solar Umbrella Helmet**: Design a helmet with a built-in, retractable umbrella that deploys automatically when the sun reaches a certain intensity. The umbrella would be made of a lightweight, water-resistant material and have a UV-blocking coating to protect the scalp from the sun's rays.",
    "**Hair Replacement Skin**: Develop a synthetic skin substitute that can be applied directly to the scalp, providing a smooth, hair-free surface. This skin substitute would be breathable, waterproof, and have built-in UV protection, ensuring the scalp remains safe from the sun.",
    "**Sun-Blocking Headband**: Create a wearable headband with integrated, adjustable UV-blocking panels. These panels would be made of a flexible, lightweight material and could be easily removed and washed when needed. The headband would also feature a built-in cooling system to keep the scalp comfortable.",
    "**Reflective Scalp Shield**: Design a lightweight, portable shield that can be placed on the scalp to deflect UV rays. The shield would be made of a reflective material, such as aluminum or Mylar, and have a flexible design to conform to the shape of the head.",
    "**Nano-Particle Sunscreen**: Develop a topical sunscreen that uses nano-particles to create a physical barrier against UV radiation. This sunscreen would be applied directly to the scalp, providing long-lasting protection and allowing for easy reapplication as needed."
