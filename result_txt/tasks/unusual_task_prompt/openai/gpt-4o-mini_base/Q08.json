    "**Plant Cozy**: Use a colorful sock as a decorative plant cozy. Simply cut the sock to fit around the base of a small potted plant, giving it a fun and unique look while also helping to retain moisture in the soil. This can add a pop of color to your home decor while providing some insulation for the roots.",
    "**Sock Puppet Theater**: Transform an old sock into a puppet for storytelling or educational purposes. You can draw or glue on facial features, add yarn for hair, and use it as a fun tool to engage children in reading or learning activities. This can also be a great way to teach kids about emotions and social interactions.",
    "**Dusting Mitt**: Slip a clean sock over your hand and use it as a dusting mitt. The fabric will easily attract dust and dirt from surfaces like shelves, blinds, and electronics.
