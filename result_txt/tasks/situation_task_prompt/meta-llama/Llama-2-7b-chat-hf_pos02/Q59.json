    "Sun-Powered Umbrellas: Develop umbrellas with built-in solar panels that can harness and store sunlight during the day, providing a reliable source of light even when the sky is cloudy. These umbrellas could be equipped with LED lights or OLED displays to provide additional illumination.",
    "Cloud-Based Lighting: Create a network of cloud-based lighting systems that can be activated and deactivated remotely. These systems could use nanotechnology to convert water droplets in the clouds into light-emitting particles, providing a soft, diffuse light even when the sky is overcast.",
    "Mirrored Architecture: Design buildings and structures with highly reflective surfaces that can reflect sunlight from nearby sources, even when the sky is cloudy. This could involve using mirrored glass, aluminum, or other materials to maximize the amount of sunlight that reaches the interior of buildings.",
    "Solar-Powered Rain: Develop technology that can harness the energy of rainwater and convert it into electricity. This could involve using photovoltaic cells or other solar-powered devices to capture the energy from raindrops and convert it into usable power.",
    "Cloud-Based Energy Storage: Create a network of cloud-based energy storage systems that can store excess energy generated from solar or wind power during sunny or windy periods, and release it during periods of cloudiness. This could involve using advanced battery technology or other energy storage methods to store the energy in the clouds themselves, making it available when needed."
