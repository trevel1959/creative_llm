    "Increase access to laser eye surgery: With the disappearance of glasses and contact lenses, there would be a greater demand for laser eye surgery as a permanent solution for vision correction. This could lead to more affordable and widely available options for people with poor vision.",
    "Develop advanced corneal implants: Corneal implants could be a viable option for people with severe vision impairments. Scientists could work on developing more advanced implants that could be inserted into the cornea and provide better vision than traditional contact lenses.",
    "Encourage natural vision correction methods: With the absence of corrective lenses, people would have to rely on their natural vision correction methods, such as wearing glasses or contacts. This could lead to a greater focus on developing natural vision correction methods, such as LASIK, PRK, and photorefractive keratectomy.",
    "Emphasize prevention and early detection of vision problems: Without the availability of corrective lenses, people would need to take extra precautions to prevent vision problems from developing in the first place. This could lead to a greater emphasis on prevention and early detection of vision problems, such as regular eye exams and screenings.",
    "Develop advanced technology for vision correction: With the disappearance of corrective lenses, there would be a greater focus on developing advanced technology for vision correction, such as retinal implants, optogenetics, and other forms of electrical stimulation."
