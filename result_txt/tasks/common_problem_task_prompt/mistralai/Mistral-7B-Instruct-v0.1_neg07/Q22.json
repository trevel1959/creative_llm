    "The \"Morse Code\" Plan: This idea involves building a massive, global Morse code installation that would be visible from outer space. By using the well-known and widely recognized Morse code as a universal language, we could potentially communicate with any alien life that may be out there. This plan could be a collaborative effort between countries and would require a significant amount of resources and time, but the potential payoff of making first contact with another form of life would be immense.",
    "The \"Sigigig\" Plan: This idea involves building a large, interconnected network of telescopes that would be capable of scanning the universe for signs of life. By using a combination of cutting-edge technology and traditional telescope designs, we could potentially detect signals from alien civilizations and respond in real-time. This plan would require a significant amount of funding and resources, but it could lead to groundbreaking discoveries about the nature of the universe and our place in it.",
