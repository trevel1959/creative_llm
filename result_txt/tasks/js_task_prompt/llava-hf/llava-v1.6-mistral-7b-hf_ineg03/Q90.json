    "**Improved Vision**: I would enhance human vision to include better depth perception, increased field of view, and the ability to see a wider range of the electromagnetic spectrum, such as infrared and ultraviolet light. This could lead to better navigation, early detection of certain diseases, and a more immersive experience in photography and other visual arts.",
    "**Enhanced Immune System**: I would strengthen the human immune system to make it more robust and efficient at detecting and eliminating pathogens. This could potentially reduce the severity and duration of illnesses and diseases.",
    "**More Efficient Digestive System**: I would redesign the digestive system to be more efficient at breaking down food and extracting nutrients. This could lead to improved energy levels, better weight management, and potentially reduce the risk of gastrointestinal disorders.",
    "**Regenerative Capabilities**: I would introduce regenerative capabilities that allow for the repair and regeneration of damaged tissues and organs. This could potentially extend lifespan and improve overall health.",
    "**Energy Efficiency**: I would design the human body to be more energy-efficient. This could include improving the efficiency of the cardiovascular system, optimizing metabolism, and enhancing the body's ability to store and utilize energy. This could lead to increased stamina, better concentration, and potentially reduce the risk of obesity and related health issues."
