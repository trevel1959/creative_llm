    "**Modular Design**: Create a modular coat rack that allows users to customize its shape and size according to their space. The components could include interchangeable hooks, shelves, and even small storage compartments. Users could rearrange or add parts as needed, making it adaptable for various environments, from small apartments to larger homes.",
    "**Integrated Lighting**: Incorporate LED lighting into the coat rack that activates when a coat is hung or removed. This feature would provide illumination in dark entryways and add a stylish touch. The lights could be color-adjustable, allowing users to change the ambiance according to their mood or season.",
    "**Sustainable Materials**: Design a coat rack using eco-friendly and sustainable materials, such as bamboo or recycled plastics. This approach not only appeals to environmentally conscious consumers but also offers a unique aesthetic. The rack could also be marketed with a “tree planting” initiative, where a tree is planted for every rack sold.",
    "**Personalized Hooks**: Offer customizable hooks that can be personalized with names, initials, or designs. This would add a personal touch and make the coat rack a unique piece of home decor. Users could select from various colors, materials, and styles to match their interior design.",
    "**Multi-Functional Features**: Transform the coat rack into a multi-functional piece of furniture by adding a built-in bench or a small shoe storage compartment at the bottom. This would provide a convenient place to sit while putting on or taking off shoes and offer additional storage for shoes or bags, maximizing utility in small spaces."
