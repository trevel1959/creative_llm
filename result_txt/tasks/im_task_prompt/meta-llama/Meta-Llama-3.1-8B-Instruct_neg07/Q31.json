    "Create a camera that can capture the world in 360 degrees, with a rotating lens that can move freely in any direction. This camera would be equipped with advanced stabilization technology to ensure smooth and shake-free footage. The camera could be mounted on a drone or a wearable device, allowing users to capture immersive and interactive videos.",
    "Develop a camera that can capture images and videos in multiple formats, such as 2D, 3D, and holographic. This camera would use advanced sensors and algorithms to detect the environment and adjust the camera settings accordingly. The camera could also be equipped with a built-in editor that allows users to edit and enhance their footage in real-time.",
    "Design a camera that can capture images and videos in complete darkness, using advanced sensors and algorithms to detect even the smallest amounts of light. This camera would be ideal for applications such as surveillance, astronomy, or wildlife photography.",
    "Create a camera that can capture images and videos in slow motion, but with a twist: the camera would use advanced AI algorithms to analyze the footage and automatically add visual effects, such as slow-motion replays, fast-motion sequences, and even green screen effects.",
    "Develop a camera that can capture images and videos in multiple locations at the same time, using advanced sensors and algorithms to stitch together multiple images and videos into a single, seamless video. This camera would be ideal for applications such as surveillance, event coverage, or real estate marketing."
