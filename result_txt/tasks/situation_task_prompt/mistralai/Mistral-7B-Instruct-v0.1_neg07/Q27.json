    "Open: If is a technology that uses blockchain to create a decentralized network of nodes. These nodes use natural heat sources like to regulate temperature. By connecting multiple nodes together, they can create a network that can maintain a stable temperature in a space.",
    "Solar: Solar bump is a technology that uses solar panels to generate energy. This energy can then be used to power a pump that circulates water through a network of pipelines. The water absorbs heat from the environment and then releases it into the space, regulating the temperature.",
    "Thermal bump: Thermal bump is a technology that uses thermal energy to regulate temperature. It uses a material that has a high thermal conductivity and low thermal mass to transfer heat from one place to another. By placing thermal bump in strategic locations around a space, it can be used to regulate temperature.",
    "Magnetic bump: Magnetic bump is a technology that uses magnetic fields to regulate temperature. It uses a material that has a high magnetic permeability to create a magnetic field that can be used to transfer heat from one place to another. By placing magnetic bump in strategic locations around a space, it can be used to regulate temperature.",
    "Bacterial bump: Bacterial bump is a technology that uses bacteria to regulate temperature. It uses a strain of bacteria that can convert organic matter into heat. By placing bacterial bump in strategic locations around a space, it can be used to regulate temperature."
