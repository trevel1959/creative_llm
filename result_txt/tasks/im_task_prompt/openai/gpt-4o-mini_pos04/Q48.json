    "**Augmented Reality (AR) Learning Experience**: Develop an AR system that projects visual aids onto the piano keys, such as light indicators for notes or chords. This system could also provide interactive tutorials and practice exercises, helping players learn songs more effectively. By using a smartphone or AR glasses, users could see which keys to press in real-time, making the learning process more engaging and fun.",
    "**Multi-Sensory Feedback System**: Incorporate a multi-sensory feedback system into the piano that uses vibrations, lights, and sounds to enhance the playing experience. For example, the piano could vibrate at different frequencies depending on the intensity of the notes played, and lights could change color based on the dynamics of the music. This would provide a more immersive experience, making it appealing for performances and practice sessions.",
    "**Customizable Key Pressure Sensitivity**: Create a piano with adjustable key pressure sensitivity settings, allowing players to customize how much force is required to produce different volumes. This feature would cater to different playing styles and preferences, enabling players to fine-tune their touch and control over dynamics, which could be particularly beneficial for both classical and contemporary music styles.",
    "**Portable and Modular Piano Design**: Design a portable, modular piano that can be easily assembled and disassembled for travel. Each module could represent a different section of the piano (e.g., keyboard, pedals, sound module), allowing musicians to customize their setup based on their needs. This would be ideal for traveling musicians, educators, or those with limited space, making it easier to practice and perform anywhere.",
    "**Integrated Music Composition Software**: Equip the piano with built-in music composition software that allows players to record their performances, layer tracks, and arrange music without needing a computer. The software could feature a user-friendly interface with touchscreen controls, enabling musicians to experiment with different sounds and arrangements directly from the piano. This would streamline the creative process and encourage more spontaneous composition."
