    "**Expandable and Modular Design**: Create a suitcase that can expand or contract based on the traveler's needs. The suitcase could feature zippered sections that allow for additional space when needed, such as for souvenirs or extra clothing. Additionally, a modular design could allow travelers to attach or detach smaller compartments for specific items, like a shoe compartment or a tech pouch.",
    "**Built-in Charging Station**: Equip the suitcase with solar panels or a built-in power bank that allows travelers to charge their devices on the go. This would be particularly useful during long layovers or when traveling to remote areas where charging options are limited. The suitcase could feature multiple USB ports for charging multiple devices simultaneously.",
    "**Personalized Locking System**: Introduce a suitcase with a biometric locking system that recognizes the owner's fingerprint or facial features. This would enhance security and eliminate the need for keys or combinations. Additionally, travelers could set up a temporary access code for trusted friends or family members, allowing them to unlock the suitcase when needed.",
    "**Integrated Scale and Weight Management**: Add a built-in digital scale to the suitcase that displays the weight of the luggage as it is packed. This feature would help travelers avoid overweight baggage fees and ensure they are within airline limits. The suitcase could also suggest packing tips based on weight limits, helping travelers pack more efficiently.",
    "**Eco-Friendly Materials and Design**: Focus on sustainability by using eco-friendly materials for the suitcase, such as recycled plastics or biodegradable fabrics. Additionally, the suitcase could feature a design that minimizes waste during production. An eco-friendly suitcase could appeal to environmentally conscious travelers and promote a more sustainable travel culture."
