    "**Augmented Reality Overlay**: Create an augmented reality (AR) feature that allows users to visualize different photography settings in real-time through their camera. This could include showing the effect of different lenses, filters, and even simulated lighting conditions. Users could see how their photos would look with various adjustments before taking the shot, making it easier to experiment creatively.",
    "**Customizable Lens Filters**: Design a set of modular lens filters that can be easily attached or detached from the camera. These filters could be adjustable in terms of opacity, color, and texture, allowing photographers to create unique effects on the fly. For example, a photographer could slide a filter over the lens to create a vintage look or add a gradient effect to the sky in landscape photography.",
    "**Voice-Controlled Photography**: Introduce a voice-controlled camera assistant that allows users to take photos, adjust settings, and even edit images hands-free. This feature would be particularly useful for solo photographers who want to capture themselves without needing to set a timer or ask someone else for help. The assistant could respond to commands like “take a portrait” or “zoom in on the subject.”",
    "**Interactive Photography Tutorials**: Incorporate an interactive tutorial feature within the camera or app that provides step-by-step guidance for various photography techniques. Users could select a topic (like long exposure or macro photography) and follow along with prompts and tips that appear on their screen, making learning more engaging and practical.",
    "**Mood-Based Photography Modes**: Create a camera mode that adjusts settings based on the user’s mood, which could be determined through a simple questionnaire or even biometric feedback (like heart rate). For example, if a user feels adventurous, the camera might switch to a high-action mode with faster shutter speeds and dynamic settings, encouraging them to capture spontaneous moments."
