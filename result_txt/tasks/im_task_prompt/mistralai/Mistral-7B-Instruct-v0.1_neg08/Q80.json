Remember that everyone has their own unique strengths and weaknesses, and just because someone finished a task easily doesn't mean they didn't put in the effort or work hard. Instead of comparing yourself to others, focus on your own progress and growth, and celebrate your accomplishments no matter how small they may be.\"",
    "\"One way to overcome jealousy is to focus on gratitude. Instead of comparing yourself to others, try to appreciate the things you have in your life and the progress you have made.

    "\"Another way to overcome jealousy is to seek out feedback and guidance. Instead of comparing yourself to others, seek out constructive criticism and advice from those around you.
