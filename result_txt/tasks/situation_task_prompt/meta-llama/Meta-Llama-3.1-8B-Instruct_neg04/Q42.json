    "**Utilizing Natural Resources**: I would start by assessing the island's environment, looking for potential sources of food, water, and shelter. I would identify the types of plants and trees that grow on the island, and learn which ones are edible and safe to consume. I would also search for freshwater sources, such as rivers, streams, or ponds, and find ways to purify the water to make it drinkable. To build a shelter, I would gather materials like palm fronds, branches, and leaves, and construct a sturdy hut or lean-to structure.",
    "**Signaling for Help**: To increase my chances of being rescued, I would create a signal fire or a smoke signal during the day to alert potential rescuers. I would also gather materials to create a makeshift flag or sign, using brightly colored materials like leaves, flowers, or shells, to draw attention to my location. Additionally, I would use my surroundings to create a signal, such as arranging rocks or palm fronds in a specific pattern.",
    "**Fishing and Hunting**: To supplement my diet, I would learn how to catch fish and other seafood using makeshift fishing gear, such as a spear or a net made from island materials. I would also try to hunt small game like birds, crabs, or other small animals, using tools like a makeshift bow and arrow or a spear. I would make sure to follow sustainable hunting practices to avoid depleting the island's resources.",
    "**Water Collection and Purification**: To ensure a steady supply of clean drinking water, I would collect rainwater or use a natural water source like a spring. I would also learn how to purify water using methods like boiling, sand filtration, or using plant-based water purification techniques. To make the process more efficient, I would create a simple water collection system using materials like leaves, rocks, or shells.",
    "**Island Exploration and Mapping**: To better understand the island's layout and potential resources, I would explore the island thoroughly, mapping out its terrain, water sources, and potential hazards. I would also keep track of the island's tides, weather patterns, and any notable features like caves or rocky outcroppings. This knowledge would help me navigate the island safely and make informed decisions about where to focus my survival efforts."
