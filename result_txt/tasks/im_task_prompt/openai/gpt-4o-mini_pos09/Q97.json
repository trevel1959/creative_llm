    "**Adjustable Length Leash**: Create a leash that can be adjusted in length with a simple mechanism. This could involve a retractable design or a sliding clip that allows the owner to easily change the leash length based on the environment. A shorter length would be ideal for busy streets, while a longer length would be perfect for open parks, giving dogs more freedom to roam while still being controlled.",
    "**Multi-Function Leash with Built-in Waste Bag Dispenser**: Design a leash that incorporates a waste bag dispenser and a small storage compartment for treats or keys. This all-in-one solution would eliminate the need for pet owners to carry extra bags or items, making walks more convenient. The dispenser could be designed to hold eco-friendly bags, promoting responsible pet ownership.",
    "**Reflective and Illuminated Leash**: Introduce a leash made from reflective materials or equipped with LED lights for nighttime visibility. This would enhance safety during evening walks, making both the dog and owner more visible to drivers and cyclists. The illumination could be activated by a simple button or automatically when it gets dark, ensuring that walks are safe regardless of the time of day.",
    "**Comfort Grip Leash with Ergonomic Design**: Create a leash with an ergonomic handle designed for comfort during long walks. The handle could be made from soft, non-slip materials and shaped to fit the natural grip of the hand, reducing strain and fatigue. Additionally, the leash could have a padded section that allows for a second handhold, providing better control during training or when managing multiple dogs.",
    "**Training Leash with Integrated Clicker**: Develop a leash that features a built-in clicker for training purposes. This would allow pet owners to reward their dogs instantly while on the go, reinforcing positive behavior without needing to carry additional tools. The clicker could be ergonomically placed on the handle, making it easy to use with one hand, thus enhancing the training experience during walks."
