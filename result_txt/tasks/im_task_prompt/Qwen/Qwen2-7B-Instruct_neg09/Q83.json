    "**Personalized Shopping Cart Notifications:** Implement a feature where the shopping cart automatically sends notifications to the user's preferred devices (like their phone or email) as they add items to the cart. These notifications could include personalized offers based on their past purchase history, recommendations for related products, or reminders about items that were recently in stock but are now sold out.",
    "**Interactive Product Comparison:** Allow users to compare multiple items in their cart directly from the cart page. This could include visual aids like side-by-side product images, price comparisons, customer reviews, and ratings. This would help users make informed decisions without needing to leave the cart page, streamlining the purchasing process.",
    "**Dynamic Pricing Based on Cart Contents:** Introduce a system where the total cost of items in the cart changes based on the number of items or specific combinations of items added. For example, discounts might apply when a certain number of similar items are added, or a free item might be offered after reaching a certain total value in the cart.",
    "**Smart Suggestive Selling:** Use machine learning algorithms to predict what other items customers might want to buy based on their current selections. For instance, if someone adds a laptop to their cart, the cart could suggest accessories like a carrying case, screen protector, or additional storage solutions. This could increase the average order value and improve customer satisfaction.",
    "**Collaborative Cart Recommendations:** Implement a feature where users can invite friends or family members to view and contribute to their shared shopping cart. This could enhance the shopping experience by allowing group discussions and decision-making processes, particularly useful for gifts or large purchases. Users could also earn rewards or discounts for successful recommendations or referrals."
