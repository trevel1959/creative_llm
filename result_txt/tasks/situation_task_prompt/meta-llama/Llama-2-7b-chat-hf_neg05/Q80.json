    "Virtual Wallets: In a world without paper money or coins, people could use virtual wallets to store and transfer value. These digital wallets could be linked to bank accounts or cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin, allowing for easy and secure transactions.",
    "Bartering Systems: With the absence of physical currency, people could resort to bartering systems to exchange goods and services. For instance, a farmer could exchange fresh produce for a haircut or a mechanic could exchange car repairs for a night's stay at a hotel.",
    "Contactless Payments: In a cashless society, contactless payment methods like Apple Pay or Google Wallet could become the norm. People could simply tap their smartphones or wearable devices to make payments, eliminating the need for physical currency.",
    "Digital Currencies: In the absence of traditional currency, new digital currencies could emerge to fill the void. These currencies could be decentralized, meaning they're not controlled by any government or financial institution, and could offer greater security and privacy for transactions.",
    "Smart Contracts: Another option would be to use smart contracts, which are self-executing contracts with the terms of the agreement written directly into code. These contracts could be used to facilitate transactions and ensure that both parties fulfill their obligations, eliminating the need for intermediaries like banks or payment processors."
