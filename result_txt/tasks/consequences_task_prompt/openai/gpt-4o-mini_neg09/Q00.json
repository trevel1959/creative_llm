This could lead to a society where emotional intelligence declines, as individuals may become less empathetic and more self-centered, focused on their own mental exhaustion and frustrations.",
    "**Workplace Revolution**: The traditional workday might undergo a dramatic transformation. With no need for sleep, the concept of a 9-to-5 job could vanish, leading to a 24/7 work culture. While some may thrive in this environment, others could feel pressured to work continuously, resulting in burnout and a decline in productivity. Companies may need to implement new structures to manage this constant workflow, potentially leading to a rise in flexible job roles and remote work.",

Without sleep, people could face a higher risk of chronic illnesses, such as heart disease and diabetes, as the body struggles to recover and maintain balance. This could place an immense burden on healthcare systems, as more individuals seek treatment for conditions that arise from a lack of restorative sleep.",

    "**Evolution of Entertainment**: With the elimination of sleep, people might seek new forms of entertainment to fill the time that would have been spent resting.
