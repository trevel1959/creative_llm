    "Use natural ingredients: If all cooking equipment disappeared, we would have to rely on natural ingredients to prepare a meal. We could use fire to roast or grill meat, fish or vegetables. We could also use a sharp stick to chop vegetables or fruits. For cooking, we could use clay pots or stones to heat water and cook grains or legumes.",
    "Forage for food: We could forage for wild edible plants, such as berries, nuts, and herbs, to make a meal. We could also hunt or fish for food, depending on our location.",
    "Make a fire: If all cooking equipment disappeared, we would need to make a fire to cook our food. We could use dry leaves, twigs, or grass to start a fire, and then use it to roast or grill our food.",
    "Use simple tools: We could use simple tools, such as a rock or stick, to chop or crush food. We could also use a sharp stone or knife to cut meat or vegetables.",
    "Make a salad: If all cooking equipment disappeared, we could still make a salad. We could chop vegetables and mix them with oil, vinegar, or lemon juice to make a dressing. We could also add nuts, seeds, or dried fruits for flavor and nutrition."
