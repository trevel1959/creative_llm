    "**Budget Constraints**: Budgeting for an art exhibition can be challenging. There may be unexpected costs associated with venue rental, insurance, promotional materials, and catering. If the budget is not carefully managed, it could lead to overspending, forcing the organizers to cut corners or compromise on essential aspects of the exhibition.",
    "**Artist Coordination and Communication**: Coordinating with multiple artists can lead to miscommunication regarding timelines, artwork specifications, and installation requirements. If artists are not on the same page, it could result in delays, incomplete installations, or artwork that doesn’t align with the exhibition’s theme.",
    "**Marketing and Promotion Challenges**: Effectively marketing the exhibition is crucial for attracting visitors. However, if the marketing strategy is poorly executed or if there’s a lack of funds for promotional activities, the exhibition may not receive the attention it deserves. This can lead to lower attendance rates and a lack of engagement with the art community.",
    "**Installation Issues**: The installation process can be fraught with challenges, such as damage to artwork during setup, inadequate tools or manpower, or miscalculations regarding space. If installations are not handled professionally, it can affect the overall presentation of the exhibition and the safety of the artworks.",
    "**Engagement and Interaction**: Ensuring that visitors are engaged and have an interactive experience can be difficult. If the exhibition lacks engaging elements, such as guided tours, artist talks, or interactive installations, it may fail to leave a lasting impression on visitors. This could result in a lack of interest in future exhibitions or events."
