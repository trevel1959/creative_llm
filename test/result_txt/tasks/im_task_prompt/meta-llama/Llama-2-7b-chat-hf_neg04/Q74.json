    "Smart Watering Can: Create a watering can that can detect the soil moisture levels and automatically adjust the water flow accordingly. This can help prevent overwatering or underwatering, resulting in healthier plants.",
    "Multi-Purpose Watering Can: Design a watering can with interchangeable attachments, such as a small funnel for delicate plants, a spray nozzle for hard-to-reach areas, or a long, thin tube for watering plants on a high shelf.",
    "Self-Watering Planter: Create a planter that can collect and store water for its own plants. This can be achieved through a built-in water reservoir or a water-absorbing material that slowly releases water as needed.",
    "Sensory Watering Can: Design a watering can with different textures and colors to stimulate the senses of plants. For example, a can with a rough, bumpy surface to stimulate the roots, a smooth surface to help with photosynthesis, and a colorful design to attract beneficial insects.",
    "Watering Can with Built-in Fertilizer: Develop a watering can that can dispense fertilizer along with water, providing a concentrated dose of nutrients to plants. This can help promote healthy growth and reduce the need for separate fertilizer applications."
