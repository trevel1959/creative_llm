    "**Radiation Exposure**: Mars offers little to no protection against cosmic radiation, which can be detrimental to both human health and electronic equipment. This could lead to increased cancer risks, damage to critical systems, and even the degradation of living quarters.",
    "**Atmospheric Pressure**: The Martian atmosphere is too thin to support liquid water, which is essential for human survival. This means that any water used for drinking, hygiene, or agriculture must be recycled or transported from Earth, adding to the mission's logistical challenges.",
    "**Food Production**: Growing food on Mars is a significant challenge due to the harsh environment and lack of resources. This could lead to food shortages, malnutrition, and decreased crew morale.",
    "**Communication Breakdowns**: The distance between Mars and Earth means that communication with Earth is delayed by up to 20 minutes each way. This could lead to misunderstandings, miscommunications, and critical decisions being made without the necessary input from Earth.",
    "**Isolation and Confined Spaces**: Living in a Martian habitat for an extended period can lead to psychological effects such as isolation, claustrophobia, and cabin fever. This could impact the crew's mental health and overall performance."
