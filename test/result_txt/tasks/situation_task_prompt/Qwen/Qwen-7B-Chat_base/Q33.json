    "Use natural phenomena such as the sun, moon, and stars to determine the time of day. For example, the position of the sun in the sky at different times throughout the day can be used to mark the hours. Additionally, the phases of the moon can be used to determine the date.",
    "Create a system using sounds or vibrations to mark the passing of time. For instance, a bell could be rung every hour or a drum beaten every quarter-hour to indicate the passage of time.",
    "Develop a method for measuring the length of time it takes for certain physical events to occur, such as the growth of plants or the movement of water through pipes. This could be done by using specialized instruments or tools.",
    "Use ancient methods of keeping time, such as the abacus or sundials, which were developed before the invention of clocks and watches. These methods may not be as accurate as modern timekeeping devices, but they can still provide a basic understanding of the passage of time.",
    "Utilize technology to create a new type of clock or watch that doesn't rely on traditional mechanisms. For example, a clock could use radio waves to transmit the current time to a receiver, or a watch could use a built-in GPS system to determine its location and adjust for local time zones."
