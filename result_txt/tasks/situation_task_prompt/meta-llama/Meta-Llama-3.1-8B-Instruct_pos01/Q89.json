    "**Bio-based bioplastics**: Develop a new generation of bioplastics derived from renewable biomass sources, such as corn starch, sugarcane, or potato starch. These bioplastics would be biodegradable, compostable, and non-toxic, reducing the environmental impact of plastic waste.",
    "**Mushroom-based materials**: Leverage mycelium, the vegetative part of a mushroom, to create sustainable materials for packaging, textiles, and other applications. Mycelium-based materials are biodegradable, compostable, and can be engineered to have unique properties, such as insulation or water resistance.",
    "**Seaweed-based composites**: Utilize seaweed, a rapidly renewable resource, to create sustainable composites for packaging, construction, and other industries. Seaweed-based composites could replace traditional plastics, offering biodegradability, non-toxicity, and unique mechanical properties.",
    "**Graphene-based materials**: Develop innovative materials incorporating graphene, a highly conductive and strong nanomaterial, to create sustainable alternatives to plastics. Graphene-based materials could be used for packaging, electronics, and other applications, offering improved performance and reduced environmental impact.",
    "**Algae-based bioplastics**: Engineer algae-based bioplastics that can be produced using wastewater treatment processes, reducing the need for freshwater resources. These bioplastics would be biodegradable, compostable, and non-toxic, offering a sustainable solution for packaging and other applications."
