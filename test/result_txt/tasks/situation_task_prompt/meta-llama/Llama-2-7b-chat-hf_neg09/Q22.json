    "Personal Air Transportation Devices: With all roads disappearing, individuals could create personal air transportation devices, such as jetpacks or hoverboards, to navigate their surroundings. These devices could be powered by electricity or other sustainable energy sources, ensuring a safe and eco-friendly mode of transportation.",
    "Underground Tunnels and Subway Systems: Building extensive underground tunnels and subway systems could provide an alternative means of transportation. These tunnels could be designed to connect different areas of the town or city, allowing people to easily travel without relying on roads.",
    "Waterways and Ferries: If all roads disappeared, waterways such as rivers, lakes, and coastal areas could become the primary means of transportation. Ferries and boats could be used to transport people and goods across these waterways, connecting different parts of the town or city.",
    "Bicycle-Powered Transportation: With roads disappearing, bicycles could become a more prominent mode of transportation. People could use bicycles to travel short distances, and longer distances could be covered using bicycle-powered vehicles, such as recumbent bicycles or bicycle-powered tricycles.",
    "Maglev Transportation: With the absence of roads, magnetic levitation (Maglev) transportation could become a viable option. Maglev trains could be built to transport people and goods at high speeds, minimizing the need for roads and providing a smooth and efficient mode of transportation."
