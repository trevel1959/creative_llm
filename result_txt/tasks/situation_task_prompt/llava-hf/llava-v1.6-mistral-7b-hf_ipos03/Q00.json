    "**Public Transportation**: Public transportation systems like buses, trains, and trams would become the primary mode of transportation. However, since cars are not functioning, these systems might become overcrowded and less reliable, leading to longer travel times and delays.",
    "**Bicycles and Electric Scooters**: Bicycles and electric scooters could become more popular, as they would be a convenient and eco-friendly alternative to cars. They would require proper infrastructure and designated lanes to ensure safety and efficient travel.",
    "**Hyperloop Transportation**: Hyperloop transportation systems, if available, would provide a fast and efficient means of travel between cities. These systems use electric propulsion to travel at high speeds, which would be particularly useful in a world without functioning cars.",
    "**Aerial Transportation**: In some cities, aerial transportation systems like helicopters or drones could become more common. These systems would provide a quicker and more direct route between cities, bypassing traffic and congestion.",
    "**Pedestrian Networks**: In some urban areas, pedestrian networks such as skywalks and underground tunnels could become more prevalent. These networks would allow people to travel between cities without being exposed to outdoor conditions or needing to rely on public transportation."
