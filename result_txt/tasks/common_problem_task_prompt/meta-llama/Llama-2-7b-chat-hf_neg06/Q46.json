    "Floating Bus Stops: Create floating bus stops that can move along with the bus, providing a more comfortable and convenient experience for passengers. These stops would be equipped with digital displays, Wi-Fi, and charging stations for passengers' devices. This innovative solution would reduce the need for passengers to stand in crowded bus lanes and improve the overall passenger experience.",
    "AI-Powered Bus Routes: Implement an AI-powered bus route optimization system that can adjust bus routes in real-time based on traffic patterns, road closures, and other factors. This system would reduce travel time and improve on-time performance, while also reducing fuel consumption and emissions.",
    "Virtual Bus Stations: Create virtual bus stations that allow passengers to plan their route, track their bus in real-time, and receive notifications when their bus is approaching. This system would be especially useful for passengers who are unfamiliar with the city or for those who need to transfer between different bus routes.",
    "Smart Bus Shelters: Design smart bus shelters that provide real-time information on bus arrival times, weather forecasts, and local news. These shelters would also include charging stations, Wi-Fi, and digital displays that can showcase local advertisements or art installations. This innovative solution would enhance the overall passenger experience and make the city more livable.",
    "Autonomous Bus Network: Introduce an autonomous bus network that can operate without a human driver. This network would be powered by a combination of AI, sensors, and GPS technology, ensuring a safe and efficient transportation system. Autonomous buses would reduce the need for human labor, lower operating costs, and improve safety on the roads."
