    "**Adaptive Tinting**: Develop glasses with lenses that automatically adjust their tint based on the intensity of sunlight. Using photochromic technology, these lenses could darken in bright conditions and return to a clear state indoors. This would enhance comfort for users, reducing glare and eye strain without the need for separate sunglasses.",
    "**Personalized Frame Fit**: Create a 3D scanning app that allows users to scan their face and get custom-fitted frames. The app could analyze facial dimensions and suggest frame styles that complement the userâ€™s features. This would not only improve comfort but also enhance aesthetic appeal by providing a truly personalized accessory.",
    "**Built-in Health Monitoring**: Incorporate sensors into the glasses that monitor eye health and overall wellness. These sensors could track metrics like blink rate, eye strain, and UV exposure, providing users with insights through a connected app. This feature would promote eye care awareness and encourage users to take breaks when necessary.",
    "**Interchangeable Style Elements**: Design glasses with interchangeable parts, such as temple arms and front frames, allowing users to customize their look easily. This could be achieved with a simple snap-on mechanism, enabling users to switch styles based on their mood, outfit, or occasion without needing multiple pairs of glasses.",
    "**Sound-Integrated Lenses**: Create glasses with built-in bone conduction speakers that allow users to listen to music or take phone calls without the need for traditional earbuds. This technology would keep the ears open to ambient sounds, making it safer for outdoor activities while providing a seamless audio experience."
