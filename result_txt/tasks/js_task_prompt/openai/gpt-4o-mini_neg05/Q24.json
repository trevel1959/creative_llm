    "**Smart Mobility Hubs**: Instead of traditional parking lots, the city would feature smart mobility hubs that integrate various forms of transportation, including electric buses, bikes, scooters, and autonomous vehicles. Each hub would have real-time data displays, allowing residents to choose the most efficient mode of transport. This would minimize traffic congestion and promote eco-friendly commuting options. Additionally, a network of pedestrian-friendly pathways would connect these hubs, encouraging walking and cycling.",
    "**Energy-Positive Buildings**: All buildings in the city would be designed to be energy-positive, generating more energy than they consume. This could be achieved through solar panels, wind turbines, and advanced energy storage systems. Buildings would also utilize smart technology to optimize energy usage, adjusting heating, cooling, and lighting based on occupancy and weather conditions. This would not only reduce the city's carbon footprint but also lower energy costs for residents.",
    "**Cultural Exchange Zones**: To foster community and inclusivity, the city would feature designated cultural exchange zones where residents from diverse backgrounds can share their traditions, food, and art. These zones would host regular festivals, workshops, and performances, encouraging collaboration and understanding among different cultures. This vibrant cultural tapestry would enhance the city’s identity and strengthen community bonds.",
    "**Waste-to-Resource Facilities**: The city would implement a zero-waste philosophy, featuring waste-to-resource facilities that convert organic waste into compost and energy. These facilities would educate residents about recycling and composting, encouraging them to minimize waste. Additionally, an innovative app would allow residents to track their waste production and receive rewards for reducing waste, promoting sustainable habits throughout the community.",
    "**Adaptive Reuse Districts**: In a bid to preserve history while promoting innovation, the city would have adaptive reuse districts where old industrial buildings are transformed into modern spaces for living, working, and creativity. Artists’ studios, co-working spaces, and community centers would thrive in these repurposed structures, maintaining the city’s heritage while providing affordable options for residents and entrepreneurs. This would foster a sense of place and continuity."
