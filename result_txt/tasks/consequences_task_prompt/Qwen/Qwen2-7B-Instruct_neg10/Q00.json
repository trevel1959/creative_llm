    "**Social Changes**: The loss of sleep could lead to dramatic social changes. Traditional schedules like school, work, and family routines would become obsolete. Social norms would need to adapt, perhaps leading to a more fluid and flexible way of organizing daily life. For instance, instead of fixed meeting times, interactions might occur spontaneously throughout the day.",
    "**Health Paradox**: While one might assume that not needing sleep would lead to healthier individuals, the lack of sleep could have unforeseen health consequences. For example, metabolism could become disrupted, leading to weight gain or metabolic disorders. Additionally, the body's natural detoxification processes might not function optimally without sleep, affecting overall health.",
    "**Psychological Impact**: Humans rely on sleep for emotional regulation and mental health. Without it, individuals might experience heightened anxiety, depression, or even psychosis. There could be a need for new forms of therapy and support systems designed specifically for those who no longer need sleep.",
    "**Impact on Education**: Schools and universities would need to restructure their curricula and teaching methods significantly. Learning might become more continuous rather than segmented by days. New technologies and teaching techniques would likely emerge to accommodate this change, focusing on long-term retention and continuous learning.",
    "**Environmental Changes**: With humans working continuously, there could be a greater strain on resources and infrastructure. This might necessitate new approaches to urban planning, energy usage, and resource management. For example, cities might evolve to better support round-the-clock activity, with different zoning laws and public services adapted for a non-stop society."
