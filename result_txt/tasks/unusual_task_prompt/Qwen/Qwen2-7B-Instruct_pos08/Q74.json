    "**Innovative Vehicle Training Program**: Develop a comprehensive program that uses virtual reality (VR) technology to simulate real-world driving scenarios. Participants can practice steering through challenging situations like heavy traffic, bad weather conditions, or sharp turns without the risks associated with actual driving. This not only enhances their skills but also builds confidence in handling unexpected situations on the road.",
    "**Steering Wheel Fitness Challenge**: Create a gamified fitness challenge where participants use a specially designed steering wheel to perform exercises targeting strength, flexibility, and coordination. The steering wheel could incorporate sensors to track performance metrics such as grip strength, range of motion, and speed, turning physical activity into an engaging and measurable experience.",
    "**Smart Steering Wheel for Autonomous Vehicles**: Design a steering wheel that transforms into an interactive control center for semi-autonomous vehicles. It would feature touch-sensitive controls, haptic feedback, and voice recognition to guide passengers through the process of taking over manual control when necessary. This would ensure passenger safety while providing them with hands-on experience and understanding of how autonomous systems operate.",
    "**Steering Wheel as a Learning Tool for Robotics**: Utilize a steering wheel as a teaching aid in robotics education. Students can learn about principles of movement, force, and control by programming the steering wheel to navigate simple robotic vehicles or drones. This practical approach helps bridge the gap between theoretical knowledge and real-world application.",
    "**Steering Wheel as a Therapeutic Tool**: Adapt a steering wheel into a rehabilitation tool for individuals recovering from injuries or neurological disorders that affect motor skills. By incorporating adaptive features such as adjustable resistance, vibration therapy, and interactive games, it can provide targeted exercises to improve hand-eye coordination, muscle strength, and overall dexterity, accelerating recovery processes."
