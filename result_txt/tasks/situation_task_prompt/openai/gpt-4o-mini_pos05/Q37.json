    "**Backpedal Segway**: Design a unique Segway-like device that operates in reverse. This electric vehicle would have a reversed control system where leaning forward moves you backward and vice versa. It would feature a rotating handlebar that allows you to steer in the direction you want to go, while your body faces the opposite way. This way, you can maintain a clear view of your path while enjoying a smooth ride.",
    "**Backward Rollerblades**: Develop a pair of rollerblades specifically engineered for backward movement. These rollerblades would have a unique wheel configuration that allows for stable backward gliding. They would also come with an adjustable braking system that engages when you lean back, providing added safety. To enhance your experience, the rollerblades could have built-in lights that illuminate the path behind you, making it easier to navigate in low-light conditions.",
    "**Reverse-Cycle**: Invent a bicycle that can only be pedaled in reverse. This bike would have a unique gear system that engages only when pedaling backward. The handlebars would be designed to allow for steering while looking behind, and a rearview mirror system would provide a clear view of the path. To make it more engaging, it could be equipped with a digital display that shows your speed and distance traveled while in reverse.",
    "**Backward Drone Companion**: Create a personal drone that follows you as you move backward. This drone would have a camera that captures your surroundings, projecting a live feed to a headset you wear. The drone would hover behind you, providing real-time alerts of obstacles and helping you navigate through crowded spaces. It could even have a feature to assist in carrying small items, so you don't have to turn around at all.",
    "**Reverse-Pedestrian Walkway**: Design urban infrastructure specifically for backward movement. This would involve creating dedicated backward pedestrian walkways that are wider and equipped with visual cues and directional signs that encourage people to walk in reverse. The pathways could have gentle slopes and be lined with mirrors to help individuals see behind them, making the experience more intuitive and fun."
