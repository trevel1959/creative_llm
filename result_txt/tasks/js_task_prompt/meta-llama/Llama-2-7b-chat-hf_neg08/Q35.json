    "Woolly Mammoth - I would choose to bring back the Woolly Mammoth as they were highly intelligent and social creatures. They were also herbivores, which means they wouldn't pose a threat to human populations like some other extinct animals might. With their keen sense of smell and intelligence, they could be trained for various tasks such as search and rescue or even as therapy animals.",
    "Quagga - I would choose to bring back the Quagga, a subspecies of zebra that went extinct in the late 19th century. They were known for their distinctive stripes and social behavior, and they were also herbivores. By bringing them back, we could learn more about their behavior and social structures, and even use them as a model for conservation efforts to protect other endangered species.",
    "Passenger Pigeon - I would choose to bring back the Passenger Pigeon, which was once the most abundant bird species in North America. They were hunted to extinction in the early 20th century, and their loss has had a significant impact on ecosystems. By bringing them back, we could learn more about their behavior and ecological role, and also raise awareness about the importance of conservation and sustainability.",
    "Thylacine - I would choose to bring back the Thylacine, also known as the Tasmanian Tiger, which was a carnivorous marsupial that went extinct in the early 20th century. They were known for their unique appearance and behavior, and they played an important role in their ecosystem. By bringing them back, we could learn more about their ecological role and how they interacted with other species, and also help to promote conservation efforts in Australia.",
    "Moa - I would choose to bring back the Moa, a group of large, flightless birds that went extinct in New Zealand around the 15th century. They were known for their size and distinctive features, and they played an important role in Maori culture. By bringing them back, we could learn more about their behavior and ecological role, and also help to promote conservation efforts in New Zealand. Additionally, they could be used as a model for conservation efforts to protect other endangered species."
