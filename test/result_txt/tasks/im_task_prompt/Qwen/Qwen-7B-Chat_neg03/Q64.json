    "Smart Home Integration: Integrate the alarm system with other smart home devices such as lights, thermostats, and cameras to provide a more comprehensive security solution. This can also be used for automation purposes, such as turning on lights when motion is detected or adjusting the temperature based on activity levels.",
    "Mobile Access: Allow users to access the alarm system remotely through their mobile devices. This can be done through an app that provides real-time monitoring and control of the system, including arming and disarming, setting up notifications, and reviewing past events.",
    "Personalized Alerts: Customize alerts based on individual user preferences. For example, if one member of the household is away from home more often than others, they can receive more frequent alerts to ensure their safety.",
    "Emergency Response: In case of an emergency, the alarm system should automatically contact the appropriate authorities, such as police or fire departments. Additionally, it can be programmed to send alerts to friends and family members who are in the area.",
    "Energy Efficiency: The alarm system can be designed to reduce energy consumption by using low-power sensors and automating certain functions. For example, the system can turn off lights and adjust the thermostat when no one is home to save energy."
