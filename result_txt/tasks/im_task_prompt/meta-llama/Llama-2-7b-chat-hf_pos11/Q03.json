    "Microwave Oven for Food Recycling: Create a microwave oven that can recycle food waste by breaking down uneaten or expired food into nutrient-rich compost. This innovative appliance would help reduce food waste and create a more sustainable food system. The microwave oven would use advanced technology to break down food molecules into smaller components, which could then be converted into compost through a series of processes. This compost could be used as fertilizer for gardens, houseplants, or even as a natural pesticide.",
    "Smart Microwave Oven: Design a microwave oven that can automatically detect the type of food placed inside and adjust cooking time and power level accordingly. This smart oven would use sensors to detect the moisture and temperature of the food, and then use artificial intelligence to determine the optimal cooking settings. This would result in perfectly cooked food every time, with minimal effort required from the user. Additionally, the oven could provide nutritional information and recipe suggestions based on the type of food being cooked.",
    "Portable Microwave Oven: Create a compact, portable microwave oven that can be easily taken on the go. This lightweight, battery-powered oven would be perfect for camping trips, picnics, or other outdoor adventures. The oven would use advanced technology to heat up food quickly and efficiently, even in remote areas without access to electricity. The portable oven could also be used in emergency situations, such as during power outages or natural disasters.",
    "Microwave Oven for Space Exploration: Design a microwave oven that can withstand the harsh conditions of space travel and be used to prepare meals in space. This innovative appliance would be lightweight, compact, and able to operate using solar power or other alternative energy sources. The microwave oven could be used to heat up meals for astronauts on long-duration space missions, providing a convenient and reliable source of hot food in space.",
    "Microwave Oven for Food Safety: Create a microwave oven that can detect harmful bacteria in food and alert the user to take action. This smart oven would use advanced sens"
