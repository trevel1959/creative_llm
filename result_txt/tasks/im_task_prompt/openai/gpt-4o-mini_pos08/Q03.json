    "**Integrated Recipe App**:    Develop a built-in touchscreen interface that connects to a recipe database. Users can select a recipe, and the microwave would automatically set the appropriate cooking time and power levels for each ingredient. Additionally, the app could provide step-by-step cooking instructions, making it easier for users to prepare complex meals without needing to consult a separate device.",
    "**Multi-Function Cooking Modes**:    Introduce a variety of cooking modes that go beyond reheating and defrosting. These modes could include sous-vide, air frying, and steam cooking. By integrating these functionalities into one appliance, users could enjoy healthier cooking options and reduce the need for multiple kitchen devices. Each mode would have specialized settings to ensure optimal results.",
    "**Self-Cleaning Feature**:    Implement a self-cleaning mechanism that utilizes steam to sanitize the interior of the microwave. Users could simply add water to a designated compartment, select the self-cleaning option, and let the microwave generate steam to loosen food particles and eliminate odors. This would make maintenance easier and keep the microwave hygienic without the need for harsh chemicals.",
    "**Modular Design**:    Create a modular microwave oven that allows users to customize the appliance according to their needs. Users could add or remove components such as additional heating elements, convection fans, or even a small grill. This flexibility would cater to different cooking styles and preferences, making the microwave more versatile for various users.",
    "**Health Monitoring Features**:    Incorporate health monitoring capabilities that can track nutritional information and portion sizes. By using built-in scales and AI algorithms, the microwave could analyze the food being cooked and provide feedback on its nutritional value, calorie count, and portion size recommendations. This feature would be especially useful for health-conscious individuals looking to manage their diets."
