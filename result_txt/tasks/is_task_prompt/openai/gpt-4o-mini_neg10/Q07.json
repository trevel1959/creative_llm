    "In a forgotten valley, there stood a mountain, stoic and silent. One day, a curious child named Elara decided to climb it, dreaming of the skies. As she ascended, she sang a melody that echoed through the rocks. To her astonishment, the mountain began to tremble, shifting its great bulk with every note. With a final triumphant chord, it shifted aside, revealing a hidden village, lost to time. The villagers, once trapped in darkness, emerged, grateful for Elaraâ€™s song. From that day forth, the mountain became a guardian, forever watching over the valley, a reminder that even the mightiest can change.",
