    "Incorporate a touch-sensitive interface into the microwave oven, allowing users to easily control the cooking time and power level with simple gestures. This could be achieved through the use of capacitive touch technology.",
    "Develop a smart microwave oven that can automatically detect the type of food being cooked and adjust the cooking time and power level accordingly. This could be done through the use of a built-in sensor that detects the food's electrical conductivity.",
    "Create a microwave oven with a built-in grill function, allowing users to cook a variety of dishes, including grilled meats and vegetables, with minimal cleanup. This could be achieved through the use of a detachable grill pan that fits inside the microwave.",
    "Incorporate a slow-cook function into the microwave oven, allowing users to cook dishes over a longer period of time without having to constantly monitor them. This could be done through the use of a built-in thermostat that maintains a consistent temperature.",
    "Develop a microwave oven with a built-in sous vide function, allowing users to cook dishes to a precise temperature without overcooking or undercooking them. This could be achieved through the use of a built-in temperature control system."
