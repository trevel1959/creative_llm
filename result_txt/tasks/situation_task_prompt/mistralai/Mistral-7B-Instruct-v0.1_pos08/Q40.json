    "Solar-powered devices:Devices can be designed to harness the power of the sun using solar panels. This would eliminate the need for batteries and provide a sustainable source of energy for devices.",
    "Wind-powered devices: Wind turbines can be integrated into devices to generate power. This would require the device to be placed in a location with sufficient wind power.",
    "Hydrogen fuel cell-powered devices: Hydrogen fuel cells can be used to generate power for devices. This technology is still in its early stages, but it has the potential to provide a clean and efficient source of energy.",
    "Hand-crank-powered devices: Devices can be designed with a hand-crank mechanism to generate power. This would require physical effort, but it would provide a portable and sustainable source of energy.",
    "Kinetic energy-powered devices: Kinetic energy can be harnessed from the movement of the device to generate power. This technology is still in its early stages, but it has the potential to provide a sustainable source of energy for devices."
