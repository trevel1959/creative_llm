    "**Community Vision Support Networks**: Establish local support networks where individuals with poor vision can connect with sighted volunteers who can assist them in daily tasks. This could include guided outings, reading services, or even companionship. These networks would foster community bonds and help individuals maintain independence while adapting to their vision challenges.",
    "**Adaptive Home Design**: Encourage the design and renovation of homes to accommodate those with poor vision. This could involve using tactile pathways, contrasting colors for better visibility, and smart home technology that responds to voice commands. Homes could be equipped with sensors that alert individuals to obstacles or provide audio feedback about their surroundings.",
    "**Natural Remedies and Eye Training**: Promote awareness of natural remedies and eye exercises that can potentially improve vision. Workshops could teach individuals how to perform eye relaxation techniques, use herbal supplements, and practice specific visual training exercises designed to strengthen their eye muscles and improve focus.",
    "**Vision-Centric Mobility Solutions**: Create innovative mobility aids, such as smart canes or wearable devices that use sonar technology to detect obstacles and provide audio or haptic feedback to the user. These tools would help individuals navigate their environments safely and confidently, reducing reliance on visual cues.",
    "**Collaborative Art and Expression Programs**: Launch art and expression programs that allow individuals with poor vision to explore creativity through non-visual mediums, such as music, tactile art, or storytelling. These programs would not only provide a therapeutic outlet but also foster community engagement and awareness about vision impairment."
