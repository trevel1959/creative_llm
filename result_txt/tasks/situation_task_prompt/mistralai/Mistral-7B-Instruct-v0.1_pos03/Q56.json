    "One way to see your reflection without mirrors is to use a camera with a flash. The flash can illuminate your face and create a reflection on any nearby surfaces.",
    "Another option is to use a reflective surface like a piece of glass or metal to see your reflection. You could use a small mirror or a larger piece of reflective material.",
    "You could also use a reflective material like a piece of plastic wrap or a reflective sticker to create a makeshift mirror. Simply apply the material to a flat surface and you should be able to see your reflection.",
    "If you have a body of water nearby, you could use it as a mirror. Simply look into the water and you should be able to see your reflection.",
    "Finally, you could use a digital device like a smartphone or tablet to take a selfie and view it on the screen. This will give you a digital representation of your reflection."
