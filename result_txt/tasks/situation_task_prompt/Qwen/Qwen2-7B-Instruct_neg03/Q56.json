    "**Virtual Reality Reflections**: In a world without physical mirrors, individuals could use virtual reality (VR) technology to visualize their reflections. Special VR devices could project an image of the user onto the walls or ceilings around them, allowing them to see themselves from different angles as if they were standing in front of a mirror.",
    "**Water as a Mirror**: People might discover that certain surfaces, like still bodies of water, can serve as reflective mirrors. By finding or creating small ponds or pools, individuals could use these natural or artificial \"mirrors\" to see their reflections.",
    "**Self-Projecting Clothing**: Innovators could develop wearable technology that incorporates micro-projectors and sensors to project a digital representation of the wearer onto their clothing. The projected image would reflect back to the wearer, allowing them to see themselves as if they were looking in a mirror.",
    "**Reflective Fabric and Clothing**: New materials could be developed that have a self-reflective property. These fabrics could be used to create clothing items that would reflect light back to the wearer, enabling them to see their appearance without relying on traditional mirrors.",
    "**Augmented Reality Apps**: Developers could create advanced augmented reality (AR) apps that overlay a digital reflection onto the real world. Using smartphones or dedicated AR glasses, people could see their reflections in various environments, such as walls, windows, or even through holographic projections. This would allow for a more personalized and customizable reflection experience."
