    "**Self-Cleaning Filter System**: Design a vacuum cleaner with a self-cleaning filter mechanism. This system would use vibrations or bursts of air to dislodge dirt and debris from the filter, automatically cleaning it during operation. This would enhance suction power, reduce maintenance frequency, and ensure that the vacuum maintains peak performance without requiring users to manually clean or replace filters frequently.",
    "**Multi-Surface Adaptability**: Develop a vacuum cleaner that can automatically adjust its suction power and brush type based on the surface it’s cleaning. Using sensors, the vacuum could detect whether it’s on carpet, hardwood, tile, or upholstery, and modify its settings accordingly. This would ensure optimal cleaning for all surfaces without requiring user intervention.",
    "**Eco-Friendly Dust Compaction**: Create a vacuum cleaner that features a dust compaction system, allowing it to compress collected debris into smaller, more manageable blocks. This would reduce the frequency of emptying the dust bin and make it easier to dispose of waste. Additionally, the vacuum could use biodegradable materials for its dust bags or containers, promoting environmental sustainability.",
    "**Integrated Air Purifier**: Design a vacuum cleaner that doubles as an air purifier. As it cleans the floors, it would also filter and purify the air, capturing allergens, dust, and odors. This could be achieved through a multi-stage filtration system that includes HEPA filters and activated carbon, ensuring that the air quality in the home improves while vacuuming.",
    "**Augmented Reality Interface**: Implement an augmented reality (AR) interface that provides users with real-time feedback on their cleaning performance. By using a smartphone or AR glasses, users could see a visual representation of areas that have been cleaned versus those that still need attention. This feature could also offer tips for more effective cleaning techniques based on the surfaces and dirt levels detected."
