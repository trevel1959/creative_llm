    "**Multi-Functionality**:    Design a sandwich toaster that doubles as a grill and a panini press. This versatile appliance would have interchangeable plates, allowing users to switch between toasting sandwiches, grilling vegetables, or pressing paninis. Each plate could be designed with non-stick surfaces and easy cleaning features, enhancing its utility in the kitchen.",
    "**Built-in Ingredient Dispenser**:    Incorporate a built-in ingredient dispenser that allows users to add sauces, cheeses, or spreads while the sandwich is toasting. This could be achieved through a small compartment that releases the ingredients at the right time during the cooking process, ensuring even distribution and preventing sogginess.",
    "**Customizable Sandwich Shapes**:    Create a sandwich toaster with interchangeable molds that allow users to create sandwiches in various fun shapes, such as hearts, stars, or animals. This feature would be especially appealing for families with children, making lunchtime more enjoyable and encouraging kids to eat healthier.",
    "**Self-Cleaning Mechanism**:    Introduce a self-cleaning mechanism that uses steam and heat to clean the interior surfaces of the toaster. After use, users could activate this feature, which would help to dissolve food residue and make maintenance hassle-free. This would save time and effort, encouraging regular use without the worry of cleanup.",
    "**Integrated Recipe Guide**:    Add an interactive digital display that features a recipe guide with step-by-step instructions for creating different types of sandwiches. Users could browse through various options, including gourmet recipes, and the toaster would adjust cooking times and temperatures based on the selected recipe, taking the guesswork out of the process."
