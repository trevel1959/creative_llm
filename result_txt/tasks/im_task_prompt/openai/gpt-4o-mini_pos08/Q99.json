    "**Adjustable Tape Width Feature**:    Design a tape dispenser with a sliding mechanism that allows users to adjust the width of the tape being dispensed. This feature would be especially useful for crafts and packaging, where different tape widths are needed for various applications. Users could easily switch between standard widths without needing multiple dispensers.",
    "**Magnetic Base and Wall Mount**:    Create a tape dispenser with a magnetic base that can stick to metal surfaces, like filing cabinets or toolboxes. Additionally, include a wall mount option for easy access in workshops or crafting spaces. This would save desk space and ensure the tape is always within reach.",
    "**Built-in Cutter with Safety Features**:    Innovate a tape dispenser that includes a built-in cutter with safety features. Instead of a traditional blade, use a ceramic or plastic cutting edge that can slice through tape without the risk of injury. The design could also include a retractable feature that hides the cutting edge when not in use.",
    "**Eco-Friendly Refill System**:    Introduce a refillable tape dispenser that uses eco-friendly tape made from biodegradable materials. Users can purchase tape refills in bulk, reducing packaging waste. The dispenser itself could be made from recycled materials, appealing to environmentally conscious consumers.",
    "**Multi-Tape Carousel**:    Design a carousel-style tape dispenser that holds multiple rolls of tape at once. Users can easily switch between different types of tape (e.g., double-sided, washi, masking) with a simple turn of the carousel. This would be ideal for artists and crafters who frequently switch between tape types."
