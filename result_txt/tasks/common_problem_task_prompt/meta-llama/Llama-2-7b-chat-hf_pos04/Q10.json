    "Floating House: Create a home that appears to be suspended in mid-air, giving the illusion of weightlessness. This can be achieved through a cantilevered design, where the floors and walls are supported by slender columns and beams, giving the impression of a house floating on a cushion of air. The interior can feature large windows and sliding glass doors to enhance the sense of weightlessness and provide breathtaking views of the surrounding landscape.",
    "Eco-Friendly Green Roof: Design a home with a lush, green roof that doubles as a garden and rainwater harvesting system. The roof can be covered with a variety of plants, including herbs, vegetables, and flowers, which can provide a natural and sustainable source of food and beauty. The roof can also be equipped with a rainwater collection system, which can store and filter rainwater for irrigation and other household uses.",
    "Modular Micro-Home: Create a home that is composed of multiple, modular units that can be easily assembled and disassembled as needed. Each module can be designed to serve a specific purpose, such as a bedroom, kitchen, or living area, and can be connected to form a larger, more complex home. This design can provide flexibility and adaptability, as well as a more sustainable and efficient use of space.",
    "Inflatable Home: Design a home that is inflated like a balloon, providing a unique and playful form of architecture. The inflatable structure can be made of a durable, puncture-resistant material, such as PVC or latex, and can be filled with air or other gases for added insulation and support. The interior can feature flexible, modular walls and ceilings that can be rearranged or reconfigured as needed, providing a sense of freedom and adaptability.",
    "Vertical Garden Home: Create a home that is entirely covered in plants and greenery, blurring the lines between indoor and outdoor space. The home can be designed with a series of interconnected, vertical gardens that provide a natural and sustainable source of insulation and air purification. The plants can also provide a sense of privacy and security, as well as a beautiful and peaceful living environment."
