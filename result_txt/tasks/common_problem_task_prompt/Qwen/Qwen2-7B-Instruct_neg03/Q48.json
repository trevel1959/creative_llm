    "**Aquatic Basketball**: A hybrid of basketball and water polo that takes place in a large pool or lake. The game can be played indoors or outdoors, depending on the availability of a suitable location. Teams are divided into two or three players, each attempting to score baskets by throwing balls into hoops placed at various points around the pool. This idea combines elements of strategy (like positioning and defensive plays) with physical endurance and swimming skills.",
    "**Sky Sports**: A series of sports that take place in the sky, such as sky cycling, sky running, or sky climbing. These activities involve participants engaging in traditional sports like cycling, running, or climbing but at high altitudes using specialized equipment designed for aerial conditions. For example, sky cycling could be a competition where cyclists ride on custom-made bicycles suspended from a cable system at a height above the ground. This concept challenges athletes in new ways, pushing their physical limits and requiring unique skill sets.",

This concept blends classic strategy with a futuristic twist, offering a unique gaming experience.",

Glowing sports could include traditional games like soccer, basketball, or volleyball, adapted for nighttime play."
