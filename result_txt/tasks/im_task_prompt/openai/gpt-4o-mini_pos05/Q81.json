    "**Smart Spatula with Temperature Sensor**: Develop a spatula embedded with a temperature sensor that connects to a smartphone app via Bluetooth. The spatula could alert the user when the cooking surface reaches the optimal temperature for different types of food (e.g., pancakes, meats, etc.). This would help prevent overcooking or burning food and ensure perfectly cooked meals every time.",
    "**Spatula with Interchangeable Heads**: Create a spatula with a base that allows for interchangeable heads designed for specific cooking tasks. For example, one head could be flat for flipping burgers, another could be slotted for draining grease, and a third could be rounded for scraping bowls. This versatility would make it easier for cooks to switch between tasks without needing multiple utensils.",
    "**Ergonomic Spatula with Adjustable Handle**: Design a spatula with an adjustable handle that can be modified in length and angle. This would cater to different cooking styles and preferences, allowing users to extend the handle for deep frying or adjust the angle for flipping delicate foods. The ergonomic design would reduce wrist strain, making it more comfortable for extended use.",
    "**Spatula with Built-in Storage Compartment**: Create a spatula with a hollow handle that can store small kitchen tools like a bottle opener, knife, or even a small brush for basting. This would provide convenience for the user, allowing them to keep essential tools handy without cluttering the kitchen counter.",
    "**Color-Changing Spatula**: Develop a spatula made from heat-sensitive materials that change color based on the temperature of the food being cooked. For instance, it could turn red when the surface is too hot or green when itâ€™s at the perfect temperature. This visual cue would help prevent burns and ensure food is cooked properly."
