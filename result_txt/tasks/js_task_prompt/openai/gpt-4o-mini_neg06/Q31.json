    "**Community Memory Banks**: Create local community memory banks where families can upload videos, photos, and voice recordings of significant moments in their loved ones’ lives. These digital archives would serve as a therapeutic tool for Alzheimer’s patients, enabling them to engage with their past in a meaningful way. Caregivers could use these resources to stimulate conversations and memories, fostering deeper connections.",
    "**Virtual Reality Reminiscence Therapy**: Develop a virtual reality program that immerses Alzheimer’s patients in familiar environments from their past. By recreating places like their childhood home, favorite vacation spots, or even historical events, patients can relive experiences that may trigger memories. This immersive therapy could help reduce anxiety and improve mood, offering moments of joy and recognition.",
    "**Personalized Gene Therapy**: Invest in research for a personalized gene therapy approach that targets the specific genetic mutations associated with familial Alzheimer’s disease. By correcting these mutations at the DNA level, we could prevent the onset of the disease in at-risk individuals, effectively halting the progression before it even begins.",
    "**Cognitive Companion Robots**: Design and deploy cognitive companion robots equipped with AI that can engage Alzheimer’s patients in conversation, play games, and provide reminders for daily tasks. These robots would be programmed to adapt to the patient’s cognitive level, ensuring meaningful interactions and helping maintain cognitive function while providing companionship.",
    "**Art Therapy Integration**: Establish art therapy programs that specifically cater to Alzheimer’s patients, allowing them to express themselves through various art forms. These programs would focus on creativity rather than the final product, providing an outlet for emotions and thoughts that may be difficult to articulate verbally. Exhibitions could showcase their work, promoting awareness and appreciation of their experiences."
