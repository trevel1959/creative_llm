    "Innovative Ski Pole Design: Create a ski pole with an integrated LED light system, allowing skiers to enjoy their descent into the night. The light could be powered by a rechargeable battery, providing an extra layer of safety for nighttime skiing. The design could also include a built-in compass, helping skiers navigate unfamiliar trails.",
    "Adaptive Ski Pole Technology: Develop a ski pole with an ergonomic grip and an adjustable shaft length, catering to various user preferences and abilities. The grip could feature a textured surface for better grip, and the shaft could be collapsible for easier storage and transportation. This technology would enable skiers with disabilities to enjoy the sport with greater comfort and ease.",
    "Ski Pole-Mounted Camera: Design a ski pole with a built-in camera, capturing stunning footage of the skier's descent. The camera could be controlled through a small display screen on the handle, allowing the skier to switch between different angles and capture unique perspectives. This innovation would allow skiers to relive their adventures and share their experiences with friends and family.",
    "Smart Ski Pole: Create a ski pole with a range of integrated sensors, monitoring the skier's speed, altitude, and other vital statistics. The data could be synced to a mobile app, providing real-time feedback on the skier's performance and offering suggestions for improvement. This technology would enable skiers to optimize their technique and push their limits with greater confidence.",
    "Collaborative Ski Pole: Design a ski pole with a unique shared handle design, allowing two or more skiers to connect their poles together and ski together. This innovation would foster a sense of camaraderie and teamwork, enhancing the social aspect of skiing.
