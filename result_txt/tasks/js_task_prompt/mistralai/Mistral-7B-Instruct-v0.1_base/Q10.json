    "The invention of the printing press: I would change the invention of the printing press to the invention of the printing press in the 19th century. The printing press was invented by Johannes Gutenberg in the 15th century, and while it revolutionized the spread of information, it was still limited by the fact that books were made by hand. By changing the invention of the printing press to the 19th century, I would allow for the development of modern printing technology, which would have had a huge impact on the spread of knowledge and the dissemination of information.",

    "The discovery of the Higgs boson: I would change the discovery of the Higgs boson to have been made in the 1980s. The Higgs boson is a subatomic particle that is thought to give other particles mass. Its discovery in 2012 was a major breakthrough in particle physics. By changing the discovery of the Higgs boson to have been made in the 1980s, I would have been able to understand the fundamental nature of the universe much earlier, and this knowledge could have had a huge impact on many different fields of science.",
    "The invention of the internet: I would change the invention of the internet to have been made in the 1980s. The internet was invented in the 1960s by the United States Department of Defense, but it took many years for it to become widely available and for people to start using it. By changing the invention of the internet to have been made in the 1980s, I would have been able to see the full potential of the internet much earlier and would have been able to use it to connect with people and share information in ways that were not possible before.",
