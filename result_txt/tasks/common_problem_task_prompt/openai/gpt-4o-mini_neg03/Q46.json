    "**Public Resistance to Change**: Residents may be resistant to changes in the transportation system, especially if they have grown accustomed to existing routes and schedules. Public hearings or forums may reveal deep-seated fears about increased costs, loss of access to certain areas, or the perceived inconvenience of new systems. This resistance can hinder implementation and lead to protests or negative media coverage.",
    "**Infrastructure Challenges**: Many cities have aging infrastructure that may not support new transportation technologies or systems, such as electric buses or light rail. Upgrading roads, bridges, and stations can be a significant logistical challenge, requiring extensive construction work that may disrupt existing traffic patterns and cause delays, inconveniencing commuters and local businesses.",
    "**Environmental Concerns**: While overhauling the public transportation system aims to reduce carbon emissions, the construction phase can have adverse environmental impacts. There may be concerns about increased pollution during construction, disruption of local ecosystems, or the loss of green spaces. Stakeholders may need to conduct environmental impact assessments and develop mitigation strategies to address these issues.",
    "**Integration with Existing Systems**: A new transportation system must integrate seamlessly with existing services to be effective. Issues may arise in coordinating schedules, ticketing systems, and route planning between different modes of transport (e.g., buses, trains, bicycles). Poor integration can lead to confusion among riders and decreased overall usage of the public transportation system.",
    "**Technology Implementation and Maintenance**: The introduction of new technologies, such as smart ticketing systems or real-time tracking apps, can pose challenges in terms of implementation and ongoing maintenance. There may be issues with data security, user accessibility, or the digital divide affecting low-income populations. Ensuring that technology is user-friendly and reliable is crucial for public adoption."
