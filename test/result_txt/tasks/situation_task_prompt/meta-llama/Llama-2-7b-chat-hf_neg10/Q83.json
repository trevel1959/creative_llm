    "Sleep Pods: With no more nighttime, people could use sleep pods that simulate the effects of darkness and help them sleep. These pods could be equipped with advanced lighting technology that mimics the natural light-dark cycle, complete with sunrise and sunset simulations. They could also include soothing sounds and aromatherapy to enhance the sleep experience.",
    "Circadian Rhythm Training: Without nighttime, people could undergo training to adjust their internal clocks to optimize their sleep schedules. This training could involve exposure to various light intensities and durations, as well as other stimuli that help regulate the body's natural sleep-wake cycle.",
    "Sleep-Enhancing Drugs: A new class of drugs could be developed that specifically target the sleep-wake cycle and help people sleep more efficiently. These drugs could be designed to mimic the effects of darkness on the body, or they could work by stimulating the production of melatonin, the hormone that regulates sleep.",
    "Virtual Reality Sleep Environments: With no more nighttime, people could use virtual reality technology to create immersive sleep environments that simulate the feeling of darkness. These environments could include calming scenery, soothing sounds, and even virtual companions to help people relax and fall asleep.",
    "Artificial Sunlight: In a world without nighttime, people could use artificial sunlight to simulate the effects of the sun on their circadian rhythms. This could involve using specialized lamps or light panels that emit light with the same spectral composition as natural sunlight, or even using mirrors to reflect sunlight from a nearby window or other source."
