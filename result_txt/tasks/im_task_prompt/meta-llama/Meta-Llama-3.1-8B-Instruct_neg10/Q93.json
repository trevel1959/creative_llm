    "**Aerodynamic Fins**: Integrate aerodynamic fins into the design of the bowling ball to reduce air resistance and improve its speed and accuracy. These fins would be made of a lightweight, durable material and would be designed to minimize interference with the ball's motion.",
    "**Adjustable Weight Distribution**: Develop a bowling ball with adjustable weight distribution, allowing bowlers to customize the balance and feel of the ball to suit their individual preferences. This feature would be achieved through a system of interchangeable weights or a dynamic weight transfer system.",
    "**Impact-Absorbing Core**: Incorporate an impact-absorbing core into the bowling ball to reduce the shock and vibration caused by collisions with the pins. This would make the game more comfortable for bowlers and potentially reduce the risk of injury.",
    "**Smart Ball Technology**: Create a bowling ball with integrated sensors and tracking technology, allowing bowlers to monitor their speed, spin, and accuracy in real-time. This feature would provide valuable insights for bowlers to improve their technique and performance.",
    "**Ergonomic Grip**: Design a bowling ball with an ergonomic grip that provides a comfortable, secure hold for bowlers of all hand sizes and shapes. This feature would be achieved through a contoured grip surface or an adjustable grip system."
