    "**Innovative Car Dashboard Design**: Design a new type of steering wheel that integrates a smart dashboard system directly into it. This steering wheel would have touch-sensitive pads that allow drivers to control their car's entertainment, navigation, and safety systems without taking their eyes off the road. The wheel could also incorporate haptic feedback for more immersive control experiences.",
    "**Adaptive Steering Wheel for Rehabilitation**: Develop a customizable steering wheel that adapts to various disabilities, such as limited mobility or vision impairments. This could involve incorporating adjustable grip textures, voice commands, and even eye-tracking technology to make driving accessible for a wider range of individuals.",
    "**Steering Wheel as a Fitness Tool**: Create a connected fitness device in the form of a smart steering wheel. It can track metrics like heart rate, calories burned, and distance covered while driving, making exercise a continuous process throughout the day. Users could set goals, monitor progress, and compete with friends on an online leaderboard, transforming daily commutes into workouts.",
    "**Sustainable Material Innovations**: Use sustainable materials, such as recycled plastics or natural fibers, to create eco-friendly steering wheels. These wheels not only reduce environmental impact but also offer unique aesthetic designs and textures. Companies could partner with eco-conscious consumers by offering customizations that reflect personal values and sustainability.",
    "**Augmented Reality (AR) Enhanced Driving Experience**: Implement AR technology within the steering wheel to provide real-time information about traffic, weather conditions, and potential hazards. This could include projected navigation arrows, lane change indicators, and even warnings about nearby cyclists or pedestrians. The AR steering wheel would enhance safety and efficiency on the roads, potentially reducing accidents and improving traffic flow."
