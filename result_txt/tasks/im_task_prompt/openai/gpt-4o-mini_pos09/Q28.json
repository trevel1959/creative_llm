    "**Modular Helmet System**: Design a helmet with a modular approach, allowing users to customize their helmet with interchangeable components. This could include different outer shells for various styles (e.g., urban, mountain biking), removable padding for comfort and hygiene, and add-ons like visors or lights. This customization could also extend to colors and patterns, allowing cyclists to express their personality while ensuring safety.",
    "**Integrated Communication System**: Create a helmet with built-in Bluetooth speakers and a microphone for hands-free communication. Cyclists can take calls, listen to music, or communicate with fellow riders without the need for earbuds, which can block out ambient noise. The system could also include noise-cancellation features to reduce wind noise and enhance audio clarity.",
    "**Advanced Impact Sensors**: Equip the helmet with smart sensors that can detect impacts and automatically alert emergency contacts or services. The sensors can measure the severity of the impact and send GPS coordinates to ensure quick assistance if needed. This feature could provide peace of mind for solo riders and their loved ones.",
    "**Self-Cleaning Technology**: Incorporate a self-cleaning feature using advanced materials that repel dirt and grime. This could be achieved through a special coating that prevents sweat and debris from adhering to the helmet's surface. Additionally, integrating antimicrobial properties in the padding could help keep the interior clean and odor-free, enhancing hygiene for frequent users.",
    "**Climate Control System**: Design a helmet with built-in ventilation and temperature regulation. This could include adjustable vents that cyclists can open or close based on weather conditions, as well as a small fan system that circulates air to keep the rider cool. In colder conditions, the helmet could have a warming feature, such as heated pads, to maintain comfort during winter rides."
