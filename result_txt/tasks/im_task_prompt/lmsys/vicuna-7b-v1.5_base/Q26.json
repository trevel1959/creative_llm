    "Solar-Powered Trash Can: Design a trash can with a built-in solar panel that charges a battery during the day, allowing the can to operate without the need for an external power source at night. This would reduce the environmental impact of trash collection and transportation.",
    "Compact Trash Can: Create a trash can that can be easily folded or collapsed, allowing it to take up less space when not in use. This would be particularly useful in urban areas where space is limited.",
    "Self-Cleaning Trash Can: Incorporate a UV-C light and water filtration system into the design of the trash can to enable it to clean itself automatically. This would reduce the need for manual cleaning and help to prevent odors and bacterial growth.",
    "Trash Can with Built-in Composting: Design a trash can with a separate compartment for composting food waste. This would help to reduce the amount of food waste sent to landfills and promote sustainable waste management practices.",
    "Trash Can with Biometric Authentication: Add a biometric authentication system to the trash can, allowing only authorized users to access the contents. This would help to prevent theft and vandalism, as well as ensure that only authorized individuals have access to the waste for recycling or disposal."
