    "Overcrowding: Another potential problem is overcrowding, which can occur when too many tourists visit a city at once. This can lead to traffic congestion, long lines, and overburdened public facilities.",
    "Environmental degradation: Developing a city's tourism industry can also lead to environmental degradation, such as water and air pollution, loss of natural habitats, and waste management issues.",
    "Economic inequality: The tourism industry can also exacerbate economic inequality, as wealthy tourists can spend more money and have better experiences, while local residents may not benefit as much from the industry.",
    "Cultural erosion: The tourism industry can also lead to cultural erosion, as tourists may be more interested in experiencing the city's popular attractions rather than immersing themselves in the local culture.",
    "Safety and security concerns: Safety and security concerns can also arise in the context of tourism, as tourists may be targeted by criminals or experience safety issues while traveling."
