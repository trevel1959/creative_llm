    "Limited Resources: Organic farming often requires more resources than conventional farming, such as specialized equipment and organic fertilizers. This could be a problem for farmers who have limited resources or financial constraints.",
    "Pest and Disease Control: Organic farming relies on natural methods to control pests and diseases, which can be difficult to implement effectively. This could result in crop damage and reduced yields.",
    "Market Demand: There may be a limited market for organic produce, which could make it difficult for farmers to sell their products and recoup their costs.",
    "Weather: Organic farming is sensitive to weather conditions, such as droughts and heavy rainfall, which can negatively impact crop yields.",
    "Regulatory Compliance: Organic farmers must comply with strict regulations and standards to maintain their organic certification. Failure to do so could result in the loss of certification and access to the organic market."
