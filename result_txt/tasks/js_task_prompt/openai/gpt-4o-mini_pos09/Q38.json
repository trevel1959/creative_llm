    "**Conflict Resolution**: In situations of personal or communal conflict, I would employ this power to help individuals articulate their true feelings and motivations. By compelling people to speak honestly about their grievances, underlying issues could be addressed more effectively. This would not only promote healing but also help build stronger relationships, as parties would have a clearer understanding of each other's perspectives and intentions.",
    "**Criminal Justice Reform**: I would use this ability to uncover the truth in criminal investigations. Witnesses, suspects, and victims would be compelled to share accurate accounts of events, which could lead to quicker resolutions of cases and the exoneration of the innocent. This would help to restore faith in the justice system and reduce wrongful convictions, ultimately leading to a fairer society.",
    "**Medical Ethics**: In the medical field, I would use this power to ensure that patients receive complete and truthful information about their diagnoses and treatment options. By compelling healthcare providers to disclose all relevant information, patients would be empowered to make informed decisions about their health. This could improve patient outcomes and foster a culture of transparency in healthcare, reducing the prevalence of medical malpractice and enhancing trust between patients and providers.",
    "**Political Accountability**: I would harness this ability to promote accountability among politicians and public officials. During debates, interviews, and press conferences, they would be required to speak the truth about their policies, past actions, and intentions. This could lead to a more informed electorate and encourage politicians to prioritize the public good over personal or party interests, ultimately enhancing democratic processes.",
    "**Personal Relationships**: In the realm of personal relationships, I would use this power to help friends and partners communicate openly and honestly about their feelings and expectations. This could eliminate misunderstandings and foster deeper connections, as individuals would no longer hide their true thoughts out of fear of judgment or conflict. Healthy communication could lead to stronger bonds and a greater understanding of one another."
