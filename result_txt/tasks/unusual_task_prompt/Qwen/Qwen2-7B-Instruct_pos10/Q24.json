    "**Electric Toothbrush with Customizable Heads**: Create an electric toothbrush that allows users to customize their brushing experience. Users can choose from different types of brush heads (e.g., sensitive, deep clean, whitening) or even add their own custom-designed heads for a personalized touch. Each head can be designed with unique bristle patterns or materials to target specific oral health needs.",
    "**Smart Toothbrush with Oral Health Monitoring**: Develop a smart toothbrush that integrates with smartphone apps to monitor brushing habits, such as pressure applied, duration, and areas missed. The app can provide real-time feedback during brushing sessions, suggest improvements, and track progress over time. It could also send reminders and motivational messages based on usage patterns.",
    "**Teeth Whitening Toothbrush**: Design a toothbrush that incorporates teeth whitening technology into its design. The brush might have built-in LED lights that emit a specific wavelength to enhance the whitening process. Alternatively, the bristles could be coated with gentle whitening agents that gradually remove surface stains during brushing.",
    "**Oral Hygiene Reminder Toothbrush**: Create a toothbrush that uses artificial intelligence to learn a user's brushing routine and reminds them when it's time to replace the brush head or visit the dentist. The toothbrush could be connected to a mobile app where users input their brushing schedule, and the app sends notifications accordingly. This feature helps ensure consistent oral hygiene maintenance and prevents potential dental issues.",
    "**Eco-Friendly Toothbrush with Rechargeable Handle**: Design a toothbrush with a handle made from sustainable materials like bamboo or recycled plastics. The handle would be rechargeable, eliminating the need for disposable batteries or plastic packaging. The toothbrush heads could be easily detachable and recyclable, promoting responsible waste management. Additionally, the handle could include features like a built-in timer or pressure sensor, enhancing the brushing experience while being environmentally conscious."
