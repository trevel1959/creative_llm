    "**Built-in Measuring Guide**: Integrate a measuring guide along the blade of the scissors. This guide could be printed in both metric and imperial units, allowing users to cut materials to precise lengths without needing a separate ruler. The measuring tape could be retractable, ensuring it doesn’t get in the way during regular use.",
    "**Safety Locking Mechanism**: Introduce a safety locking mechanism that can be engaged when the scissors are not in use. This could be a simple push-button lock that secures the blades in a closed position, preventing accidental cuts.

For example, the scissors could include a small built-in knife for slicing, a bottle opener, and a screwdriver. This would make them a versatile tool for various tasks, ideal for crafting, camping, or general home use.",
    "**LED Light and Magnifying Lens**: Equip the scissors with a small LED light and a magnifying lens at the tip. This feature would be especially useful for intricate cutting tasks or for users with visual impairments. The light would illuminate the cutting area, while the magnifying lens would help users see fine details, making precision cutting easier.",
    "**Smart Scissors with Digital Measurement**: Develop smart scissors that connect to a smartphone app via Bluetooth. The app could provide real-time measurements and cutting guides, helping users make precise cuts based on their specific needs. Additionally, it could include tutorials for various cutting techniques, enhancing the user’s skills."
