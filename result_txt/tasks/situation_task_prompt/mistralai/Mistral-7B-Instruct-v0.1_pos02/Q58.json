    "Use drones to spray pesticides: Drones equipped with pesticide sprayers can be used to target insects and other pests in specific areas, reducing the amount of chemicals used and minimizing the impact on the environment.",
    "Implement biological control: Introducing natural predators or parasites of the pests can help to control their populations. For example, releasing ladybugs to control aphids or introducing a parasitic wasp to control caterpillars.",
    "Use natural pesticides: Certain plants and herbs have natural pesticide properties that can be used to control insects. For example, chrysanthemums contain a compound that is toxic to insects, while neem oil can be used as a natural insecticide.",
    "Implement integrated pest management: This approach involves using a combination of different methods to control pests, such as cultural practices, biological control, and chemical pesticides. This can help to reduce the reliance on pesticides and minimize the impact on the environment.",
    "Develop new technologies: Research and development can lead to the creation of new technologies and methods for controlling pests. For example, scientists are working on developing genetically modified crops that are resistant to pests, reducing the need for pesticides."
