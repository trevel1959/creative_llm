    "**Food Supply**: Surviving without a consistent food source poses a significant challenge. While some islands may have edible fruits, nuts, or plants, identifying which are safe to consume can be difficult. To mitigate this risk, survivors should learn basic foraging techniques and possibly set up traps for small animals or fish. Creating a small garden with fast-growing plants could also provide a sustainable food source over time.",
    "**Shelter Construction**: Exposure to the elements can lead to hypothermia or heat exhaustion. Building a sturdy shelter is essential for protection against rain, wind, and sun. Survivors could use fallen branches, leaves, and natural materials to construct a makeshift hut. The shelter should be elevated to avoid flooding and ideally located near resources like water and food.",
    "**Navigation and Communication**: If rescue is a priority, being able to signal for help is crucial. Survivors might face the challenge of being unable to navigate their surroundings or attract attention from passing ships or planes. Creating large SOS signals on the beach using rocks or logs, or making smoke signals with a fire, can increase visibility. If they have any means of communication, like a whistle or mirror, these should be utilized strategically.",
    "**Health Risks**: Injuries, infections, or illnesses can arise in a survival situation. The lack of medical supplies makes this a serious concern. Survivors should prioritize hygiene, using natural remedies when possible, and learn basic first aid skills. Creating a makeshift first aid kit from natural resources, such as using plant leaves for bandages, can help manage minor injuries until rescue.",
    "**Mental Health Struggles**: The psychological toll of isolation and uncertainty can lead to anxiety, depression, or despair. To combat this, survivors should establish a daily routine that includes tasks like gathering food, maintaining the shelter, and practicing self-care. Keeping a journal or finding creative outlets, like drawing in the sand or crafting items from natural materials, can help maintain a positive mindset."
