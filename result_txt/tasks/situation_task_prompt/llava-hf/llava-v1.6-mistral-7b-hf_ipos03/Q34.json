    "Water Delivery: Arrange for regular water deliveries from a local water supplier or use a water truck to transport water to the plants. This would require a schedule and coordination to ensure the plants receive adequate water.",
    "Greywater Recycling: Implement a greywater recycling system to reuse wastewater from household activities like showers, washing machines, and sinks. This water can be treated and filtered to make it suitable for plant irrigation.",
    "Solar-powered Water Pump: Install a solar-powered water pump to extract water from a nearby well or underground aquifer. The pump would use solar energy to pump water to the surface, which can then be used to water the plants.",
    "Artificial Rain: Create an artificial rain system that sprays water onto the plants using a network of sprinklers or drippers. This could be powered by electricity or a backup generator in case of power outages.",
    "Community Water Sharing: Establish a community water sharing system where neighbors pool their resources to ensure everyone has access to water for their plants. This could involve sharing water trucks, tanker trucks, or water delivery services."
