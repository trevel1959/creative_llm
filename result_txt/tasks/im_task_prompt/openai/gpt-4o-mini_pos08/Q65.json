    "**Built-in Water Filtration System**: Enhance the kettle by incorporating a built-in water filtration system. This feature would purify tap water before boiling, removing impurities and improving the taste of the water. Users could easily replace the filter, and the kettle could have a filter life indicator to remind them when it's time for a change. This would be particularly beneficial in areas with hard water or contaminants.",
    "**Self-Cleaning Functionality**: Introduce a self-cleaning feature that uses ultrasonic waves or steam to eliminate limescale and other build-up inside the kettle. Users could activate this function with a button press, and the kettle would notify them when the cleaning cycle is complete. This would save time and effort in maintaining the kettle's cleanliness, ensuring it remains in optimal condition for brewing.",
    "**Multi-Functional Lid Design**: Create a lid that doubles as a measuring cup and a pour-over filter. The lid could have measurement markings for easy portion control, allowing users to measure out ingredients like tea leaves or coffee grounds directly. Additionally, a built-in fine mesh filter could be incorporated into the lid, enabling users to brew loose-leaf tea or coffee directly in the kettle without needing separate equipment.",
    "**Eco-Friendly Energy Source**: Develop an electric kettle that can operate using solar energy or has a built-in rechargeable battery. This kettle could come with a solar panel attachment or a docking station that harnesses solar energy, making it a sustainable option for environmentally conscious consumers. It would also have a backup charging option for indoor use, ensuring it remains functional regardless of energy sources.",
    "**Personalized Brew Profiles**: Implement a user interface that allows for the creation of personalized brew profiles. Users could save their preferred settings for different beverages, such as the amount of water, temperature, and steeping time. This feature would enable quick access to their favorite brews, enhancing the overall user experience. The kettle could even learn from user preferences over time and suggest new recipes or adjustments."
