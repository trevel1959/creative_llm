    "In a quaint village, a parrot named Pico lived in a vibrant pet shop. Unlike other parrots, Pico had a peculiar quirk—he couldn’t repeat what he heard. The shop owner, Mrs. Whittle, worried no one would buy him. One day, a lonely child named Mia entered the shop, feeling sad. Instead of mimicking words, Pico danced and made silly faces, bringing a smile to her face. Intrigued, Mia took him home. They became inseparable friends, and Pico’s uniqueness taught Mia the beauty of authentic expression. Together, they created their own language of laughter and joy, proving that true connection transcends words.",
