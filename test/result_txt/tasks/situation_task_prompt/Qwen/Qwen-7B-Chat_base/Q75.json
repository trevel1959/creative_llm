    "Utilize alternative fuels: With the increasing awareness of environmental issues, people are looking for alternatives to traditional fossil fuels. One idea could be to promote the use of electric or hybrid cars that run on electricity generated from renewable sources like solar, wind, or hydro power. This would not only reduce our dependence on oil but also help in reducing carbon emissions.",
    "Develop hydrogen fuel cells: Hydrogen fuel cells are a clean source of energy that produce electricity by combining hydrogen with oxygen. If the world's oil supply were to dry up, we could invest in developing hydrogen fuel cells for transportation purposes. These fuel cells can be refueled using water, making them a sustainable solution for powering vehicles.",
    "Encourage carpooling and public transportation: Another way to reduce our dependence on oil is to encourage carpooling and the use of public transportation. People can share rides with others going to the same destination, which reduces the number of cars on the road. Public transportation systems like buses and trains can be made more efficient and affordable, making it an attractive option for commuters.",
    "Implement smart city initiatives: Smart cities use technology to optimize resource usage and reduce waste. For example, sensors can be installed in traffic lights to optimize traffic flow, reducing congestion and fuel consumption. Additionally, smart parking systems can help drivers find available parking spots quickly, reducing unnecessary driving and fuel usage.",
    "Promote biking and walking: Biking and walking are great ways to get around without relying on gasoline-powered vehicles. Encouraging the use of bikes and sidewalks in urban areas can reduce traffic congestion and improve air quality. Additionally, investing in bike lanes and pedestrian-friendly infrastructure can make these modes of transportation safer and more accessible."
