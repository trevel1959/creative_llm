    "**Rainwater Harvesting System**: Design a watering can that collects rainwater during rainy days. This can be equipped with a filter to ensure the water is clean and free from debris. The collected water can then be used to water plants when there's no rain or during droughts. This idea not only conserves water but also makes efficient use of natural resources.",
    "**Self-Watering Can**: Develop a watering can with an internal reservoir and an automatic watering mechanism. When the soil needs water, the system detects this through sensors and automatically adds water from the reservoir. This is especially useful for busy individuals who might forget to water their plants regularly.",
    "**Compostable Watering Can**: Create a watering can made from biodegradable materials like bamboo or recycled paper. These can be designed to hold water and also decompose over time in a compost pile. This reduces waste and encourages sustainability by turning a gardening tool into a component of your garden's organic matter.",
    "**LED Lighted Watering Can**: Integrate small LED lights into the handle of the watering can. These lights could illuminate the way in poorly lit gardens or greenhouses, making it easier to navigate while watering at night. Additionally, they could include a battery-powered light-up feature that turns on when the can is lifted, saving energy when not in use.",
    "**Sustainable Plant Markers**: Instead of using traditional tags, design a watering can with a built-in plant marker system. Each watering can could have slots where you can insert plant labels made from eco-friendly materials such as recycled plastic or biodegradable paper. This system not only helps in identifying plants but also reduces clutter and waste around the garden."
