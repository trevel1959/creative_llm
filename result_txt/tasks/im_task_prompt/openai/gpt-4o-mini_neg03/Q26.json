    "**Odor Neutralizing System**: Integrate an odor-neutralizing system using natural enzymes or activated charcoal filters within the trash can. This system could automatically release neutralizing agents when it detects strong odors, keeping the surrounding area fresh and pleasant, especially in kitchens or bathrooms.",
    "**Solar-Powered Compactor**: Create a solar-powered trash can that compresses waste to maximize space. This would be especially useful in public areas where trash cans fill up quickly. The compactor could be activated by sensors that detect when the can is full, making it eco-friendly and reducing the frequency of waste collection.",
    "**Interactive Recycling Guide**: Equip the trash can with a small touchscreen interface that provides users with information on how to properly dispose of different items. The interface could include a QR code scanner that gives instant feedback on whether an item is recyclable, compostable, or trash, along with tips on reducing waste.",
    "**Subscription-Based Waste Management App**: Pair the trash can with a mobile app that tracks waste disposal habits and provides personalized feedback on how to reduce waste. Users could receive weekly reports, tips, and even rewards for achieving recycling goals. The app could also notify users when itâ€™s time for collection or when the trash can is full.",
    "**Community Engagement Feature**: Design a trash can that includes a community board where people can post messages about local clean-up events, recycling drives, or sustainability tips. This could foster a sense of community and encourage collective efforts toward better waste management."
