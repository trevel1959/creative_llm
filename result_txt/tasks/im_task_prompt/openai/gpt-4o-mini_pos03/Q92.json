    "**Multi-Function Wine Opener**: Create a versatile wine opener that combines several functions into one device. It could include a corkscrew, foil cutter, and wine aerator. The aerator could be designed to attach directly to the wine opener, allowing for a seamless transition from opening to aerating. This would reduce the number of tools needed and streamline the wine-opening experience.",
    "**Self-Cleaning Wine Opener**: Introduce a wine opener with a self-cleaning feature. After use, the opener could have a built-in mechanism that sprays a gentle cleaning solution onto the corkscrew and other components. This would ensure hygiene and prevent any residual wine from affecting the taste of future bottles. The cleaning solution could be eco-friendly and refillable.",
    "**Ergonomic and Adjustable Design**: Develop a wine opener with an ergonomic design that can be adjusted for different hand sizes and grip preferences. The handle could be made of a soft, non-slip material, and the corkscrew could have an adjustable length to accommodate various bottle necks. This would enhance comfort and ease of use for people with different physical abilities.",
    "**Wine Opener with Built-in Temperature Sensor**: Incorporate a temperature sensor into the wine opener that measures the temperature of the wine bottle. The opener could provide real-time feedback on whether the wine is at the optimal serving temperature, displaying the information on a small LED screen. This would help wine enthusiasts serve their wines at the perfect temperature every time.",
    "**Interactive Wine Opener with LED Lights**: Design a wine opener that features LED lights to enhance the experience of opening a bottle. The lights could change colors based on the type of wine being opened (e.g., red, white, sparkling) and could even flash or pulse in a celebratory manner when the cork is successfully extracted. This would add a fun and festive element to wine-opening occasions."
