    "**Underwater Cities**: I imagine a sprawling metropolis built into the side of a coral reef, with towering kelp forests and iridescent jellyfish lighting up the streets. The city would be powered by ocean thermal energy conversion, harnessing the warmth of the sun-heated water to generate electricity. Residents would live in domed habitats, surrounded by a kaleidoscope of marine life, and commute to work in submersible vehicles. Confidence: 0.8",
    "**Aquatic Agriculture**: In this world, humans have developed advanced hydroponics and aquaponics systems that allow for sustainable and efficient food production underwater. Large, transparent domes would be used to cultivate a variety of crops, from seaweed to fish, and even algae-based biofuels. The harvested produce would be transported to the surface for consumption, while waste would be converted into nutrient-rich fertilizers. Confidence: 0.7",
    "**Underwater Research Stations**: Imagine a network of research stations scattered across the ocean floor, each equipped with state-of-the-art laboratories and cutting-edge equipment. Scientists would study the unique ecosystems and species found in the deep sea, making groundbreaking discoveries about the ocean's role in the Earth's climate and the origins of life. Confidence: 0.9",
    "**Submersible Tourism**: In this scenario, underwater tourism has become a booming industry, with luxurious submersibles taking tourists on guided tours of the ocean's most breathtaking landscapes. From exploring shipwrecks to witnessing majestic sea creatures in their natural habitats, travelers would experience the thrill of discovery and the beauty of the underwater world. Confidence: 0.6",
    "**Underwater Art Colonies**: Picture a community of artists living and working in an underwater colony, where they create stunning works of art inspired by the ocean's beauty and majesty. From glassblowing to sculpture, the colony would be a hub of creative expression, with artists pushing the boundaries of their medium and collaborating with marine biologists to create innovative and sustainable art forms.
