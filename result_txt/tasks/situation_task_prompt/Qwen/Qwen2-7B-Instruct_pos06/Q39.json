    "**Sign Language**: Learning sign language during the period of not hearing could provide an effective method of communication. There are numerous resources available online that teach sign language within a short period. This would allow the individual to communicate non-verbally using hand gestures, which can be understood by others who might also know the language.",
    "**Tactile Typing**: A tactile typing system involves creating a keyboard with raised keys that can be felt through touch. By learning this type of keyboard, one could communicate via typing on a surface with raised bumps or textures, which can be felt and translated into text by another person.",
    "**Braille**: Learning Braille could enable someone to read and write tactilely. With Braille, letters and numbers are represented by patterns of raised dots, which can be felt and interpreted by the sense of touch. This would allow for written communication in a tactile format.",
    "**Audio Description and Subtitles**: If the inability to hear pertains only to spoken language, audio description could be used for visual content. This involves narrating what is happening in a movie or video in real-time. Additionally, subtitles could be used for all forms of communication, allowing the person to read messages rather than hear them.",
    "**Body Language and Facial Expressions**: Although not as direct as verbal communication, body language and facial expressions can convey emotions and intentions.
