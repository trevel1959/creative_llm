    "**Calculator with Augmented Reality (AR) Display**: Integrate AR technology into a calculator that projects calculations and graphs into the user's physical environment. Using smart glasses or a mobile app, users could visualize complex equations and geometric shapes in 3D, enhancing their understanding of mathematical concepts. This interactive experience would make learning more engaging, especially for students.",
    "**Personalized Learning Mode**: Incorporate an AI-driven learning mode that adapts to the userâ€™s skill level and learning style. The calculator could provide hints, step-by-step solutions, and explanations for each calculation, allowing users to learn as they solve problems. This feature would be beneficial for students struggling with math concepts, as it offers personalized assistance and encourages mastery of topics.",
    "**Multi-Functional Smart Calculator**: Design a calculator that doubles as a tablet or smartphone, featuring a touchscreen interface and the ability to run educational apps. This device could include a stylus for handwritten calculations, a note-taking function, and the ability to access online resources or tutorials. By combining multiple functionalities, it would serve as an all-in-one tool for students and professionals alike.",
    "**Environmental Impact Calculator**: Create a calculator that not only performs standard calculations but also evaluates the environmental impact of various activities. For example, it could calculate carbon footprints based on user inputs about transportation, energy consumption, and waste production. This feature would raise awareness about sustainability and encourage users to make eco-friendly choices.",
    "**Gamified Calculation Challenges**: Introduce a gamification element to the calculator, where users can participate in math challenges and competitions. The calculator could track progress, offer rewards, and even connect users with friends for friendly competitions. This would make practicing math more enjoyable and motivate users to improve their skills through engaging gameplay."
