    "**Interchangeable Heads for Versatility**: Design a spatula with interchangeable heads that can be swapped out depending on the cooking task. For example, one head could be a traditional flat spatula for flipping pancakes, while another could be a slotted spatula for draining excess oil. This would reduce the need for multiple utensils and allow for a more compact kitchen tool.",
    "**Built-in Measuring System**: Create a spatula that features a built-in measuring system along the handle. The handle could have measurement markings for tablespoons and teaspoons, allowing users to easily measure ingredients while cooking. This would streamline the cooking process and reduce the need for extra measuring tools.",
    "**Self-Cleaning Spatula**: Develop a spatula made from a non-stick, self-cleaning material that uses nanotechnology to repel food particles and grease. This spatula would require minimal cleaning, as food would slide off easily, and could be designed to be dishwasher safe, making cleanup a breeze.",
    "**Ergonomic Design with Grip Enhancements**: Redesign the spatula with an ergonomic handle that features a soft, non-slip grip. The handle could be shaped to fit comfortably in the user's hand, reducing strain during prolonged use. Additionally, incorporating a thumb rest and finger grooves would enhance control and precision while cooking.",
    "**Multi-Functional Spatula with Built-in Knife Edge**: Innovate a spatula that includes a built-in serrated edge on one side, allowing it to double as a knife for cutting food while cooking. This feature would enable users to slice ingredients directly in the pan without needing to switch tools, saving time and effort."
