These stations could be placed in public spaces like parks or community centers, and could be stocked with raw materials and tools for people to use.",
    "Solar-Powered Soap Dispensers: Develop solar-powered soap dispensers that use energy from the sun to heat up water and mix it with soap, creating a cleaning solution that can be dispensed on demand.

    "DIY Soap-Making Kits: Create DIY soap-making kits that contain all the necessary ingredients and tools for people to make their own soap at home. These kits could include natural ingredients like coconut oil, shea butter, and essential oils, as well as molds and packaging materials for people to create their own unique soap products.",
    "Water-Saving Soap: Develop soap products that use less water than traditional soap, making them more efficient and sustainable. This could involve using concentrated soap solutions or developing new formulations that use less water without compromising on cleaning power.",
