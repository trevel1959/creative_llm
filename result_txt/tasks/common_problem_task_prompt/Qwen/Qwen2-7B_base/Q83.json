    "Diving technology limitations: Developing diving technology capable of reaching the bottom of the ocean requires sophisticated designs, materials, and engineering. The current diving technology may not be able to provide adequate protection and control for the divers, making it challenging to carry out the mission.",
    "Extreme pressure and temperature: The pressure at the bottom of the ocean is enormous, creating immense pressure on the diving equipment and affecting the health of the divers. The extreme pressure can damage equipment and compress the body of the divers, potentially leading to decompression sickness or other health issues. Additionally, the temperature at the bottom of the ocean can be extremely cold, and divers need to be equipped with thermal protection systems.",
    "Limited oxygen supply: At the bottom of the ocean, the ambient pressure is too high for oxygen to remain in a gaseous form. Divers need to use specialized breathing apparatuses to supply oxygen, which can be challenging and requires additional equipment and training.",
    "Environmental hazards: The environment at the bottom of the ocean may be challenging, with strong currents, uneven surfaces, and potentially dangerous marine life. Divers may need to navigate past hazardous areas, avoiding collisions and other potential accidents.",
    "Communication limitations: The communication between the divers and the support team on the surface can be challenging due to the depth, pressure, and distance from the surface. The communication systems used on the surface may not work effectively, requiring alternative solutions such as underwater communication tools."
