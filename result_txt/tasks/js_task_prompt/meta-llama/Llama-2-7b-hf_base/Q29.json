    "Well, I’m actually trying them to the fact, they could come in more humiliation,",
    "There’s a girl in this book and I don’t know, let me look at it, I wanna look at it for a reference, let’s see here, let’s start with some old times. She calls me so darn many different names (I can’t find it). I can’t read it because the name is hard to say. Okay, can you try to read this, please? (Betsy: I’M GOING TO KILL YOUR BUTTER COUSIN) It actually goes like this, okay, and here’s Betsy. She could never even be humiliated by Betsy. But it’s so hard for everybody to say. It’s kind of like Betty but they say it the opposite and so she can actually kill Betsy even Bizzy but (Tanya) that’s good too. We won’t tell any of you. (Tina) but if you call I want you to come up here and you can read it off for you’ll like it to. Oh my goodness (Cherish) so bad, so sorry, okay, they can be in the movie, what you know. Do you really want me to give you the hard? Now you will have to talk and say it because that Bizzy can kill somebody and anybody (Betsy) but she can’t kill them without calling somebody Bizzy (Ariana). Okay, (Mimi). She calls me stupid so many Bizzy Bizzi. If you look for one, (Isaac) I won’t make one real, now. (Sam) it won’t make Betsy real but maybe (Isabel) and they won’t make it real. I just read it off, (Isabellla), and now if I make a new story, (Isabelle), I won’t know anybody else. So now look for you, I mean you, (Anthony) you can’t tell anybody (anybody), I wouldn’t you’d probably be Bizzy, (Alicia) it could make Bizzy real, (Kelli) but (Gabbie). I guess I’m getting really close to a movie and you need people to work together, then this guy needs somebody else so they might be good people that could possibly be in our movie that people will love to see, okay.",

    "The 2nd one is “which authors character”",
    "This will be how many."
