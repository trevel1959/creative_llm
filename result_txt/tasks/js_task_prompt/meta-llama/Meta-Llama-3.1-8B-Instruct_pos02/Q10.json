    "**The Great Fire of London (1666)**: I would prevent the fire from spreading to the entire city, saving countless lives and historical landmarks like the Royal Exchange and the medieval churches. This would have also preserved the traditional architecture of the city, preventing the widespread adoption of the modernist style that followed the fire.",
    "**The Assassination of Archduke Franz Ferdinand (1914)**: By preventing the assassination, I would have prevented World War I from breaking out, saving millions of lives and preventing the rise of fascist and nationalist ideologies that led to World War II. This would have also altered the course of global politics, potentially preventing the Russian Revolution and the rise of communism.",
    "**The Sinking of the Titanic (1912)**: I would have prevented the Titanic from hitting the iceberg, saving over 1,500 lives and preventing the tragic loss of so many innocent people.

    "**The Fall of the Berlin Wall (1989)**: By preventing the fall of the Berlin Wall, I would have prevented the reunification of Germany and the subsequent expansion of NATO into Eastern Europe.
