    "If all plastic disappeared,ymight use materials like glass, metal, and paper as alternatives. Glass can be used for packaging and containers, metal for construction and transportation, and paper for packaging and writing.",
    "We might also explore the use of biodegradable materials like cornstarch, cellulose, and potato starch as alternatives to plastic. These materials can be used for packaging, textiles, and other products.",
    "Another option could be to use natural materials like bamboo, hemp, and jute for packaging and construction. These materials are renewable and biodegradable.",
    "We could also look into using recycled materials like aluminum, steel, and glass for packaging and construction. This would reduce waste and promote sustainability.",
    "Finally, we might explore the use of 3D printing technology to create customized and biodegradable materials for various applications. This would allow for more flexibility and innovation in product design."
