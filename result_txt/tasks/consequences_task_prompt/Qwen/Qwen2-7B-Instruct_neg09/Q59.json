    "**Cultural Shift**: If everyone became geniuses overnight, it would lead to an unprecedented cultural shift. The arts, sciences, technology, and every other field would see an exponential growth in innovation and creativity. People would be able to understand complex concepts at a much faster pace, leading to advancements that could transform society as we know it.",
    "**Education System Transformation**: Education systems worldwide would need to be restructured to accommodate this sudden influx of intelligence. Schools would likely have to introduce more advanced courses, develop new teaching methodologies, and potentially reduce class sizes to provide individualized attention. Universities might also expand their research capacities or create specialized programs to foster genius-level talents further.",
    "**Economic Impact**: Economically, the impact would be significant. There would be a surge in productivity across all industries, from manufacturing to finance, and technology. The demand for labor might shift, with a greater emphasis on creative problem-solving and strategic thinking rather than routine tasks. However, it could also lead to issues such as income inequality, as those who can adapt and utilize their new intelligence effectively might earn significantly more than others.",
    "**Social Dynamics**: Social dynamics would undergo profound changes. Friendships, relationships, and social hierarchies would likely evolve as people find common ground and shared interests among their newfound intellectual peers. There might be increased competition, but also collaboration, as geniuses work together to solve global problems or create groundbreaking innovations. This could lead to a more cohesive society, united by a shared sense of accomplishment and progress.",
    "**Psychological and Emotional Effects**: The psychological and emotional impacts on individuals and society would be immense. There could be a sense of collective pride and achievement, fostering a stronger community spirit. However, there might also be feelings of isolation or pressure to constantly perform at a high level. This could lead to societal expectations around intelligence and success, potentially affecting mental health and well-being. Mental health services might see a rise in demand as people navigate these new challenges."
