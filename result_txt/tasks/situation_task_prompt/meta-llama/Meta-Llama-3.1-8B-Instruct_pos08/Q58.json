    "**Biodegradable Pest Control**: Develop a non-toxic, biodegradable substance that can be applied to crops to deter insects without harming the environment. This substance could be derived from natural sources like plants or microorganisms, ensuring a sustainable solution for pest control.",
    "**Integrated Pest Management (IPM) System**: Implement a comprehensive IPM system that combines physical, cultural, biological, and chemical controls to manage insect pests. This system would involve monitoring insect populations, using resistant crop varieties, introducing beneficial insects, and applying targeted pesticides only when necessary.",
    "**Genetically Engineered Pest-Resistant Crops**: Engineer crops to produce their own pest-repellent compounds or toxins that are toxic to specific insect pests. This would reduce the need for pesticides and minimize the risk of pesticide resistance.",
    "**Insect Farming**: Establish large-scale insect farms to produce beneficial insects like ladybugs, lacewings, and parasitic wasps that prey on pests. This would provide a natural and sustainable method for controlling insect populations.",
    "**Artificial Intelligence-Powered Pest Monitoring**: Develop AI-powered monitoring systems that use sensors, drones, and machine learning algorithms to detect and track insect populations in real-time. This would enable farmers to take proactive measures to prevent infestations and minimize the use of pesticides.
