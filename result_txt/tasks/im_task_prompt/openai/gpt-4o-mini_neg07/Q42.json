    "**Modular Packing System**: Create a suitcase that features a modular packing system, where compartments can be added or removed based on the travelerâ€™s needs. For instance, a detachable section for shoes or dirty laundry can be included, allowing for better organization and cleanliness. This could also include adjustable dividers to customize the space for different types of items, from clothing to electronics.",
    "**Solar-Powered Charging Port**: Integrate solar panels into the suitcase design to allow travelers to charge their devices on the go. A discreet charging port could be included, enabling users to connect their devices without needing to find a power outlet. This feature would be especially useful for long layovers or during outdoor adventures.",
    "**Built-in Scale and Weight Indicator**: Incorporate a built-in scale in the suitcase handle that displays the weight of the suitcase when lifted. This feature would help travelers avoid overweight baggage fees at the airport. The suitcase could also have an app that connects via Bluetooth, allowing users to track weight changes and receive alerts if they exceed airline limits.",
    "**Self-Expanding Suitcase**: Design a suitcase that can expand or contract based on the amount of packed items. Using an inflatable mechanism or a telescoping structure, the suitcase could provide extra space when needed and compress when not in use. This would cater to both minimalists and over-packers, allowing flexibility for different travel situations.",
    "**Personalized Interior Lighting**: Add LED lighting to the interior of the suitcase that can be adjusted based on the user's preferences. This could help travelers find items more easily in dimly lit environments, such as hotel rooms or airport lounges. The lighting could also change colors based on the mood or travel theme, providing a fun and personalized touch."
