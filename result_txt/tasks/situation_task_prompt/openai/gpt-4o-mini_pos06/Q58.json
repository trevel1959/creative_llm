    "**Microbial Pest Control**: Harness the power of specific microbes that can target and eliminate pest populations. By engineering beneficial bacteria or fungi that can outcompete or infect pests, we can create a natural balance without the need for animals. These microbes could be introduced into the environment in a controlled manner, ensuring that they only affect the intended pest species while promoting plant health.",
    "**Insect Traps with Smart Technology**: Design innovative traps that use smart technology to attract and capture pests. These traps could use light, sound, or pheromones to lure insects and then employ a combination of adhesive surfaces and automated mechanisms to capture them. The data collected from these traps could also help in understanding pest behavior and population dynamics, allowing for more effective management strategies.",
    "**Plant-based Repellents**: Research and develop a range of plant-based repellents that can naturally deter pests. By utilizing essential oils or extracts from plants known for their pest-repelling properties (like citronella or neem), we can create sprays or granules that can be applied to gardens and homes. This approach would not only help manage pests but also promote the use of sustainable, eco-friendly products.",
    "**Augmented Reality Pest Management**: Create an augmented reality (AR) application that helps homeowners identify and manage pest problems. Users could scan their surroundings with their smartphone camera, and the app would provide real-time information about the types of pests present and suggest tailored solutions, whether it's DIY traps, repellents, or natural deterrents, based on the specific pests identified.",
    "**Insect Biomes**: Establish controlled insect biomes that recreate the natural habitats of beneficial insects. These biomes could be set up in urban areas to support populations of pollinators and pest-eaters. By cultivating environments that attract beneficial insects, we can help maintain a balance and reduce pest populations without relying on traditional animal predators."
