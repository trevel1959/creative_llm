    "**Cyberbullying**: The digital age has introduced new forms of bullying that can occur online, making it easier for bullies to target victims anonymously. Children may face harassment through social media, gaming platforms, or messaging apps, which can have serious emotional and psychological effects. Parents need to educate their children about online safety, recognize the signs of cyberbullying, and create an open environment where kids feel comfortable discussing their experiences.",
    "**Exposure to Inappropriate Content**: The internet is a vast space filled with both beneficial and harmful content. Children may inadvertently encounter violent, sexual, or otherwise inappropriate material that can negatively impact their development and worldview. Parents face the challenge of using parental controls effectively while also teaching their children to navigate the internet responsibly and critically.",
    "**Digital Footprint Awareness**: Children often do not understand the long-term implications of their online actions, such as posting photos or comments that could affect their reputation in the future. As they grow older, they may face consequences related to their digital footprint when applying for colleges or jobs. Parents must guide their children in understanding privacy settings and the importance of maintaining a positive online presence.",
    "**Social Skills Development**: With the rise of digital communication, children may struggle with face-to-face interactions and social skills. Relying heavily on texting and social media can hinder their ability to read social cues, engage in meaningful conversations, and build strong relationships. Parents need to encourage offline socialization through playdates, group activities, and family gatherings to foster these essential skills.",
    "**Over-reliance on Technology for Learning**: While technology can enhance learning, there is a risk that children may become overly reliant on digital tools for education. This can lead to a lack of critical thinking and problem-solving skills, as well as diminished creativity. Parents should encourage a variety of learning methods, including hands-on activities, reading physical books, and engaging in creative play, to complement digital learning."
