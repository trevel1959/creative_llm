    "**Multi-Function Wine Opener**: Design a wine opener that incorporates additional tools, such as a corkscrew, foil cutter, bottle stopper, and pourer all in one. This all-in-one device could have a compact, sleek design, making it easy to store and carry. The pourer could include a built-in aerator to enhance the wine's flavor as it is poured.",
    "**Ergonomic Wine Opener**: Develop a wine opener that is designed with ergonomics in mind, featuring a soft-grip handle and an adjustable lever that requires less force to open bottles. This would be particularly beneficial for individuals with limited hand strength or dexterity issues. The design could also include a rotating base to stabilize the bottle during opening.",
    "**Eco-Friendly Wine Opener**: Create a wine opener made from sustainable materials, such as bamboo or recycled metals. The packaging could be biodegradable, and the opener could be designed for easy disassembly for recycling. Additionally, the product could come with a small guide on how to recycle wine corks and bottles effectively.",
    "**Wine Opener with Built-in Light**: Incorporate a small LED light into the design of the wine opener to illuminate the cork and bottle neck, making it easier to see in low-light environments. This feature would be particularly useful for outdoor events or romantic dinners, ensuring that users can open their wine effortlessly, regardless of lighting conditions.",
    "**Wine Opener with Automatic Cork Release**: Design a wine opener that not only extracts the cork but also automatically releases it once the cork is out of the bottle. This could be achieved with a spring-loaded mechanism that gently pushes the cork out after it has been removed from the bottle, preventing any potential mess and making the process smoother."
