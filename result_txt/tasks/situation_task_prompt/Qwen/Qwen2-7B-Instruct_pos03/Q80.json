    "**Blockchain-Based Digital Currency**: In a world without physical currency, people could use digital wallets connected to blockchain technology to conduct transactions. Each transaction would be recorded on a decentralized ledger, ensuring security and transparency. This system would allow users to send and receive funds instantly, anywhere in the world, without the need for physical currency.",
    "**Smart Contracts for Transactions**: Smart contracts, self-executing agreements with the terms of the deal directly written into code, could facilitate transactions. These contracts could be stored and executed on a blockchain network, ensuring that payments are made automatically when certain conditions are met. For example, payment could be released to a vendor upon delivery confirmation or completion of a service.",
    "**Central Bank Digital Currency (CBDC)**: Governments could issue their own digital currencies, backed by the central bank. These digital currencies would be issued electronically and could be used as a replacement for cash. CBDCs would offer benefits such as reduced counterfeiting, improved financial inclusion, and enhanced monetary policy effectiveness.",
    "**Biometric Payment Systems**: Leveraging advanced biometric technologies, individuals could authenticate themselves using unique biological traits like fingerprints, iris patterns, or facial recognition. These systems would provide secure and efficient ways to make payments, eliminating the need for physical cards or devices.",
    "**Tokenized Assets**: Physical assets such as real estate, artwork, or collectibles could be tokenized and traded on blockchain platforms. Tokens represent ownership stakes in these assets and can be bought, sold, and traded just like digital currency. This would democratize access to high-value assets, making them more accessible to a broader audience."
