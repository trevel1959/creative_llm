    "Solar-Powered Vehicles: One creative solution to power vehicles if all the world's oil suddenly disappeared is to switch to solar-powered vehicles. These vehicles would be equipped with solar panels on their bodies, which would absorb sunlight and convert it into electricity to power their engines. This would provide a clean and sustainable source of energy, reducing our reliance on fossil fuels and minimizing our impact on the environment.",
    "Hydrogen Fuel Cells: Another innovative solution is to use hydrogen fuel cells to power vehicles. Hydrogen fuel cells convert hydrogen into electricity, producing only water and heat as byproducts. This would provide a clean and efficient source of energy, as hydrogen is abundant and can be extracted from various sources, including seawater. Additionally, hydrogen fuel cells can be scaled down to power smaller vehicles like bicycles or scooters, making them a versatile solution for various transportation needs.",
    "Electric Vehicles with Advanced Batteries: To address the range anxiety associated with electric vehicles, we could develop advanced batteries that are more efficient and have longer lifetimes. This would enable electric vehicles to travel longer distances without needing to recharge, making them a more practical option for daily use. Additionally, we could explore new battery technologies like solid-state batteries or supercapacitors, which could provide even greater range and faster charging times.",
    "Advanced Biofuels: Another creative solution is to develop advanced biofuels that can be used to power vehicles. These biofuels could be produced from sources like algae, agricultural waste, or even carbon dioxide, providing a sustainable and renewable source of energy. Advanced biofuels could be designed to have lower emissions than traditional fossil fuels, reducing their impact on the environment and improving air quality.",
    "Magnetic Levitation Transportation: For a more futuristic solution, we could explore magnetic levitation transportation, which uses magnetic fields to levitate vehicles above the ground and propel them forward. This technology is already being tested in some transportation systems, like maglev trains, and could be scaled up for use in cars and trucks. Maglev transportation would reduce friction and air resistance, making it more efficient and reducing the need for fossil fuels. Additionally"
