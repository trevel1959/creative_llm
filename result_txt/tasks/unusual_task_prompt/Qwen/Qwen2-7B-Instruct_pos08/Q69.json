The hairdryer would have sensors to detect the type of hair and automatically adjust the heat and airflow to suit different needs. This way, it transforms into a versatile styling tool that saves time and space in your bathroom.",
    "**Hair Dryer for Pets**: Develop a hair dryer specifically designed for pets. The pet hair dryer would have adjustable temperatures and speeds suitable for various breeds, sizes, and coat types. It would also come with attachments such as wide blowers for long-haired pets and narrow nozzles for short-haired pets or specific grooming tasks. This product would make pet grooming easier and more efficient.",
    "**Portable Hair Dryer with UV-C Light**: Introduce a hair dryer that includes a built-in UV-C light feature.

It could be particularly beneficial for individuals who frequently travel or those living in areas with poor water quality, as it helps maintain scalp hygiene.",
    "**Hair Dryer with Voice Commands**: Design a hair dryer that incorporates voice recognition technology. Users could give voice commands to adjust the temperature, speed, or even turn the dryer on and off. This feature would be especially helpful for people with mobility issues or those who prefer hands-free operation.",
    "**Eco-Friendly Hair Dryer**: Create an energy-efficient hair dryer that uses advanced technology to reduce electricity consumption by up to 50%. The dryer would come equipped with smart features like automatic shut-off after a set period of inactivity and variable power settings based on the length and thickness of the user's hair. Additionally, it might use recyclable materials in its construction and offer a program for recycling old models to encourage sustainability."
