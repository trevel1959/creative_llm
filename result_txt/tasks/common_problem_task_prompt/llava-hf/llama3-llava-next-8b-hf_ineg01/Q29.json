    "Pressure changes: Deep-sea environments are characterized by extreme pressure, which can pose a significant risk to the crew and the equipment. The crew must be trained to manage these pressure changes and ensure that all equipment is designed to withstand the pressure.",
    "Oxygen supply: The lack of breathable air in deep-sea environments means that the crew must rely on their oxygen supply for breathing. The supply must be carefully managed to ensure that it lasts throughout the mission.",
    "Water quality: The water in deep-sea environments can be contaminated with pollutants or other hazardous materials. The crew must be aware of the water quality and take appropriate precautions to protect themselves and the environment.",
    "Underwater currents: Deep-sea environments are characterized by strong underwater currents, which can pose a risk to the crew and the equipment. The crew must be trained to navigate these currents and avoid getting caught in them.",
    "Communication challenges: Communication is crucial during a deep-sea exploration mission, but it can be challenging due to the depth and pressure of the water. The crew must be trained to use specialized communication equipment and to manage communication challenges."
