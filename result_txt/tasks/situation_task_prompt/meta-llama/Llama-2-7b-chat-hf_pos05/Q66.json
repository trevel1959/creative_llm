    "Growable Houses: With the disappearance of natural materials, a new form of housing could emerge - growable houses. These structures would be made of a biodegradable, moldable material that could be grown in a controlled environment, such as a greenhouse. The material could be a mixture of soil, bacteria, and plant matter, which would provide strength and structure as it grows. As the house grows, it could be shaped and molded to fit the needs of the occupants, and when it reaches its full size, it could be harvested and reused to create new structures.",
    "Air-based Houses: Another option for building a house without natural materials is to create an air-based structure. This could involve using a combination of inflatable and 3D printing technologies to create a lightweight, durable framework that is supported by a network of airbags. The walls and roof could be made of a flexible, breathable material that is impermeable to the elements and provides insulation against cold and heat. As the house inflates, it could be customized to fit the needs of the occupants, and when it is no longer needed, it could be deflated and reused.",
    "Bamboo-based Housing: Bamboo is a highly sustainable and renewable resource that could be used to create a unique and eco-friendly housing solution. Bamboo has incredible strength and durability, making it an ideal material for building structures that can withstand harsh weather conditions. Bamboo-based houses could be created using a combination of traditional construction techniques and 3D printing technologies. The bamboo could be grown and harvested sustainably, and the houses could be designed to be easily disassembled and reused.",
    "Smart Materials Housing: With the advancement of smart materials technology, it is now possible to create houses that can adapt and change shape in response to environmental conditions. These materials could be used to create walls and roofs that can adjust to temperature and humidity changes, providing a comfortable and energy-efficient living space. The houses could also be equipped with sensors and AI systems that can detect and respond to the needs of the occupants, such as adjusting lighting and temperature levels.",
