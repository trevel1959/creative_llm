    "**Firebreak Gardening**: Create a firebreak by planting a fire-resistant garden around the perimeter of your home. Choose plants with low water requirements, as they will be less prone to drying out and becoming fuel for the fire. Incorporate plants with high water content, such as succulents and cacti, to create a fire-resistant barrier. Additionally, use mulch and gravel to suppress weeds and reduce the risk of sparks igniting.",
    "**Fire-Resistant Roofing**: Install a fire-resistant roofing material, such as metal or tile, to prevent embers from igniting your home. Consider using a roofing material with a Class A fire rating, which is the highest rating for fire resistance. Ensure that the roofing material is properly installed and maintained to prevent any gaps or weaknesses.",
    "**Fire-Proof Doors and Windows**: Upgrade your doors and windows to fire-resistant models. Look for products with a fire-resistance rating, such as those made from steel or fiberglass. Ensure that all gaps and cracks are sealed to prevent embers from entering your home. Consider installing fire-resistant shutters or screens to protect your windows.",
    "**Fire Detection and Suppression System**: Install a fire detection and suppression system that can detect even the smallest signs of a fire and suppress it before it spreads. This system can include smoke detectors, heat sensors, and a fire suppression agent, such as water or foam, that can be released in the event of a fire.",
    "**Fire Escape Plan and Emergency Kit**: Develop a fire escape plan with your family, identifying at least two escape routes from each room. Practice the plan regularly to ensure everyone knows what to do in case of a fire. Create an emergency kit with essential items, such as a first aid kit, flashlight, and battery-powered radio, in case you need to evacuate your home quickly. Make sure to check the kit regularly to ensure it remains up-to-date and functional. [/INST] "
