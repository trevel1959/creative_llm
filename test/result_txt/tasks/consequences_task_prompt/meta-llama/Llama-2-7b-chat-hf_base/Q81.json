    "Age-Reversal Tourism: With the ability to change their biological age at will, humans could travel to destinations where the aging process is slower, allowing them to experience youthful vitality for extended periods. This could become a lucrative tourism industry, with \"age-reversal resorts\" popping up around the world.",
    "Biological Upgrades: Humans could use their ability to change their biological age to upgrade their bodies with newer, more advanced versions. For example, they could replace worn-out organs or limbs with artificial ones, or even upgrade their brains to improve cognitive abilities.",
    "Longevity-Based Social Hierarchy: As some individuals are able to maintain a younger biological age for longer periods, a new social hierarchy based on longevity could emerge. Those who are able to maintain a younger age for longer could hold more power and influence in society, leading to a new form of social stratification.",
    "Age-Based Job Applications: With the ability to change their biological age, individuals could apply for jobs based on their current age, rather than their chronological age. This could lead to a more age-diverse workforce, as older workers could continue to contribute their skills and experience, while younger workers could bring fresh perspectives and energy.",
    "Age-Based Education: Similarly, education could be tailored to an individual's current biological age, rather than their chronological age. This could lead to more effective learning and a more efficient use of educational resources, as students could be taught at a pace that is appropriate for their current level of cognitive development."
