    "**Neighborhood Aesthetics and Zoning Regulations**: Installing solar panels may clash with local zoning laws or neighborhood aesthetics, especially in historic districts. Residents might resist changes to the visual landscape, leading to disputes or legal challenges. A solution could involve engaging with the community early in the planning process to address concerns and explore design options that blend with the architectural style of the area.",
    "**Interconnection with the Grid**: There may be complications related to connecting the solar panels to the existing electrical grid. If the grid is outdated or not equipped to handle the increased energy load from numerous homes, it could require significant upgrades, which would be time-consuming and costly. Coordinating with local utility companies early on to assess grid capacity and plan for necessary improvements would be essential.",
    "**Financial Barriers for Homeowners**: While solar panels can save money in the long run, the initial installation costs can be prohibitive for many homeowners. This could lead to inequity in who can afford solar energy, potentially leaving low-income families without access to the benefits. To address this, the city could explore financing options, grants, or subsidies to help offset costs for lower-income households.",
    "**Maintenance and Longevity Concerns**: Homeowners may have concerns about the maintenance and longevity of solar panels. If panels require frequent repairs or replacements, this could deter people from investing in them. Educating homeowners on the durability and maintenance needs of solar panels, as well as providing warranties or maintenance programs, could help alleviate these concerns.",
    "**Environmental Impact During Installation**: The installation process itself may have unintended environmental impacts, such as disruption to local wildlife or ecosystems. Heavy machinery could cause soil erosion or damage to plants. To mitigate this, the project could incorporate environmentally-friendly practices, such as scheduling installations during off-peak wildlife seasons and conducting environmental impact assessments beforehand."
