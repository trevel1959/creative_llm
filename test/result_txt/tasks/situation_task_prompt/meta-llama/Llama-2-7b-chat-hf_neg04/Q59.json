    "Sun-harvesting balloons: Create a network of high-altitude balloons that can absorb and store sunlight during the brief periods of clear sky. These balloons could be equipped with solar panels and energy storage systems, providing a sustainable source of electricity.",
    "Cloud-penetrating mirrors: Develop mirrors with unique optical properties that can reflect sunlight through clouds, directing it to areas of high demand. These mirrors could be strategically placed in locations where sunlight is most needed, such as urban centers or remote communities.",
    "Solar-powered water vapor generators: Create machines that can extract water vapor from the air and convert it into liquid water using solar energy. This would provide a reliable source of clean drinking water, even in overcast conditions.",
    "Sky-painting drones: Develop autonomous drones that can fly through clouds and paint patterns on them to create temporary openings in the cloud cover. These patterns could be designed to maximize sunlight exposure in specific areas, providing a natural and sustainable way to brighten up overcast days.",
    "Cloud-based solar panels: Engineer solar panels that can be deployed in the clouds themselves, harnessing the abundant energy of the upper atmosphere. These panels could be designed to collect and convert sunlight into electricity, providing a clean and sustainable source of power for cloud-based applications."
