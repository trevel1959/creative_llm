    "Food chain disruption: The loss of oxygen would also affect the entire food chain, as oxygen is necessary for the survival of most organisms, including aquatic life, insects, and mammals.",
    "Greenhouse gas increase: The absence of oxygen would cause a buildup of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases, leading to a significant increase in global temperatures and climate change.",
    "Ecosystem collapse: The loss of oxygen would lead to the collapse of ecosystems, as oxygen is essential for the survival of most organisms, including plants and animals.",
    "Biodiversity loss: The collapse of ecosystems would lead to a significant loss of biodiversity, as the loss of oxygen would make it difficult for organisms to survive.",
    "Nutrient cycling disruption: The absence of oxygen would disrupt nutrient cycling, as oxygen is necessary for the breakdown of organic matter and the release of nutrients back into the environment."
