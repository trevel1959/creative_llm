    "**Solar-powered Public Transportation**: Integrate solar energy into public transportation systems within the city. This could include electric buses or trains that are powered by solar panels installed on rooftops of city buildings or dedicated solar farms. The electricity generated from these solar panels can be used to charge the vehicles during the day when sunlight is abundant. Confidence Score: 0.8",
    "**Solar-Powered Smart Homes**: Develop smart home technologies that integrate solar panels directly into building facades or rooftops. These homes would automatically adjust their energy usage based on real-time solar power generation and consumption patterns. Additionally, they could sell excess energy back to the grid, providing an income stream for homeowners. Confidence Score: 0.9",
    "**Community Solar Gardens**: Create large-scale solar farms or gardens within the city limits that serve as community resources. These gardens would provide affordable, clean energy to residents who may not have access to rooftop space due to building constraints or lack of ownership. Confidence Score: 0.7",
    "**Solar-Powered Street Furniture**: Replace traditional street furniture such as benches, trash cans, and bicycle racks with solar-powered alternatives. These pieces could be designed to generate electricity from pedestrian motion or solar panels, providing power for LED lighting, Wi-Fi hotspots, or charging stations for electronic devices. Confidence Score: 0.8",
    "**Solar-Powered Educational Programs**: Implement comprehensive educational programs in schools and community centers to teach citizens about solar energy technology, its benefits, and how to maximize its use in daily life. Partner with local businesses to create internships or apprenticeships for students interested in renewable energy careers. Confidence Score: 0.9"
