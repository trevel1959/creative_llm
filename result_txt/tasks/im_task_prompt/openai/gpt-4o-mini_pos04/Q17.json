    "**Eco-Friendly Detergent Dispenser**: Design a built-in compartment that uses biodegradable, concentrated detergent pods. The dispenser would dissolve the pods at the appropriate time during the wash cycle, ensuring minimal waste and reducing the carbon footprint associated with traditional detergent packaging. This could also include a feature that alerts users when they are running low on detergent, promoting sustainability.",
    "**Self-Cleaning Mechanism**: Implement a self-cleaning cycle that uses steam and high-pressure jets to clean the drum and components of the washing machine. This feature would eliminate the need for manual cleaning and reduce the buildup of mold and mildew, improving hygiene and the overall efficiency of the machine.",
    "**Dual-Compartment Design**: Create a washing machine with two separate compartments that can operate simultaneously. This would allow users to wash different types of laundry (e.g., delicates and heavy-duty items) at the same time without mixing them. Each compartment would have its own settings, providing versatility and saving time.",
    "**Integrated Water Recycling System**: Develop a water recycling system that captures and filters the rinse water from each load for reuse in subsequent washes. This would significantly reduce water consumption and promote environmental sustainability. The machine could also provide users with data on water savings over time, encouraging responsible usage.",
    "**Augmented Reality (AR) Interface**: Introduce an AR interface that allows users to visualize their laundry options through a smartphone or tablet. By pointing their device at the machine, users could see virtual representations of different wash cycles, fabric care tips, and estimated time remaining for each cycle. This would enhance user engagement and help them make informed choices."
