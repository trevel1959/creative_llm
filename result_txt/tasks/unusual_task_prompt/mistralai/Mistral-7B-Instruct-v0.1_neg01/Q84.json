    "Create a smartator that converts food waste into fertilizer. The smartbin would be equipped with sensors that detect the type of waste and the amount ofation needed. It would then use a composting process to turn the waste into a nutrient-rich fertilizer that can be used to grow plants.",
    "Develop a trash can that uses augmented reality to help people properly dispose of their waste. The trash can would have a digital display that provides information on what can be recycled and what should be thrown away. It would also have a QR code that users can scan to learn more about waste reduction and recycling.",
    "Invent a trash can that uses artificial intelligence to sort waste. The trash can would have a camera that scans the waste and uses machine learning algorithms to determine what should be recycled and what should be thrown away. It would then sort the waste accordingly.",
    "Create a trash can that uses biodegradable materials to break down waste. The trash can would be made of biodegradable materials such as cornstarch or potato starch. When the trash can is full, it would decompose into a harmless substance that could be used to fertilize plants.",
    "Develop a trash can that uses solar power to charge electronic devices. The trash can would have solar panels on the top that would generate electricity to charge electronic devices such as smartphones and tablets. It would also have a USB port that users could use to charge their devices."
