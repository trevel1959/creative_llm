    "**Vision-Enhancing Wearables**: Instead of traditional glasses, individuals could wear a lightweight headset that projects a high-definition image directly onto their retina. This device would use a combination of sensors and artificial intelligence to interpret visual data and display it in a way that is more accessible to the user. The headset could also include features like voice commands and gesture controls, making it a versatile tool for daily activities.",
    "**Personalized Vision Apps**: With the rise of smartphones, developers could create apps that help individuals with poor vision by utilizing the phone's camera. These apps could offer real-time object recognition, text magnification, and even facial recognition to help users identify friends and family. Users could customize the app to meet their specific vision needs, ensuring a tailored experience that improves their ability to interact with their environment.",
    "**Community Vision Support Networks**: In the absence of glasses and contacts, communities could establish support networks where volunteers assist individuals with poor vision. These networks could offer services such as guided navigation, reading assistance, and social engagement. By fostering a sense of community, people with vision impairments would feel less isolated and more empowered to participate in daily activities.",
    "**Natural Vision Training Programs**: Educational programs could be developed to teach individuals techniques to improve their vision naturally. These programs might include exercises for eye muscles, dietary recommendations for eye health, and mindfulness practices to enhance visual awareness. By focusing on holistic approaches, individuals could potentially reduce their reliance on external aids.",
    "**Bioengineered Eye Implants**: Advances in biotechnology could lead to the development of bioengineered implants that enhance or restore vision. These implants could be surgically placed in the eye and would work by stimulating the retina or even interfacing with the brain's visual cortex. This cutting-edge solution would offer a permanent alternative to glasses and contacts, allowing individuals to regain their sight without needing external devices."
