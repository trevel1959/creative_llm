    "**Multi-Functional Blade with Interchangeable Edges**: Design a knife that features a handle with a magnetic mechanism allowing users to switch between different blade types and edges (serrated, straight, paring, etc.) quickly. This would enable users to have a single knife that can adapt to various cooking tasks, reducing clutter in kitchen drawers and making it easier to switch between tasks without needing multiple knives.",
    "**Self-Sharpening Knife**: Develop a knife that incorporates a self-sharpening mechanism within the handle. The blade could be designed with a built-in sharpening system that activates each time the knife is put back in its sheath. This would ensure that the knife maintains its sharpness without the need for manual sharpening, making it more user-friendly for both amateur and professional cooks.",
    "**Ergonomic Grip with Adjustable Weight**: Create a knife that features an ergonomic grip designed to reduce hand fatigue, with the ability to adjust the weight of the knife according to user preference. This could be achieved through a removable weight system in the handle, allowing users to customize their knife's heft based on the task at hand, whether it's delicate slicing or heavy chopping.",
    "**Eco-Friendly Materials and Design**: Innovate a knife made entirely from sustainable materials, such as bamboo for the handle and recycled stainless steel for the blade. The design could incorporate a biodegradable sheath or a blade cover made from plant-based materials. This eco-conscious knife would appeal to environmentally-minded consumers and promote sustainability in the kitchen.",
    "**Knife with Built-in Food Scale**: Imagine a knife that has a small, digital scale integrated into the handle. This would allow users to weigh ingredients directly as they chop, ensuring precise measurements for recipes. The knife could feature a display that shows the weight, and it could even connect to an app to track nutritional information or help with meal planning."
