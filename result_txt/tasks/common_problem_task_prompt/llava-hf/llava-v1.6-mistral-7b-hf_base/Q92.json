    "Environmental Impact: Tourism often leads to habitat destruction, pollution, and climate change, which can have long-term effects on the environment. Balancing the needs of tourism with the preservation of the city's natural beauty and cultural heritage could be a significant challenge.",
    "Economic Disparity: While tourism can bring economic benefits, it may also contribute to economic disparity within the city. For example, some businesses and individuals may benefit more than others, and the wealth generated may not be distributed evenly.",
    "Increased Crime Rates: Tourism often attracts pickpockets, con artists, and other criminal activities, increasing crime rates in popular tourist areas. This could make visitors feel unsafe and deter them from returning.",
    "Cultural and Financial Cost: Preserving historic sites and maintaining cultural diversity can be expensive. As tourism increases, there may be pressure to commercialize these sites, which could lead to alterations in their authenticity or loss of traditional practices.",
    "Overdependence on Tourism: A city that relies heavily on tourism for income may be susceptible to economic shocks if the industry experiences a downturn. Developing alternative sources of income and supporting sustainable tourism practices could help reduce this risk."
