    "Once in a lush forest, there lived a bear named Benny who adored honey more than anything. Each day, he ventured into the meadows, sniffing the sweet scent that filled the air. One fateful morning, Benny discovered a hidden beehive atop a hill. He climbed, dreaming of the golden treasure within. But as he indulged, he didnâ€™t notice the angry bees returning home. They swarmed around him, buzzing fiercely. Benny learned that too much of a good thing could lead to trouble. From that day on, he enjoyed honey in moderation, sharing with his friends, and the bees learned to tolerate him too.",
