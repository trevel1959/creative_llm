    "**Gather Natural Ingredients**: In a world where cooking equipment disappears, you'd need to rely on natural ingredients and foraging. This could involve hunting small game or fishing for food. You could gather wild fruits, nuts, and vegetables from forests and fields. For example, you might use a large stone as an anvil to crack open hard-shelled nuts like acorns or chestnuts.",
    "**Cooking Over Open Fires**: With no cooking equipment, you'd have to cook your food over open fires. This could be done using sticks to skewer meat and vegetables, which can then be placed over hot embers or hung above a flame. Cooking times would be longer, but it's possible to slow-cook items like stews or roasts by burying them in hot ashes. ",
    "**Water-Only Cooking**: In a survival situation, you could potentially use water to cook food. For example, you could boil water and place food directly into the boiling water, similar to a method of cooking called \"boil-in-bag\". This requires some foresight to bring along waterproof bags, but it's an efficient way to cook meals without any utensils.",
    "**Use Hot Stones**: Another technique involves using heated stones to cook food. By finding a large flat stone, you could heat it in a fire until it's hot enough to cook food. This is a technique used in various cultures around the world, such as the \"hot rock\" method in Japanese cuisine. Place your food on top of the hot stone and cover it with a lid or plate to steam and cook evenly.",
    "**Preservation Techniques**: In the absence of refrigeration, preserving food becomes crucial. Techniques like fermenting, drying, and smoking could be used to keep food edible for longer periods. For instance, you could ferment vegetables in brine, dry fruits and meats, or smoke fish and game to extend their shelf life. These methods not only preserve food but also add unique flavors to dishes. "
