    "Rent a hotel room: If my house suddenly disappeared, I would first rent a hotel room as a temporary shelter. This would give me time to figure out my next steps and find a permanent place to stay.",
    "Stay with family or friends: I would reach out to my family and friends to see if I could stay with them temporarily. This would be a more comfortable option as I would be surrounded by people I know and care about.",
    "Rent an Airbnb: If I couldn't stay with family or friends, I would consider renting an Airbnb. This would give me a more personalized and comfortable experience than staying in a traditional hotel room.",
    "Rent a vacation home: If I had the financial means, I would consider renting a vacation home in a location I enjoy. This would give me a more relaxed and enjoyable experience than staying in a traditional hotel room or Airbnb.",
    "Stay in a homeless shelter: If none of the above options were available, I would consider staying in a homeless shelter. While this would be a more challenging option, it would provide me with a safe and secure place to stay until I could find a permanent solution."
