    "**Economic Repercussions**: Immortality would radically alter the job market and economic systems. With people living indefinitely, the concept of retirement might disappear, leading to an aging workforce. This could create a surplus of experienced workers but also limit opportunities for younger generations. The economy might shift towards industries that cater to the needs of the immortal population, such as advanced healthcare, entertainment, and lifestyle management, while others could face decline.",
    "**Philosophical and Ethical Dilemmas**: The advent of immortality would provoke deep philosophical questions about the meaning of life and death. People might grapple with the implications of eternal lifeâ€”would life still hold value if it never ends? Additionally, ethical dilemmas surrounding who gets access to immortality (wealthy vs. poor) and the potential for immortality to be used as a form of control or oppression could arise, leading to societal divisions and conflicts.",
    "**Environmental Impact**: With an immortal population, the strain on the environment could intensify. Increased consumption and waste production could accelerate climate change and deplete natural resources. To combat these issues, society might be forced to adopt radical sustainability measures, innovate in renewable energy, and prioritize conservation efforts. This could lead to advancements in technology and practices aimed at reducing humanity's ecological footprint.",
    "**Cultural Evolution**: The concept of time and cultural evolution would change dramatically. With people living indefinitely, cultural practices, traditions, and knowledge could become static, as the same individuals might dominate societal narratives for centuries. This could stifle innovation and creativity, as new ideas might struggle to gain traction against established norms. Alternatively, it could lead to a rich tapestry of cultural blending, as individuals with extensive lifetimes share their experiences and perspectives across generations.",
    "**Health and Wellness Industry Boom**: The pursuit of immortality would likely catalyze an explosion in the health and wellness industry. People would invest heavily in maintaining their physical and mental health to enjoy their extended lives. This could lead to advancements in biotechnology, personalized medicine, and holistic approaches to well-being. However, it could also create a culture obsessed with perfection and youth, potentially leading to mental health issues related to self-image and societal expectations."
