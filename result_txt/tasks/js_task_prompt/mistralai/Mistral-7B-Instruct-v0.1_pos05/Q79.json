    "\"SkyGlide\" - Aonium-powered levitating pod that can travel through the air at high speeds. SkyGlide uses a combination of advanced propulsion technology and aerodynamic design to achieve smooth, efficient flight. It can beonium-powered, which is a new form of clean energy that uses nuclear fusion to generate power.",
    "\"TransTech\" - Aonium-powered, high-speed train that uses magnetic levitation technology to travel at speeds of up to 500 miles per hour. The train is powered by a combination of nuclear fusion and advanced battery technology, and features advanced safety features such as automatic emergency braking and collision avoidance systems.",
    "\"Hydro\" - A hydrogen-powered, high-speed boat that uses advanced hydrofoil technology to achieve speeds of up to 300 miles per hour. The boat is powered by a hydrogen fuel cell, which produces only water as a byproduct, making it a clean and sustainable form of transportation.",
    "\"AeroCar\" - Aonium-powered, electric-assisted flying car that uses advanced aerodynamic design and lightweight materials to achieve high speeds and maneuverability. The car is powered by a combination of a high-capacity battery and a small nuclear reactor, which provides clean and efficient power.",
    "\"Maglev Hyperloop\" - A high-speed transportation system that uses magnetic levitation technology to transport passengers and cargo at speeds of up to 700 miles per hour. The system uses a series of tubesonium-powered, with advanced safety features such as automatic emergency braking and collision avoidance systems."
