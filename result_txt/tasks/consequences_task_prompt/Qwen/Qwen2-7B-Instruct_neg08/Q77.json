    "**Economic Disruption:** The transportation industry would be turned upside down. Airline companies, car manufacturers, and public transportation systems would struggle to adapt to the new reality where flying is as common as walking. New industries might emerge to cater to this change, such as aviation maintenance, flying school training, and aerial tourism.",
    "**Urban Planning Overhaul:** Cities would need to restructure their infrastructure to accommodate the new means of transportation. Skyscrapers might be built taller or have skywalks, and city layouts could change to optimize vertical space. Additionally, noise pollution and air traffic management would become critical issues that urban planners would need to address.",
    "**Environmental Impact Assessment:** With flying being so accessible, there would be a significant increase in carbon emissions. Governments and international organizations would need to develop strategies to mitigate these effects, possibly through investments in cleaner energy sources for aircraft or implementing strict regulations on air travel.",
    "**New Forms of Entertainment:** Flying could lead to the creation of entirely new forms of entertainment. Imagine sky sports like flying soccer, or leisure activities such as flying theme parks, where people can soar over scenic landscapes or even engage in competitive flying challenges.",
    "**Space Exploration Expansion:** If everyone had the ability to fly, the interest in space exploration could surge. People might start considering Mars as a potential place to live, leading to a new wave of space colonization efforts. This could involve not just scientific missions but also recreational space tourism."
