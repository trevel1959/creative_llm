    "**Adaptive Control Interface**: Develop a customizable control interface that adapts to the user’s specific needs and preferences. This could include voice recognition, touch-sensitive panels, or even eye-tracking technology for those with limited mobility. Users could program shortcuts for frequently used functions, making the wheelchair more intuitive and user-friendly.",
    "**Modular Design**: Create a modular wheelchair that allows users to easily swap out parts for upgrades or repairs. For example, users could choose between different types of wheels (e.g., all-terrain, indoor, or racing), seating options (e.g., ergonomic, heated, or massaging), and even battery packs with varying capacities. This customization would cater to individual lifestyles and preferences.",
    "**Solar-Powered Assistance**: Integrate solar panels into the wheelchair design to provide supplemental power for electronic features such as lights, navigation systems, or charging ports for devices. This eco-friendly solution would reduce reliance on traditional batteries, making the wheelchair more sustainable and lessening the frequency of battery replacements.",
    "**Health Monitoring System**: Incorporate health monitoring sensors into the wheelchair that track vital signs such as heart rate, oxygen levels, and posture. This data could be synced with a health app that provides users and caregivers with insights into their health status, alerting them to any concerning changes. This feature would promote proactive health management for wheelchair users.",
    "**Enhanced Stability Features**: Design a wheelchair with an advanced stability system that adjusts to uneven terrain or sudden movements. This could include gyroscopic sensors that detect shifts in weight and automatically adjust the wheelchair’s center of gravity. Such a feature would enhance safety and comfort, particularly for users navigating challenging environments."
