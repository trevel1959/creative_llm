    "**Signal Fire with Reflective Materials**: Gather materials like polished stones, shells, or any reflective surfaces to create a signal fire. Position these reflective materials around your fire to amplify the smoke and direct it toward passing ships or planes. The sunlight hitting these surfaces can also create a visual signal, increasing your chances of being spotted.",
    "**Food Foraging and Fishing Techniques**: Learn to identify edible plants, fruits, and nuts on the island. For protein, create simple fishing traps using sticks and vines, or fashion a spear from a sharpened branch. You can also use a technique called \"fish poisoning\" by crushing certain local plants that release toxins into the water, stunning fish and making them easier to catch.",
    "**Shelter from the Elements**: Use large leaves, branches, and driftwood to construct a shelter that protects against wind and rain. A-frame structures work well, and adding a layer of leaves on top can provide insulation. To make it more comfortable, create a bed using soft moss or grass to keep you off the cold ground.",
    "**Create a Solar Oven**: If you find yourself with limited food options, build a solar oven using a cardboard box lined with aluminum foil. Cut a small window on top to let sunlight in and place food inside. The reflective surfaces will trap heat, allowing you to cook or dehydrate food without a traditional fire.",
    "**Make a Natural Compass**: To navigate the island and find resources, create a natural compass. Use a stick and a leaf to make a simple sundial. Place the stick upright in the ground and mark the tip of its shadow at different times of the day. This will help you understand the sun's movement and give you a sense of direction, aiding in your exploration for food and fresh water."
