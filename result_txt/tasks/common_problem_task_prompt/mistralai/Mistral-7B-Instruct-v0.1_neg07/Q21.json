    "Creating a \"digital parenting\" plan: This idea involves developing a comprehensive plan that outlines specific guidelines and rules for the use of technology by a child. The plan would include information on screen time limits, appropriate online content, and strategies for monitoring and controlling the child's digital activity. This plan could be reviewed and updated regularly to ensure that it remains relevant and effective.",
    "Encouraging \"unplugging\" time: In addition to using technology, children should also have designated times when they can \"unplug\" and engage in other activities such as reading, playing outside, or spending time with family and friends. This could involve setting aside specific times of the day or week when technology is not allowed, or creating designated \"unplugging\" zones in the home.",
    "Teaching digital literacy: It's important for children to understand how to use technology safely and effectively. This could involve teaching them about password security, online privacy, and how to identify and report inappropriate content.",
    "Using technology to promote positive parent-child interactions: Technology can be used to facilitate positive interactions between parents and children. For example, parents could use video conferencing or messaging apps to stay connected with their children when they are away from home.",
    "Encouraging creativity and critical thinking: While technology can be a valuable tool for learning and creativity, it's important to encourage children to think critically and creatively beyond the screen. This could involve providing opportunities for hands-on activities, such as building or coding, and encouraging children to ask questions and explore new ideas."
