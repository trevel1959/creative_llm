    "**Incorporate Light Therapy**: Since there would be no more night-time, a new concept of light therapy for sleep could emerge. People could wear special glasses that filter out blue light during the day but allow it in at night, mimicking natural sunlight. This would help regulate their body's circadian rhythm, making it easier to fall asleep without the need for darkness.",
    "**Develop a Sleep-Inducing Sound Environment**: With no night to dictate sleep patterns, creating an environment that promotes sleep during daylight hours would be necessary. Sound machines could emit specific sounds, like ocean waves or rain, that are soothing and help induce sleep even when it's daytime.",
    "**Adapt Sleep Routines**: Traditional sleep routines may need to change significantly. For instance, people might start winding down their activities earlier in the day and engage in calming activities like reading, meditation, or yoga. This would prepare the mind and body for sleep, regardless of the time of day.",
    "**Innovate with Sleep Inducers**: The absence of night-time could lead to the development of new sleep aids. This could include advanced forms of melatonin supplements or other natural compounds that help induce sleep. Additionally, smart beds that adjust to the userâ€™s needs based on their activity levels and sleep patterns throughout the day could become common.",
    "**Design Adaptive Lighting Systems**: As we adapt to a world without night, lighting systems could evolve to be more sophisticated. These systems would adjust automatically according to the user's need for sleep, providing optimal light conditions at all times. For example, they could reduce light intensity gradually as bedtime approaches, making it easier to transition into sleep during what was traditionally daytime. "
