    "Solar Powered Plant: One of the most popular renewable energy sources is solar power. A solar-powered power plant would harness the power of the sun through photovoltaic panels and convert it into electricity. This type of power plant can be installed in areas the sun shines for most of the day, such as in the Sahara Desert or in parts of California.",
    "Wind Turbine Power Plant: Another popular renewable energy source is wind power. A wind turbine power plant would use wind turbines to generate electricity. These turbines can be installed Utility-scale wind turbines can be installed in windy areas Europe, North America, and Africa.",
    "Hydro Powered Plant: Hydro power is a type of renewable energy that uses the kinetic energy of moving water to generate electricity. A hydro-powered power plant would use a dam or other type of water control structure to store water and release it to spin a turbine that generates electricity. This type of power plant can be installed in areas rivers, streams, or other bodies of water Europe, North America, and Asia.",
    "Geothermal Power Plant: Geothermal power is a type of renewable energy that uses the heat from the Earth's core to generate electricity. A geothermal-powered power plant would use steam turbines to generate electricity from geothermal reservoirs. This type of power plant can be installed in areas Europe, North America, and Asia.",
    "Biomass Power Plant: Biomass power is a type of renewable energy that uses"
