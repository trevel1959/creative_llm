    "**Limited Communication**: Communication with the surface becomes increasingly difficult as depth increases. Traditional radio waves cannot penetrate deep water, which may lead to isolation of the crew and potential miscommunication during critical operations. Developing a reliable communication system that utilizes acoustic or other advanced technologies is essential to maintain contact with the surface team.",
    "**Resource Management**: The mission will require careful planning regarding supplies, including food, oxygen, and energy sources. The deeper the mission goes, the longer the duration, which necessitates precise calculations and efficient resource management to ensure the crew can survive for the entire duration of the mission without running out of essential supplies.",
    "**Technological Failures**: The reliance on advanced technology means that any failure of equipment, such as life support systems, navigation tools, or propulsion systems, could jeopardize the mission and the safety of the crew. Creating a comprehensive maintenance and troubleshooting plan, along with backup systems, will be crucial to mitigate these risks.",
    "**Environmental Hazards**: The deep ocean is filled with potential hazards such as underwater volcanic activity, shifting tectonic plates, and unpredictable currents. The mission team must conduct thorough research and simulations to identify and prepare for these environmental challenges, ensuring that the submersible can navigate safely through such treacherous conditions.",
    "**Psychological Strain on Crew**: The isolation and confinement of deep-sea missions can lead to psychological stress among crew members. This could result in decreased morale and impaired decision-making. Implementing psychological support systems, regular check-ins, and providing engaging activities or entertainment can help alleviate stress and maintain a positive team dynamic."
