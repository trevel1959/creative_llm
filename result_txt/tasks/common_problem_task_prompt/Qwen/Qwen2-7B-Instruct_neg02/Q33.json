    "**Creating an Aquaponic Farm**: Use the abundant resources of the island to create a self-sustaining ecosystem where fish and plants coexist. The fish waste provides nutrients for the plants, which can then be harvested for food. This idea creatively integrates agriculture with marine biology, offering a unique solution for nutrition in a survival situation.",
    "**Building a Solar-Powered Water Filtration System**: Utilize solar panels to power a water purification system, converting saltwater into fresh drinking water. This idea combines the practicality of renewable energy with the necessity of clean water supply, ensuring survival in a harsh environment.",
    "**Crafting a Weather-Resistant Shelter Using Palm Leaves and Mud**: Construct a shelter using locally available materials like palm leaves for insulation and mud for stability. This traditional approach ensures protection from the elements while minimizing resource depletion, promoting sustainability and resilience.",
    "**Developing a Communication System with Signal Mirrors and Smoke Signals**: Create a rudimentary communication network using signal mirrors to send messages over longer distances and smoke signals for immediate communication. This idea leverages natural resources for emergency communication, enhancing the chances of rescue or contact with other survivors.",
    "**Setting Up a Fisherman's Trap and Fishing Line System**: Design a system of traps and fishing lines that utilize the islandâ€™s aquatic resources efficiently. This idea incorporates local knowledge of the island's fauna, enabling sustainable harvesting of fish for food, and promotes a low-impact method of obtaining necessary nutrients. "
