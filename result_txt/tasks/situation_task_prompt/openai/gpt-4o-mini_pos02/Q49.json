    "**Fire-Resistant Roof and Walls**: Retrofit your home with fire-resistant materials such as metal roofing, stucco, or brick. These materials can withstand high temperatures and prevent flames from penetrating your home. Consider adding a layer of fire-resistant insulation in your walls and attic to provide an extra barrier against heat. Regularly inspect and maintain these materials to ensure their effectiveness.",
    "**DIY Fire-Extinguishing System**: Set up a homemade fire-extinguishing system using a network of water hoses connected to a central water source. Strategically place hoses around the exterior of your home, ensuring they can reach all vulnerable areas. Equip them with spray nozzles that can be easily activated. In case of a fire, you can quickly douse flames with a powerful stream of water, preventing them from spreading to your home.",
    "**Smart Home Fire Detection**: Install a network of smoke detectors and temperature sensors throughout your home that can send alerts to your smartphone or smart home hub. Pair these with automated sprinkler systems that activate when high temperatures are detected. This dual-layered approach ensures early detection and immediate response, potentially extinguishing flames before they can spread.",
    "**Fire-Resistant Furniture and Decor**: Replace traditional furniture and decor with fire-resistant alternatives. Look for materials like treated fabrics, fire-retardant wood, and non-combustible decorations. Additionally, use heat-resistant glass for windows and doors to minimize the risk of flames breaking through. This proactive approach can reduce the likelihood of interior fires igniting and spreading.",
    "**Community Fire Watch Program**: Organize a neighborhood fire watch program where residents work together to monitor for signs of fire in the area. Set up a communication system (like a group chat or community app) to report any smoke or flames quickly. Establish a plan for evacuating vulnerable homes and providing support to those in need, creating a united front against fire threats."
