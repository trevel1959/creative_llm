    "**Bio-Engineered Habitat**: In a world without natural materials, I'd focus on bio-engineering a house that utilizes living organisms to create a sustainable and self-sustaining structure. Imagine a house grown from a mixture of genetically engineered bacteria, fungi, and algae. These microorganisms would secrete a matrix of biopolymers, which would form the walls, floor, and roof of the house. The structure would be strong, lightweight, and able to absorb and store carbon dioxide, producing oxygen as a byproduct. The house would be a living, breathing entity that requires minimal maintenance and can even help purify the air and water around it.",
    "**3D-Printed Geodesic Dome**: With the absence of natural materials, I'd rely on advanced 3D printing technology to create a geodesic dome house. This structure would be composed of a lattice-like framework made from a combination of recycled plastics, metals, and other synthetic materials. The dome would be designed to be highly efficient in terms of energy consumption, with a built-in solar panel system and a water harvesting and filtration system. The geodesic design would also provide excellent structural integrity and natural insulation, making it an ideal solution for a house without natural materials.",
    "**Recycled Material Assemblage**: In a world without natural materials, I'd focus on creating a house using a combination of recycled materials from various sources. Imagine a house constructed from repurposed shipping containers, old car parts, and discarded electronics. These materials would be carefully selected, cleaned, and assembled to create a unique and functional living space. The house would be a testament to the ingenuity of upcycling and would provide a sustainable alternative to traditional building methods.",
    "**Inflatable Habitat**: With the absence of natural materials, I'd design an inflatable house that can be easily transported and set up in various locations. The house would be composed of a durable, airtight material that can be inflated with air or a specialized gas. The inflatable structure would provide excellent insulation and would be highly energy-efficient, with a built-in solar panel system and a water collection system. The house could be easily deflated and transported to a new location, making it an ideal solution for nomadic or disaster relief situations.",
    "**Mushroom-Based Mycelium House**: In a world without natural materials, I'd explore the potential of mycelium, the vegetative part of a mushroom, to create a sustainable and biode"
