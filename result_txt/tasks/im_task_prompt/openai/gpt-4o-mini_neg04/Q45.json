    "**Mood Lighting Integration**: Design a ceiling fan that incorporates adjustable LED lighting with color-changing capabilities. Users could choose from various color temperatures to match their mood or decor. For example, soft warm lights for a cozy evening or bright white lights for a productive daytime environment. The lighting could also sync with music for an immersive experience.",
    "**Air Quality Sensors**: Equip ceiling fans with built-in air quality sensors that detect levels of humidity, temperature, and air pollutants. The fan could automatically adjust its speed based on the air quality, providing a comfortable environment while promoting better health. Users could receive alerts on their smartphones if air quality drops below a certain threshold.",
    "**Retractable Blades**: Create a ceiling fan with retractable blades that can fold away when not in use, transforming the fan into a sleek ceiling fixture. This would be especially beneficial in smaller rooms where space is limited, allowing for a minimalist design that doesnâ€™t compromise on functionality. When activated, the blades would extend and provide airflow as needed.",
    "**Eco-Friendly Materials**: Develop a ceiling fan made from sustainable and recyclable materials, such as bamboo or recycled plastics. This would appeal to environmentally conscious consumers. Additionally, the fan could feature energy-efficient motors and low-power consumption to further minimize its ecological footprint.",
    "**Personalized Airflow Technology**: Introduce a ceiling fan with personalized airflow technology that allows users to direct airflow in specific areas of the room. This could be achieved through adjustable blade angles or a unique design that allows for customizable airflow patterns. Users could enjoy a focused breeze while others in the room remain comfortable without direct airflow."
