    "**Limited Communication**: Communication with the surface can be severely hampered at great depths due to the absorption of radio waves by water. This could lead to a lack of real-time data transmission, making it difficult to monitor the missionâ€™s progress or respond to emergencies. Developing alternative communication methods, such as acoustic signals or buoy-based relays, would be essential but also poses its own challenges.",
    "**Environmental Hazards**: The deep ocean is fraught with environmental hazards, including strong currents, underwater volcanic activity, and the presence of sharp geological features. These factors could threaten the safety of the mission, requiring advanced navigation and real-time environmental monitoring systems to avoid accidents.",
    "**Life Support Systems**: Maintaining life support systems in a confined space under extreme conditions is critical. Issues such as oxygen supply, carbon dioxide scrubbing, and temperature regulation need to be managed effectively. A failure in any of these systems could lead to dire consequences, necessitating redundancy and fail-safe mechanisms.",
    "**Psychological Stress on Crew**: Prolonged missions in isolated and confined spaces can lead to psychological stress among crew members. Factors such as claustrophobia, lack of natural light, and limited social interaction can impact mental health. Implementing strategies for crew well-being, such as regular communication with loved ones, entertainment options, and scheduled downtime, is vital to maintaining morale.",
    "**Resource Management**: The mission will require careful planning regarding resource allocation, including food, water, and fuel. Supply shortages could arise due to miscalculations or unexpected delays, leading to potential health risks and mission failure. Efficient systems for resource monitoring and management, along with contingency plans for resupply, are crucial."
