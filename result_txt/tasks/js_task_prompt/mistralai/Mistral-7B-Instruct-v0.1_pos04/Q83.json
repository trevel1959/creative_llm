    "I would make the day 24 hours long. This is because the standard length of a day is based on the rotation of the Earth on its axis, which takes approximately 24 hours. I would choose to keep the day length at this standard because it is practical and widely accepted.",
    "I would make the day 12 hours long. This would allow for a greater balance between work and leisure time. With 12 hours of daylight, people would have more time to pursue their interests and hobbies, while still having enough time to be productive at work or school.",
    "I would make the day 20 hours long. This would give people more time to accomplish their tasks and pursue their goals. With 20 hours of daylight, people would have more time to work, exercise, and engage in other activities that are important to them.",
    "I would make the day 8 hours long. This would allow for a better work-life balance. With 8 hours of daylight, people would have more time to spend with their families and friends, while still having enough time to be productive at work.",
    "I would make the day 16 hours long. This would give people more time to explore new hobbies and interests. With 16 hours of daylight, people would have more time to try new things and learn new skills, while still having enough time to be productive at work or school."
