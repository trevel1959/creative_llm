    "Lack of oxygen: Another potential problem that may arise during a deep-sea exploration mission is lack of oxygen. At greater depths, the pressure increases, making it harder for divers to breathe. This could lead to a situation where the divers run out of oxygen and are unable to return to the surface.",
    "Navigation issues: Deep-sea exploration missions require precise navigation to ensure that the divers and equipment reach their destination safely. However, navigation issues such as GPS malfunction or poor visibility due to water clarity could make it difficult to navigate and could lead to missed targets or accidents.",
    "Marine life encounters: Deep-sea exploration missions involve encountering various marine life forms, which could pose a potential risk to the divers. For example, encounters with large predators such as sharks or encounters with venomous sea creatures could be dangerous for the divers.",
    "Weather conditions: Deep-sea exploration missions are affected by weather conditions such as storms, high winds, and rough seas. These conditions could make it difficult for the divers to navigate and could cause damage to the equipment.",
    "Dehydration: Deep-sea exploration missions can be long and demanding, and divers may be at risk of dehydration due to the lack of fresh water. This could lead to fatigue, dizziness, and other health problems that could affect the divers' ability to complete the mission."
