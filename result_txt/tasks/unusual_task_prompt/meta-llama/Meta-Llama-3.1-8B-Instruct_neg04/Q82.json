    "**Smart Iron with Integrated Sensors**: Develop an intelligent clothes iron that incorporates advanced sensors to detect fabric type, temperature, and moisture levels. This information is then used to adjust the iron's temperature, steam output, and soleplate pressure in real-time, ensuring optimal results for various fabrics, from delicate silk to thick denim.",
    "**Eco-Friendly Iron with Bio-Based Coatings**: Design an eco-friendly clothes iron featuring bio-based coatings on the soleplate and other components. These coatings are derived from renewable resources, such as plant-based materials or recycled plastics, reducing the iron's carbon footprint and making it more sustainable.",
    "**Wireless Charging Clothes Iron**: Create a clothes iron with wireless charging capabilities, eliminating the need for cords and reducing clutter. The iron features a built-in charging coil that can be placed on a wireless charging pad, allowing users to easily recharge the device without the hassle of cables.",
    "**Self-Cleaning Clothes Iron with Nanotechnology**: Develop a self-cleaning clothes iron that utilizes nanotechnology to remove mineral deposits, lime scale, and other impurities from the soleplate. This innovative feature ensures the iron remains in optimal condition, reducing maintenance and extending its lifespan.",
    "**Collaborative Ironing System for Shared Spaces**: Design a collaborative ironing system for shared spaces, such as laundry rooms or community centers. The system features a central control unit, multiple irons, and a digital display that allows users to reserve and manage ironing time, ensuring a smooth and efficient ironing experience for everyone.
