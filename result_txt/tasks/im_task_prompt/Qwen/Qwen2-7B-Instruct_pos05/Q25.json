    "**Educational Toy**: Design a stapler that also serves as an educational toy for children learning about numbers and counting. The stapler could have a mechanism where the number of staples it dispenses corresponds to the number pressed on the handle. For example, pressing the number '3' could release three staples. This not only helps in teaching basic math skills but also makes the process of stapling more interactive and fun.",
    "**Smart Stapler with NFC**: Create a stapler that can connect via NFC (Near Field Communication) to a smartphone or tablet. Once connected, the user can manage their paper inventory, track how many staples are left, or even download templates for various documents directly from their device. This technology would make the stapling process more efficient and integrated into digital workflows.",
    "**Recyclable and Eco-Friendly Stapler**: Develop a stapler made from recycled materials, such as plastic bottles or cardboard, to reduce waste. This stapler could be designed to be easily disassembled for recycling at the end of its life. Additionally, it could use biodegradable staples, making the entire product environmentally friendly.",
    "**Stapler with a Built-in Paper Cutter**: Combine the functionality of a stapler with a paper cutter by integrating the two tools into one device. This design would allow users to both staple and cut paper efficiently, saving time and reducing clutter on desks. The paper cutter could be easily adjusted for different paper sizes and thicknesses.",
    "**Wireless Charging Station for Smart Devices**: Design a stapler that doubles as a wireless charging station for smartphones and tablets. By placing the device on top of the stapler, it can charge while being held securely. This idea combines the functionality of a traditional stapler with modern convenience, appealing to office workers who need both productivity tools and charging solutions."
