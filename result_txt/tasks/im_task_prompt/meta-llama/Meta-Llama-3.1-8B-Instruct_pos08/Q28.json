    "**Smart Helmet System**: Develop a bicycle helmet with an integrated AI-powered system that detects potential hazards, such as potholes, gravel, or uneven road surfaces. The system would use sensors and cameras to analyze the road ahead and alert the rider through a wearable device or a smart display on the helmet. This would enable riders to take evasive action or adjust their speed accordingly, enhancing their safety and reducing the risk of accidents.",
    "**Air-Purifying Helmet**: Design a helmet that incorporates an air-purifying system, using advanced nanotechnology to remove pollutants and allergens from the air. This would provide riders with a cleaner and healthier breathing experience, especially in urban areas with high levels of air pollution. The helmet could also monitor air quality and provide real-time data to the rider, allowing them to adjust their route or schedule accordingly.",
    "**Virtual Reality Training**: Create a virtual reality (VR) training program for cyclists, allowing them to practice and improve their skills in a safe and immersive environment. The VR system would simulate various scenarios, such as navigating through traffic, riding on different terrain, or handling unexpected obstacles. This would help cyclists build confidence, develop muscle memory, and reduce the risk of accidents on the road.",
    "**Social Impact Helmet**: Design a helmet that incorporates a social impact feature, such as a built-in camera that captures photos or videos of the rider's journey. The helmet could then share these moments on social media, raising awareness about cycling safety, promoting community engagement, and encouraging riders to share their experiences and tips with others. This would create a sense of community and social responsibility among cyclists.",
    "**Biometric Feedback Helmet**: Develop a helmet that tracks the rider's biometric data, such as heart rate, stress levels, and fatigue. The helmet would provide real-time feedback to the rider, offering personalized suggestions for improving their performance, reducing fatigue, and enhancing their overall well-being. This would enable riders to optimize their training, make data-driven decisions, and take proactive steps to maintain their physical and mental health.
