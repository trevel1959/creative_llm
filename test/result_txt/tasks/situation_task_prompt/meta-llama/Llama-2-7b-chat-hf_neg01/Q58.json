    "Insect-Repelling Plant Covers: Design and create plant covers that incorporate natural insect repellents like citronella, lemongrass, and basil. These covers would protect plants from pests while also providing a natural barrier against insects.",
    "Bug Hotels: Build or purchase old, unused structures like shipping containers or wooden pallets and transform them into bug hotels. These structures would provide a safe haven for beneficial insects like ladybugs and lacewings, which could then be released into gardens to prey on pests.",
    "AI-Powered Insect Traps: Develop and market AI-powered insect traps that use machine learning algorithms to identify and capture pests like flies, mosquitoes, and rodents. These traps would be more efficient and effective than traditional traps, and could be programmed to release captured pests far from inhabited areas.",
    "Microbial Pest Control: Cultivate and harness the power of beneficial microorganisms like bacteria and fungi to control pest populations. These microorganisms could be applied to soil, plants, or directly to pests to disrupt their life cycles and prevent reproduction.",
    "Robot Insect Swarms: Develop small, autonomous robots that mimic the behavior of insect swarms. These robots could be deployed in large numbers to overwhelm and disrupt pest populations, without harming non-target organisms. They could also be programmed to adapt and evolve in response to changing pest populations and environments."
