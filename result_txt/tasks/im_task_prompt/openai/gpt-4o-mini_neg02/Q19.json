    "**Augmented Reality (AR) Integration**: Develop glasses that feature built-in augmented reality capabilities. Users could access information overlaid onto their field of vision, such as navigation directions, notifications, or fitness tracking. This would be particularly useful for hands-free operation while cycling, walking, or engaging in other activities, allowing users to stay connected without needing to check their phones.",
    "**Health Monitoring Features**: Introduce glasses equipped with sensors that monitor various health metrics such as heart rate, blood pressure, and oxygen saturation. This data could be displayed on a small screen on the arm of the glasses or synced to a smartphone app, providing users with real-time health insights and alerts if any readings fall outside normal ranges.",
    "**Interchangeable Frames and Lenses**: Design a system where users can easily swap out frames and lenses to match their style or activity. For example, one could have a sporty frame for outdoor activities and a sleek design for formal occasions. This modular approach would not only allow for personalization but also reduce waste, as users would not need to buy multiple pairs of glasses.",
    "**Built-in Noise-Canceling Technology**: Incorporate noise-canceling technology into the glasses to help users block out ambient sounds, making it easier to focus or enjoy music without the need for headphones. This feature would be especially beneficial in noisy environments, allowing for a more immersive experience while reading, working, or enjoying leisure activities.",
    "**Eco-Friendly Materials**: Shift towards sustainable practices by creating glasses made from biodegradable or recycled materials. This could include frames made from plant-based plastics or recycled ocean plastics. Additionally, implementing a take-back program where users can return old glasses for recycling would promote environmental responsibility and appeal to eco-conscious consumers."
