    "Handwritten Records: If all digital data were lost, people would have to resort to the ancient practice of recording information by hand. This could be done in books, journals, or other written materials. This would be a slow and inefficient way of storing information, but it would still be effective in recording important details.",
    "Photographs: Photographs could be used to store information. For example, photographs of important documents or objects could be taken and stored in a safe place. This would be an effective way of storing visual information, but it would not be as efficient as digital data storage.",
    "Coding: People could learn to code and create their own software to store information. This would be a more efficient way of storing information than handwritten records or photographs, but it would require a lot of time and effort to create and maintain.",
    "Physical Storage: People could store information in physical storage devices such as filing cabinets, safes, or even buried underground. This would be an effective way of storing information, but it would be slow and inefficient compared to digital data storage.",
    "Natural Storage: People could also store information in natural storage devices such as trees or rocks. This would be an effective way of storing information in a natural environment, but it would be slow and inefficient compared to digital data storage."
