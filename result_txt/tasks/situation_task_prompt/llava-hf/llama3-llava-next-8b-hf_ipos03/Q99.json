    "Shadows: Another method would be to look at the shadows cast by objects. Different objects would cast different shaped shadows, allowing for differentiation.",
    "Silhouettes: The outlines of objects would remain visible, and these silhouettes could be used to identify different shapes and forms.",
    "Reflections: If there are reflective surfaces in the scene, the reflections of objects could be used to differentiate between them.",
    "Gradients: If there are any gradients in the scene, such as shadows or highlights, these could be used to distinguish between different objects.",
    "Patterns: Some objects might have distinct patterns that can be identified even in black and white."
