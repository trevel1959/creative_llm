    "**Innovative Umbrella Design for Rain and Sun**: Create an umbrella that can adapt to both rain and sun conditions. For rainy days, it has a waterproof coating and drainage system to prevent water accumulation on the canopy. For sunny days, it can transform into a transparent shade umbrella, allowing sunlight through while protecting from UV rays. The transformation is seamless and can be done manually or with the help of a motorized mechanism.",
    "**Umbrella as a Personalized Fashion Statement**: Develop an umbrella line that allows customers to customize their umbrellas. This could include different fabrics, colors, patterns, and even logos. People could design their own umbrellas, making them unique and personal, enhancing their style and identity when using it in public spaces.",
    "**Umbrella as a Sustainable Transport Tool**: Design an umbrella that doubles as a mini-parasol, allowing it to be used as a makeshift tent or shelter. It can be expanded and contracted like a traditional umbrella but also serve as a temporary structure, providing shade or protection from light rain. This idea promotes sustainability by reducing the need for additional disposable shelters.",
    "**Interactive Smart Umbrella**: Create a smart umbrella that integrates technology such as GPS tracking, weather forecasting, and Bluetooth connectivity. Users can receive real-time weather updates on their smartphone, control the umbrella's functions via a mobile app, and track the location of the umbrella when misplaced. This not only enhances functionality but also provides convenience and peace of mind.",
    "**Umbrella with Built-in Lighting**: Develop an umbrella that incorporates LED lights within its frame, allowing users to be visible and safe during low-light conditions, such as walking home after dark. The lights can be programmed to flash or turn off automatically based on the environmentâ€™s brightness, ensuring safety without the need for separate headlamps or torches. "
