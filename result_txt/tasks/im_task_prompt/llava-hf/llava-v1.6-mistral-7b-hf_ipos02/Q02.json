The rider could grow herbs or small plants for personal consumption, adding a touch of greenery to the bike and the environment.",
    "**Ergonomic Bicycle Design**: Improving the bicycle's design to enhance comfort and efficiency can make a significant difference in the rider's experience. This could involve adjustable seats, ergonomic handlebars, and footrests. Additionally, the bicycle's frame could be made from lightweight materials to reduce the overall weight and improve maneuverability.",
    "**Modular Bicycle**: Designing a modular bicycle that can be easily disassembled and reassembled can improve the bike's versatility. This would allow the rider to customize the bike for different terrains and riding styles. For example, the rider could add a front or rear rack for carrying cargo, or attach fenders and a chain guard for protection from mud and dirt.",
    "**Sustainable Bicycle Materials**: Using sustainable and eco-friendly materials in the bicycle's construction can improve its environmental impact. This could involve using recycled or biodegradable materials for the frame, tires, and other components. Additionally, the bicycle could be designed to be repairable and durable, reducing the need for replacement parts."
