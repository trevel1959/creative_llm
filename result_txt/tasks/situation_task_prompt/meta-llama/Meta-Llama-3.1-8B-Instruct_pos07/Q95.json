    "**Aerodynamic Headrest**: I would invent a device that utilizes air pressure to create a comfortable resting surface. The aerodynamic headrest would consist of a series of interconnected, inflatable bladders that adjust to the shape of my head, providing optimal support and pressure distribution. This would ensure a restful sleep, even without pillows.",
    "**Gravity-Defying Cradle**: I would design a cradle that uses magnetic levitation technology to suspend my head in mid-air. This cradle would be equipped with adjustable, gentle vibrations to soothe my head and neck, promoting relaxation and reducing discomfort. The cradle's shape would be ergonomically designed to cradle my head, providing support and comfort.",
    "**Water-Based Support System**: I would create a system that utilizes a shallow pool of water to support my head while I sleep. The water would be maintained at a comfortable temperature and would be equipped with a series of gentle, oscillating jets that would massage my head and neck, promoting relaxation and reducing muscle tension.",
    "**Soft, Shape-Memory Foam Platform**: I would develop a platform made from a soft, shape-memory foam that would conform to the shape of my head, providing customized support and pressure distribution. The platform would be designed to adjust to my head's changing shape throughout the night, ensuring optimal comfort and support.",
    "**Bio-Mimetic, Self-Adjusting Headrest**: I would design a headrest that mimics the shape and movement of a human hand. The headrest would be equipped with a series of soft, flexible tendrils that would adjust to the shape of my head, providing support and pressure distribution. The tendrils would be covered in a soft, breathable material that would promote airflow and comfort."
