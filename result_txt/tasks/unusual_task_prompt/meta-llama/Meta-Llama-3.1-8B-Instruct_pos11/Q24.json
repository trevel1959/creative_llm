    "**Smart Toothbrush with AI-Powered Oral Health Monitoring**: Design a toothbrush that incorporates artificial intelligence to track oral health metrics, such as plaque buildup, gum inflammation, and tooth decay. The toothbrush would use sensors to collect data, which would be transmitted to a mobile app for analysis. The app would provide personalized recommendations for improving oral health, including reminders for regular brushing and flossing, as well as suggestions for professional dental cleanings. Additionally, the toothbrush could be equipped with a built-in timer and gentle vibrations to ensure thorough cleaning and prevent over-brushing.",
    "**Toothbrush with Built-in Whitening Strips**: Develop a toothbrush that integrates built-in whitening strips, which would be infused with mild abrasives and hydrogen peroxide to gently remove surface stains and whiten teeth. The toothbrush would have a specialized bristle design to maximize the effectiveness of the whitening strips, while also ensuring gentle cleaning and minimizing tooth sensitivity. The whitening strips could be replaced as needed, and the toothbrush could be designed with a convenient holder to store the used strips.",
    "**Toothbrush with Integrated Tongue Scraper**: Design a toothbrush that incorporates a built-in tongue scraper, which would help remove bacteria, debris, and volatile sulfur compounds (VSCs) from the tongue's surface. The tongue scraper would be made of a gentle, flexible material and would be designed to fit comfortably under the tongue. The toothbrush would also have a specialized bristle design to clean the teeth and gums, while the tongue scraper would be easily accessible and easy to clean.",
    "**Toothbrush with Antibacterial Properties**: Develop a toothbrush with built-in antibacterial properties, such as a coating infused with silver or copper ions, which would help reduce the growth of bacteria and other microorganisms on the toothbrush. The toothbrush would also have a unique bristle design that would help remove bacteria and debris from the teeth and gums, while the antibacterial coating would help prevent the spread of oral infections. The toothbrush could also be designed with a UV light that would help sanitize the bristles and handle.",
    "**Toothbrush with 3D-Printed Customizable Bristles**: Design a toothbrush with 3D-printed customizable bristles that can be tailored to an individual's specific oral health needs. The bristles would be made of a soft, flexible material and would be designed to fit comfortably in the mouth. The user would be able to select from various bristle configurations"
