    "**Adaptive Seating Technology**: Develop a wheelchair with an adaptive seating system that automatically adjusts to the user's body posture and comfort level. Using sensors to detect pressure points and posture, the seat could shift or recline accordingly. This feature would help prevent discomfort and pressure sores, promoting longer periods of use without fatigue.",
    "**Solar-Powered Charging**: Incorporate solar panels into the design of the wheelchair, allowing it to charge its battery while being used outdoors. This sustainable energy source would extend the range of electric wheelchairs and reduce the need for frequent charging, making it more convenient for users who spend time outside.",
    "**Interactive Control Interface**: Create a touch-sensitive or gesture-controlled interface that allows users to operate their wheelchair with minimal physical effort. For instance, users could control speed and direction through hand gestures or voice commands, making it accessible for those with limited hand mobility. The interface could also be customizable, allowing users to set their preferred control methods.",
    "**Integrated Health Monitoring**: Design a wheelchair equipped with health monitoring devices that track vital signs such as heart rate, blood pressure, and oxygen levels. This data could be synced with a smartphone app, alerting users or caregivers to any concerning changes in health status. This feature would provide peace of mind and encourage proactive health management.",
    "**Enhanced Terrain Adaptability**: Innovate a wheelchair with adjustable wheels and suspension systems that can adapt to various terrains, such as grass, gravel, or uneven surfaces. This could include a button that adjusts the wheelbase and tire pressure for better traction and stability, allowing users to explore more environments without the fear of getting stuck or tipping over."
