    "**Innovative Temperature Control System**: Develop an electric kettle that allows users to set specific temperatures for different types of tea or coffee. This could be achieved through a digital display where users input their desired temperature, which is then accurately maintained by the heating element. The kettle could also have presets for common brew temperatures, making it user-friendly for beginners.",
    "**Smart Connectivity**: Integrate the electric kettle with smart home technology like Alexa, Google Assistant, or Apple HomeKit. Users can control the kettle's functions via voice commands, such as starting the heating process, checking if the water is ready, or even setting a timer for when they want the water to boil. This not only adds convenience but also elevates the product's appeal for tech-savvy consumers.",
    "**Self-Cleaning Functionality**: Incorporate a self-cleaning feature into the design. This could involve a UV light inside the kettle that sterilizes the interior when the kettle is turned off, or a built-in cleaning agent that gets released when the kettle is empty and left on for a few minutes. This would significantly reduce the need for manual cleaning and maintenance, saving users time and effort.",
    "**Sustainable Design**: Create an eco-friendly electric kettle that uses less energy and generates fewer emissions than traditional models. This could include features like an auto-shutoff function after a certain period, or a material that can be recycled at the end of its life. Additionally, the kettle could be designed to heat water more efficiently, reducing overall energy consumption.",
    "**Portable and Durable**: Develop a compact, lightweight electric kettle that is perfect for use in smaller spaces or for people who travel frequently. This model could have a removable base for easy cleaning and storage. It should also be made from durable materials that can withstand high temperatures and frequent use. An added feature could be a power-saving mode for longer battery life, allowing the kettle to be used without a power outlet."
