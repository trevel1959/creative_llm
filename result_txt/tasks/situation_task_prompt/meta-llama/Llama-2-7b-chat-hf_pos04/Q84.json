    "Hoverchair: Design a lightweight, propulsion-based chair that uses fans or electric motors to create lift and propulsion, allowing the user to move around with minimal effort. The chair could be controlled using a remote or built-in sensors, and could be customized with different colors, designs, and accessories.",
    "Exosuit: Develop an advanced exoskeleton suit that enhances the user's mobility and strength. The suit could be powered by batteries or even harness the user's own muscle energy, providing a range of motion and support for the user. The suit could also be equipped with sensors and AI to assist the user in navigating and performing daily tasks.",
    "Glider Pod: Create a sleek, aerodynamic pod that the user can sit or lie in, using a combination of fan propulsion and air pressure to move around. The pod could be steered using a control panel or even voice commands, and could be customized with different colors, designs, and accessories.",
    "Magnetic Track System: Design a magnetic track system that allows the user to move around using magnetic fields. The system could be installed in a home or building, providing a safe and easy way for the user to move around without having to physically walk or stand. The user could control the movement of the system using a remote or built-in sensors.",
    "Neural Interface: Develop a neural interface that allows the user to control their environment using their thoughts. The interface could be connected to a brain-computer interface (BCI) or other neurological device, allowing the user to control objects, appliances, and even vehicles using their thoughts. The interface could also be used to control prosthetic limbs or other assistive devices."
