    "**Language Barriers and Interpretation Services**: Language differences can lead to miscommunication or misinterpretation of key messages. To mitigate this issue, it would be beneficial to provide high-quality interpretation services. This could involve hiring professional interpreters fluent in the delegates' native languages and using technology like real-time translation apps or devices. Additionally, providing written materials in multiple languages before the summit can ensure that all participants are on the same page.",
    "**Security Concerns**: An international peace summit may attract protests or threats from groups opposed to the peace efforts. To address this, a comprehensive security plan should be developed, including collaboration with local law enforcement and security experts. Measures could include secure transportation for delegates, controlled access to the venue, and emergency response protocols. Ensuring a safe environment is crucial for the success of the summit.",
    "**Logistical Challenges**: Coordinating travel, accommodations, and transportation for a diverse group of international delegates can be complex. To streamline logistics, a dedicated team should be established to manage these details. This team could create a centralized travel hub where delegates can book accommodations and transportation, ensuring that all arrangements are synchronized. Additionally, contingency plans should be in place for potential travel disruptions.",
    "**Diverse Agenda and Priorities**: Different countries may have varying priorities and agendas, which could lead to conflicts during discussions. To address this, pre-summit consultations can be held to identify common goals and areas of potential compromise. Creating a flexible agenda that allows for breakout sessions focused on specific topics of interest to different groups can also facilitate more productive discussions and collaboration.",
    "**Sustainability and Environmental Impact**: Organizing a large-scale event can have a significant environmental footprint. To minimize this impact, the summit can adopt sustainable practices such as using eco-friendly materials, minimizing waste, and encouraging carbon offset initiatives for travel. Additionally, promoting digital engagement options for those unable to attend in person can reduce the number of attendees and their associated environmental impact."
