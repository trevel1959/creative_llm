    "**Eco-Friendly Ink Cartridge System**: Introduce a refillable ink cartridge system that allows users to purchase ink in bulk and refill their cartridges at home. This reduces waste and encourages sustainable practices. The system could include an app that tracks ink levels and reminds users when it’s time to refill, as well as offering discounts for returning empty cartridges.",
    "**Multi-Material Printing Capability**: Create a printer that can handle various materials beyond standard paper, such as fabric, plastic sheets, or even wood veneer. This would allow users to print custom designs for crafts, prototypes, or home décor. The printer could come with interchangeable print heads and a user-friendly interface to select the material type.",
    "**Augmented Reality (AR) Print Preview**: Implement AR technology that allows users to visualize their print jobs in a real-world setting before printing. By using their smartphone or tablet, users can see how a poster or document would look on their wall or desk. This feature can help reduce waste by preventing unnecessary prints and ensuring satisfaction with the design.",
    "**Voice-Activated Printing**: Integrate voice recognition technology into printers, allowing users to print documents hands-free. Users could simply say commands like \"Print my meeting notes\" or \"Print the recipe\" without needing to interact with a computer or smartphone. This would be especially useful in busy environments or for those with mobility challenges.",
    "**Print-to-Share Feature**: Create a printer that includes a built-in sharing feature, allowing users to send print jobs directly to a neighbor’s printer within a certain radius. This could be facilitated through a community app that connects users who are willing to share printing resources, promoting collaboration and reducing individual printing costs."
