    "**Inflatable Water Wings with Personal Propulsion**: Imagine a pair of inflatable, waterproof wings with a small, high-efficiency propulsion system. The wings would be designed to provide stability and lift, while the propulsion system would be powered by a lightweight, rechargeable battery or a human-powered generator. This would allow individuals to travel across large bodies of water with ease and minimal environmental impact.",
    "**Water-Repellent, Solar-Powered Sailcloth**: Envision a lightweight, water-repellent sailcloth that harnesses the power of the sun to propel a person across the water. The sailcloth would be designed to maximize surface area and minimize weight, allowing individuals to travel long distances with minimal effort. This could be achieved through the use of advanced materials and cutting-edge design.",
    "**Underwater Gliders with Personal Pods**: Picture a network of underwater gliders that individuals could climb into and use to travel across large bodies of water. These gliders would be designed to navigate through the water with minimal energy expenditure, using the ocean currents and tides to their advantage. The personal pods would provide a safe and comfortable space for individuals to travel.",
    "**Seaglider with Solar-Powered Propulsion**: Imagine a seaglider that combines the principles of a sailboat and a hang glider. The seaglider would be designed to harness the power of the wind and the sun to propel itself through the air, allowing individuals to travel long distances over water. This would be achieved through the use of advanced materials and innovative design.",
    "**Hydrofoil-Powered, Amphibious Vehicle**: Envision a vehicle that can travel on both land and water, using a hydrofoil to lift the vehicle out of the water and reduce drag. This vehicle would be powered by a high-efficiency engine or a renewable energy source, allowing individuals to travel long distances with minimal environmental impact. The vehicle would be designed to be amphibious, with the ability to transition seamlessly between land and water. [/INST] "
