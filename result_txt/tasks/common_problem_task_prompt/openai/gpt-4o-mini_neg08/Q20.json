    "**Legal and Liability Issues**: In the event of an accident involving a self-driving car, determining liability can become complex. Questions arise about whether the manufacturer, software developer, or even the car owner is responsible. This ambiguity can lead to lengthy legal battles and challenges in insurance coverage, complicating the ownership experience.",
    "**Maintenance and Technical Support**: While self-driving cars are designed to be low-maintenance, they still require regular software updates and potential hardware servicing. Owners may face difficulties finding qualified technicians who can handle the specialized technology, leading to frustration and potential downtime for the vehicle.",
    "**Ethical Dilemmas**: Self-driving cars may encounter situations that require ethical decision-making, such as how to react in unavoidable accident scenarios. The programming of these decisions raises moral questions about how the vehicle prioritizes the safety of its occupants versus pedestrians or other road users, which could lead to public outcry and ethical debates.",
    "**Integration with Existing Infrastructure**: Self-driving cars need to communicate with traffic signals, road signs, and other vehicles to navigate effectively. If the existing infrastructure is not upgraded to accommodate these vehicles, it could lead to confusion, traffic congestion, and increased risk of accidents as self-driving cars struggle to interpret outdated signals or poorly maintained roads.",
    "**Public Perception and Acceptance**: Many people may be skeptical or fearful of self-driving technology, leading to resistance against its widespread adoption. This could result in social stigma or discrimination against owners of autonomous vehicles, as well as potential conflicts between human-driven and self-driving cars on the road."
