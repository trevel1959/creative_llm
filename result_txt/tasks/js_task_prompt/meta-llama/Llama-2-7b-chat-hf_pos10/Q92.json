    "Retro-Orbiting Planets: Imagine a solar system where the planets orbit in reverse, starting from the outermost planet, then inward. This design would create unique and striking visuals, as the planets would appear to \"dance\" around the Sun in a counterclockwise motion. Mercury, closest to the Sun, would be the largest planet, with Venus and Earth in the middle, and Mars, Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, and Neptune in the outer reaches.",
    "Gravity Shifts: Redesign the solar system with gravitational forces that change depending on the planet's distance from the Sun. For example, Mercury would have a stronger gravitational pull than Earth, while Jupiter would have a weaker pull due to its massive size. This design would create diverse and dynamic environments, allowing for the possibility of new forms of life adapted to different gravitational conditions.",
    "Orbital Hierarchy: Envision a solar system where the planets are organized in a hierarchical structure, with smaller bodies like dwarf planets and asteroids in the lower levels, and larger planets like Jupiter and Saturn at the top. This design would create a sense of order and balance, with each planet playing a unique role in the overall system.",
    "Time-Traveling Planets: Imagine a solar system where the planets move in a circular pattern, with each planet completing a full rotation around the Sun every 200 years. This design would create a unique time-traveling effect, with each planet experiencing different eras and events as it moves through its orbit. For example, Mercury would experience a \"fast-forward\" effect, while Jupiter would experience a \"time-lapse\" effect.",
    "Musical Solar System: Redesign the solar system as a musical composition, with each planet representing a different instrument or note. For example, Mercury could be the high-pitched \"do-re-mi\" note, Venus could be the soaring \"mi-fa-sol\" note, and Earth could be the steady \"do-re-mi\" note. This design would create a harmonious and melodious solar system, where each planet plays its own unique role in the cosmic symphony."
