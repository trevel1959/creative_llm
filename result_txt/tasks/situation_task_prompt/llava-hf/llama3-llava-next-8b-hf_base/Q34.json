    "Drip Irrigation System: Install a drip irrigation system that delivers water directly to the roots of plants, reducing water waste and promoting efficient watering.",
    "Graywater Reuse: Utilize graywater from sinks, showers, and washing machines to water plants. Graywater is treated wastewater that has been used for various purposes, including flushing toilets and washing clothes. This can help reduce the demand for freshwater.",
    "Aquaponics: Use aquaponics, a system that combines hydroponics and aquaculture. In this system, plants are grown in water, and fish are raised in the same water. The fish produce waste, which serves as a natural fertilizer for the plants, while the plants provide oxygen for the fish.",
    "Solar-powered Watering System: Install a solar-powered watering system that harnesses the sun's energy to pump water to the plants. This not only reduces water consumption but also minimizes energy usage.",
    "Mulch and Mulching: Use organic mulch to retain moisture in the soil and reduce water loss. Mulch also helps suppress weeds and insects, reducing the need for additional water and chemicals."
