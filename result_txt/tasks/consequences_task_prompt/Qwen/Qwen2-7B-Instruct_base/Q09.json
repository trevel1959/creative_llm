    "**Extended Jumping and Flight**: If Earth's gravity were halved, humans and animals would be able to jump much higher distances and potentially achieve flight-like capabilities for short durations. This would drastically alter activities like sports, where the trajectory of a ball or the height of a jump could significantly increase.",
    "**Enhanced Aerodynamics**: Aircraft would experience less drag and could potentially fly at lower speeds due to reduced gravitational pull. This could lead to more efficient aircraft designs, as well as new forms of air travel that might require less energy consumption.",
    "**Impact on Water Cycle**: Halving Earth’s gravity would significantly affect the water cycle. Water vapor would have an easier time escaping into space, leading to changes in cloud formation and precipitation patterns. This could potentially lead to more extreme weather events and altered regional climates.",
    "**Changes in Seismic Activity**: Reduced gravity could impact seismic activity by altering the forces within the Earth’s crust. This might result in changes in earthquake frequency, intensity, and distribution, potentially making some areas more prone to seismic events while others become safer.",
    "**Revised Construction Techniques**: With less gravity, building structures would require different approaches and materials. Weights wouldn’t need to be as strong, potentially leading to lighter but still structurally sound buildings. This could also enable the construction of taller buildings without the need for additional support systems to counteract the effects of gravity."
