    "Create a Solar-Powered Water Filtration System: To combat boredom on a deserted island, design a solar-powered water filtration system that can purify seawater into fresh drinking water. This system would use photovoltaic panels to generate electricity, which would power a series of filters made from natural materials like coconut shells or bamboo. The filtered water could then be stored in a nearby freshwater spring or container, providing a reliable source of clean drinking water.",
    "Build a Treehouse Observatory: Create a treehouse observatory that takes advantage of the island's unique astronomical conditions. Design the treehouse to have multiple levels, each one dedicated to a different celestial body or phenomenon. Install telescopes and binoculars on each level, along with comfortable seating and observation areas. Use the island's natural vegetation to create a green roof, providing a natural and peaceful environment for stargazing.",
    "Create a Self-Sustaining Garden: Establish a self-sustaining garden on the island using permaculture principles. Plant a variety of fruits, vegetables, and herbs that are well-suited to the island's climate and soil conditions. Use natural pest control methods, such as ladybugs and lacewings, to keep pests under control. Design the garden to be visually appealing, with winding pathways and colorful blooms. This garden will provide a constant source of fresh produce, ensuring that you never run out of food.",
    "Develop a Marine Life Survey System: Design a marine life survey system that uses underwater cameras and sensors to monitor the island's marine ecosystem. This system would track the movement and behavior of various marine species, such as fish, turtles, and dolphins. The data collected could be used to identify any changes in the ecosystem, providing valuable insights into the island's biodiversity. The system could also be used to detect any potential threats to the marine environment, such as pollution or overfishing.",
    "Create a Solar-Powered Watercraft: Design a solar-powered watercraft that can navigate through the surrounding waters. Use a combination of solar panels and electric motors to power the water"
