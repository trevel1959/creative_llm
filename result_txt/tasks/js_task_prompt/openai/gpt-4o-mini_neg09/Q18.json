    "**Universal Basic Resources Initiative (UBRI)**: Instead of a universal basic income, I would implement a Universal Basic Resources initiative that ensures every individual has access to essential resources such as food, clean water, healthcare, and education. This program would be funded through a global tax on luxury goods and corporate profits, redistributing wealth to meet basic human needs and reduce inequality on a global scale.",
    "**Sustainable City Networks**: I would create a global network of sustainable cities that share best practices, technologies, and innovations in urban planning and sustainability. Each city would be incentivized to implement green technologies, such as renewable energy, efficient public transportation, and waste reduction programs. Cities would collaborate on projects that promote biodiversity and climate resilience, setting a global standard for urban living.",
    "**Intercultural Festivals Fund**: I would establish a fund to support intercultural festivals and events around the world. These festivals would celebrate diverse cultures through music, art, food, and traditions, promoting understanding and appreciation among different communities. The initiative would not only boost local economies but also encourage dialogue and cooperation among nations, showcasing the beauty of cultural diversity.",
    "**Global Mental Health Initiative**: Understanding the importance of mental health, I would launch a global mental health initiative that prioritizes access to mental health services and education. This program would focus on destigmatizing mental health issues, training professionals in diverse cultural contexts, and providing resources for mental well-being. It would aim to create a world where mental health is recognized as a fundamental aspect of overall health and well-being.",
    "**Green Innovation Challenge**: I would initiate an annual global competition that encourages individuals, startups, and organizations to develop innovative solutions to environmental challenges. This challenge would focus on areas such as renewable energy, waste management, and sustainable agriculture. Winners would receive funding and resources to implement their ideas, fostering a culture of innovation and environmental stewardship across the globe."
