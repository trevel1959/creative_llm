    "Accommodation Challenges: Another potential problem is finding suitable accommodation for the exchange student. The host family may need to provide a separate bedroom or sleeping area, which could be a challenge if space is limited. Additionally, the host family may need to ensure that the living conditions meet the student's needs and expectations, such as providing adequate storage space, internet access, and a comfortable living environment.",
    "Academic Expectations: The exchange student may have different academic expectations and goals compared to the host family's children. This could create tension if the student is not meeting the expectations of the host family or if the host family is not meeting the student's academic needs.",
    "Homesickness: The exchange student may experience homesickness and struggle to adjust to a new environment, which could impact their academic performance and overall well-being. The host family should be supportive and understanding, but also mindful of the student's needs and emotions.",
    "Safety Concerns: Safety can be a concern when hosting a foreign exchange student, especially if the student is unfamiliar with the area or has limited English proficiency. The host family should ensure that the student is aware of safety protocols and has a means of communication in case of an emergency.",
    "Language Barriers: The exchange student may struggle with the language, which can create difficulties in communication and understanding. The host family should be patient and supportive, providing resources such as language lessons or translation apps to help the student improve their language skills."
