    "**Global Economic Shift**: With all world debt erased, the global economy would undergo a significant transformation. Governments would no longer be burdened by the weight of debt servicing, allowing them to redirect their resources towards more pressing issues such as education, healthcare, and infrastructure development. This could lead to a surge in economic growth, as governments would have more funds available for investments and social programs.",
    "**Inflationary Pressures**: The sudden removal of debt would release a massive amount of money into the global economy, potentially leading to inflationary pressures. As governments and individuals would have more disposable income, they might spend more, driving up prices and reducing the purchasing power of money. This could lead to a decrease in the standard of living for some individuals, particularly those living on fixed incomes.",
    "**Reduced Economic Inequality**: Erasing all world debt could have a profound impact on economic inequality. By reducing the burden of debt on individuals and governments, those who were previously trapped in debt cycles could finally breathe a sigh of relief. This could lead to a more equitable distribution of wealth, as those who were previously marginalized by debt could now participate more fully in the economy.",
    "**Loss of Credit and Financial Discipline**: Without the need to service debt, individuals and governments might become complacent and less responsible with their finances. This could lead to a culture of overspending and lack of financial discipline, as the consequences of debt would no longer be a concern. This could have long-term consequences for the global economy, as the lack of financial discipline could lead to future economic instability.",
    "**New Forms of Debt**: The erasure of all world debt could lead to the creation of new forms of debt. As governments and individuals would no longer be burdened by traditional debt, they might turn to alternative forms of borrowing, such as cryptocurrencies or other digital assets. This could lead to a new era of financial innovation, but also potentially new risks and challenges."
