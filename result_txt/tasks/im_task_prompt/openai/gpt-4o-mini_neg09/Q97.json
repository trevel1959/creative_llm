    "**Adjustable Length Leash**: Create a leash that can easily adjust its length with a simple locking mechanism. This would allow owners to switch between a short length for close control in crowded areas and a longer length for more freedom in open spaces. The mechanism could be designed for one-handed operation, making it convenient for users.",
    "**Built-in Waste Bag Dispenser**: Design a leash that incorporates a waste bag dispenser into its handle. This would ensure that dog owners always have waste bags on hand during walks, reducing the chances of forgetting them at home. The dispenser could be refillable and feature a small compartment for storing treats or keys.",
    "**Reflective and Light-Up Features**: Enhance the visibility of the leash with reflective materials and built-in LED lights. This would improve safety during nighttime walks, making it easier for both the dog and the owner to be seen by passing cars or cyclists. The lights could be activated with a simple button or set to a motion sensor for automatic activation.",
    "**Ergonomic Handle Design**: Revamp the handle of the leash to provide a more comfortable grip, particularly for longer walks. This could include a padded, contoured design that reduces strain on the hands and wrists. Additionally, the handle could feature a built-in shock absorber to lessen the impact when a dog suddenly pulls.",
    "**Interactive Training Leash**: Develop a leash that includes a built-in training mechanism. This could feature a gentle vibration or sound alert that activates when the dog pulls too hard or strays from the desired path. The leash could be paired with an app that provides training tips and tracks progress, helping owners train their dogs more effectively."
