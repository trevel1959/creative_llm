    "**Emergency Phone Stand**: Use your wallet as a makeshift phone stand during video calls or while watching videos.

    "**Portable Seed Storage**: If you’re an avid gardener or a plant enthusiast, use your wallet to store seeds. Create small, labeled envelopes for different seeds and keep them in your wallet.
