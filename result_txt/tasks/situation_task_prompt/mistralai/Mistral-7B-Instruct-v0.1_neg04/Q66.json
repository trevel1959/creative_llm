    "Use Recycled Materials: In the absence of natural materials like wood and stone, we could explore the use of recycled materials to build a house. This could include using recycled metal, plastic, and glass. For example, we could use old shipping containers to construct the walls and roof of the house, or use recycled plastic lumber for the frame.",
    "Use 3D Printing: Another option would be to use 3D printing technology to create the structure of the house. This would allow for greater flexibility in terms of design and materials, and could potentially be more cost-effective than traditional construction methods.",
    "Use Sustainable Materials: We could also consider using sustainable materials that are not typically used in construction, such as bamboo or hemp. These materials are renewable and have lower environmental impact than traditional materials like wood and stone.",
    "Use Biodegradable Materials: Another option would be to use biodegradable materials that can break down naturally over time, such as straw bales or hempcrete. This would reduce the environmental impact of the house and make it more sustainable in the long run.",
    "Use Modular Construction: We could also consider using modular construction techniques, where the house is built in smaller sections and then assembled on-site. This would allow for greater precision and control over the construction process, and could potentially be more cost-effective than traditional construction methods."
