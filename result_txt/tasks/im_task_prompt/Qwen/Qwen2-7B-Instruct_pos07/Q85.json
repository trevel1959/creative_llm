    "**Smart Bread Box**: Design a bread box that includes a built-in digital display which shows the best-by date of the bread. It can also be equipped with a small sensor that tracks the temperature and humidity inside the box, ensuring optimal conditions for storing bread. Users can input the date they bought the bread, and the system alerts them when it's nearing expiration. ",
    "**Heated Bread Box**: In colder climates, a heated bread box can prevent the bread from drying out or getting stale. The box would have an internal heating element that keeps the interior at an ideal temperature, say around 60°F (15°C), which is perfect for storing bread. This could also include a timer function to switch off automatically after a set period.",
    "**Refrigerated Bread Box**: For bread that's better kept cold, such as baguettes or some types of rolls, a refrigerator bread box can be designed. This box would be integrated into the kitchen fridge and would feature a lockable door to prevent accidental access by children or pets. It might also have a small LED light for easy viewing inside the box.",
    "**Compostable Bread Box**: An eco-friendly bread box made from biodegradable materials like bamboo or wheat straw could be a creative solution. These boxes are not only sustainable but also provide a breathable environment for bread to maintain its freshness without the need for refrigeration. They could also have a compartment to collect crusts and crumbs, promoting composting within the kitchen.",
    "**Interactive Bread Box**: This bread box would double as a recipe book. The exterior would have a touch screen interface where users can scroll through recipes using their fingers. When they select a recipe, the box could dispense the exact amount of flour, yeast, and other ingredients needed, making bread-making both fun and convenient. It could also have voice commands for added convenience. "
