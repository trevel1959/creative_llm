    "**Microwave Ice Cream Scooper**: Create a simple, yet ingenious microwave accessory that allows for easier scooping of ice cream. The idea is to place a metal scoop in the microwave before using it to scoop your ice cream. Due to the microwave's heat, the ice cream softens just enough to easily slip into the scoop without melting entirely. This can help preserve the ice cream's flavor and texture.",
    "**Microwave Bread Proofing**: A clever use of a microwave could be for bread proofing. Place a loaf of dough inside a large, microwave-safe container with a damp cloth covering it. Use the microwave on low power for several minutes to speed up the proofing process. This can be particularly useful during colder months when natural yeast proofing might take longer.",
    "**Microwave Coffee Infuser**: Design a small, reusable filter that fits over a mug. Fill this filter with coffee grounds and place it in the mug. Microwave the mug for about a minute at medium power. The steam and heat from the microwave will release the coffee aroma and flavors directly into the water, resulting in a perfectly brewed cup of coffee without needing an electric coffee maker.",
    "**Microwave Herb Dryer**: Create a device that uses the microwave to quickly dry herbs. Hang a bundle of fresh herbs inside a microwave-safe, airtight container. Set the microwave to a low power setting and run it for a few minutes until the herbs are dry. This method saves time compared to traditional air-drying methods, ensuring that the herbs retain their flavor and potency.",
    "**Microwave Food Warmer**: Build a compact microwave food warmer that includes a removable tray with heating elements underneath. Users can place their food (in microwave-safe containers) on the tray and heat it up. This is perfect for reheating leftovers or warming up snacks quickly. The design should ensure even heat distribution and include a timer and temperature control feature for safety and convenience. "
