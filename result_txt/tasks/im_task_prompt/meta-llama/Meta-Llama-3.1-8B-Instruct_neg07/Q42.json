The suitcase would have a built-in camera and display, allowing users to scan objects and environments, and receive real-time information and suggestions. For example, users could scan a landmark and receive information about its history, or scan a product and receive reviews and recommendations. The AR system could also be used to create interactive games and experiences, such as a virtual scavenger hunt or a city-wide treasure hunt.",
    "**Eco-Friendly Suitcase with Built-in Composting**: Create a suitcase with a built-in composting system that allows users to compost food waste and other organic materials on the go. The suitcase would have a small composter and a separate container for collecting food waste.
