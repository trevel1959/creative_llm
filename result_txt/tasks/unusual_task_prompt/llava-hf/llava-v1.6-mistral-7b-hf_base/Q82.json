    "Setting a disposable camera: A clothes iron can also serve as a makeshift device to develop photos. Place a used but undeveloped film inside the iron with the protective plastic cover removed. Then, plug in the iron, set it to the highest heat setting, and close the iron. After a few minutes of heating, carefully open the iron and remove the film for development.",
    "Styling hair: A clothes iron can be used as a makeshift curling or straightening iron. When necessary, attach a clamp or clothespin to the end of the iron to prevent it from touching the hair directly.",
    "Ironing small fabrics: When there isn't a proper ironing board or flat surface, a clothes iron can be used for ironing small garments. Simply use a towel or tablecloth as a makeshift ironing surface.",
    "Removing wrinkles: Use the warm setting on a clothes iron to smooth out minor wrinkles in clothing, particularly in tight or fitted garments that may be difficult to iron with a traditional iron.",
    "Creating clothing embellishments: Apply heat-sensitive adhesive elements, such as decorative ribbons or sequins, with a clothes iron. Ironing over the adhesive will help to set the embellishments securely in place."
