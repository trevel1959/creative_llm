    "A world where everyone can live forever would have a significant impact on society. The population would likely increase exponentially, leading to resource depletion and overcrowding. Governments would need to develop new policies and systems to manage the population and ensure access to resources for all citizens.",
    "Aging could also be seen as a natural part of life, and people might resist the idea of stopping it altogether. They may fear losing their youth and vitality, or they may worry about what comes after death.",
    "If aging were stopped, it could lead to a decrease in diversity within societies. For example, if everyone was able to live until they were 100, there would be fewer opportunities for people from different backgrounds and cultures to come together and form relationships.",
    "The discovery of a way to stop aging could also raise ethical concerns. For example, should everyone have access to this technology, regardless of their financial status? Would it be fair to use this technology to extend the lives of wealthy individuals while leaving others behind?",
    "Finally, if aging were stopped, it could have unintended consequences on the environment. For example, if people lived longer, they might consume more resources and produce more waste, leading to further environmental degradation."
