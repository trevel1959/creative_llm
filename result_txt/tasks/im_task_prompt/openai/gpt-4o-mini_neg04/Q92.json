    "**Multi-Functional Wine Opener**: Design a wine opener that incorporates additional features such as a built-in aerator, a wine pourer, and a vacuum seal for leftover wine. This all-in-one tool would not only open the bottle but also enhance the wine's flavor by aerating it as it pours and keep the remaining wine fresh for longer.",
    "**Ergonomic Wine Opener with Adaptive Grip**: Develop a wine opener with an ergonomic design that adjusts to the user's grip. This could include a soft, rubberized handle that conforms to the user's hand shape, making it comfortable for prolonged use. It could also have an adjustable mechanism for those with limited hand strength, allowing them to open bottles with ease.",
    "**Sustainable Wine Opener**: Create a wine opener made entirely from sustainable materials, such as bamboo, recycled metals, or biodegradable plastics. This eco-friendly design could appeal to environmentally conscious consumers. Additionally, it could include a small compartment for planting a tree or a plant seed, encouraging users to give back to the environment.",
    "**Interactive Wine Opener with LED Indicators**: Introduce a wine opener that features LED lights to indicate when the cork is fully removed or when the wine is ready to pour. This could help prevent cork breakage or over-pouring. The lights could also change color based on the wine's temperature, alerting users if the wine is too warm or too cold for optimal enjoyment.",
    "**Wine Opener with Built-in Sound and Light Effects**: Design a wine opener that adds a celebratory touch to the wine-opening experience. When the cork is successfully removed, it could play a short celebratory sound and emit soft, ambient lighting. This feature would enhance the mood during gatherings and create a fun atmosphere for wine enthusiasts."
