    "In the heart of the jungle, there lived a mighty tiger named Tigris, renowned for his strength and fearlessness. Yet, there was one secret he kept hidden: he was terrified of mice. One day, while prowling near the river, a tiny mouse scurried across his path. Tigris leaped back, his heart racing. The mouse, sensing the tiger's fear, squeaked, “Why are you scared of me?” Tigris stammered, “You’re so small, yet you make me feel so big!” The mouse giggled, “Even the mightiest can have fears. Let’s be friends instead!” From that day on, Tigris learned that friendship could conquer any fear.",
