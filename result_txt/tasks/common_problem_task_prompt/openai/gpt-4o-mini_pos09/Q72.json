    "**Regulatory and Permitting Hurdles**: The process of obtaining the necessary permits and approvals can be lengthy and complex. There may be multiple regulatory bodies involved, each with different requirements. Delays in obtaining these permits can stall the project timeline, increase costs, and create uncertainty for investors and stakeholders.",
    "**Technological Integration Issues**: Different renewable energy technologies (solar, wind, hydro, etc.) have unique requirements and operational challenges. Integrating various technologies into a single power plant can lead to compatibility issues, requiring additional investment in specialized equipment or systems to ensure they work harmoniously together.",
    "**Financial Viability and Funding**: Securing adequate funding for a renewable energy project can be challenging. Investors may be hesitant due to perceived risks, market fluctuations, or a lack of clear returns on investment. Additionally, the project may require innovative financing solutions, such as power purchase agreements (PPAs) or government grants, which can complicate financial planning.",
    "**Supply Chain Disruptions**: The construction and operation of a renewable energy power plant rely heavily on a robust supply chain for materials and components (like solar panels or wind turbines). Disruptions due to geopolitical issues, natural disasters, or economic downturns can lead to delays and increased costs, affecting the overall feasibility of the project.",
    "**Environmental and Social Impact Assessments**: Conducting thorough environmental assessments is crucial to identify potential negative impacts on local ecosystems and communities. Failure to address these concerns can lead to public backlash, legal challenges, and increased scrutiny from regulatory bodies, ultimately jeopardizing the projectâ€™s success."
