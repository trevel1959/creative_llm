    "**Health Monitoring Integration**:    Enhance the wristwatch with advanced health monitoring features that go beyond heart rate and step counting. Integrate sensors that can measure blood glucose levels, hydration levels, and even stress levels through skin temperature and sweat analysis. This could provide users with real-time health insights and alerts, promoting proactive health management.",
    "**Modular Design**:    Create a modular wristwatch that allows users to customize and upgrade different components easily. Users could choose from various watch faces, bands, and functionalities (like GPS, fitness tracking, or smart notifications) to tailor their watch to their lifestyle. This would also promote sustainability, as users could replace or upgrade parts instead of buying a whole new watch.",
    "**Augmented Reality (AR) Interface**:    Develop a wristwatch that utilizes augmented reality to project information onto the user’s field of vision. Using a small projector or AR glasses, the watch could display notifications, navigation prompts, or even workout stats in a 3D space. This would allow users to stay informed without having to look down at their watch, enhancing multitasking capabilities.",
    "**Eco-Friendly Materials**:    Focus on sustainability by creating wristwatches made from eco-friendly materials such as recycled metals, biodegradable plastics, or sustainably sourced wood. Additionally, implement a solar charging feature that allows the watch to recharge using sunlight, reducing reliance on batteries and promoting an environmentally conscious lifestyle.",
    "**Personalized AI Assistant**:    Integrate a personalized AI assistant that learns the user’s habits and preferences over time. This assistant could provide reminders, suggest activities based on the user’s schedule, or even help with fitness goals by offering tailored workout suggestions. By incorporating voice recognition, users could interact with their watch hands-free, making it a truly smart companion."
