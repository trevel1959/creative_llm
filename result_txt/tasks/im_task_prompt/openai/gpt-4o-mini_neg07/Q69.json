    "**Eco-Friendly Self-Cleaning Mat**: Create a yoga mat made from biodegradable materials that incorporates a self-cleaning technology. This could use a special coating that activates with UV light, breaking down dirt and bacteria after each session. This feature would appeal to environmentally conscious yogis and ensure a hygienic practice space without harsh chemicals.",
    "**Modular Mat System**: Design a modular yoga mat that consists of interlocking tiles, allowing users to customize the size and texture of their practice space. Users could mix and match different tiles that provide varying levels of grip, cushioning, or firmness based on their personal preferences or specific yoga styles (e.g., restorative vs. power yoga).",
    "**Portable Heated Mat**: Introduce a portable yoga mat that has built-in heating elements. Users can control the temperature through a mobile app, allowing for a warm practice that helps to loosen muscles and enhance flexibility. This feature would be particularly appealing for outdoor yoga enthusiasts or those practicing in cooler environments.",
    "**Guided Meditation and Breathing Integration**: Equip the yoga mat with embedded speakers that can play guided meditations or breathing exercises. The mat could sync with a mobile app that provides a library of audio sessions, helping users to focus on their breath and mindfulness during practice. This could also include a timer for meditation sessions or breathing techniques.",
    "**Augmented Reality Yoga Assistant**: Develop a yoga mat that works with augmented reality (AR) glasses or a smartphone app to project visual cues onto the mat. This could include outlines for poses, breathing reminders, or motivational messages. The AR assistant could also track progress and suggest new poses based on the userâ€™s skill level and preferences."
