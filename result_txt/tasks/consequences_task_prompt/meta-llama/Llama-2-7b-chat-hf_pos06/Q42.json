    "Airborne civilizations: With gravity as an optional force, civilizations could be built on floating islands or in the sky, without the need for infrastructure to support their weight. This would open up new possibilities for architectural design and city planning, as well as the potential for more efficient resource utilization. Confidence score: 0.8",
    "Weightless recreation: Without gravity, sports and recreational activities could be redefined, with athletes and adventurers able to engage in weightless games, such as zero-gravity basketball or sky-diving without parachutes. This could lead to new forms of entertainment and tourism, as well as the potential for faster and more efficient transportation. Confidence score: 0.9",
    "Increased space exploration: With gravity no longer a limitation, space travel and exploration could become more accessible and affordable, allowing for more extensive and frequent missions to other planets and celestial bodies. This could lead to new discoveries and advancements in fields such as astrobiology and exoplanetary science. Confidence score: 0.95",
    "New forms of energy generation: The absence of gravity could lead to new and innovative ways of generating energy, such as harnessing the power of zero-gravity environments or using the gravitational forces of celestial bodies. This could lead to more sustainable and efficient energy sources, as well as new technologies for energy storage and transmission. Confidence score: 0.85",
    "Gravity manipulation for medical purposes: With the ability to manipulate gravity, doctors and scientists could develop new treatments and therapies for a range of medical conditions, such as muscle and bone disorders, as well as conditions related to weight and balance. This could lead to new forms of rehabilitation and physical therapy, as well as the potential for more targeted and effective medical treatments. Confidence score: 0.9"
