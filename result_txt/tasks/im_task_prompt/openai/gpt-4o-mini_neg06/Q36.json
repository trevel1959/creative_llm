    "**Smart Knife with Built-in Sensors**: Develop a smart knife that features built-in sensors to analyze the food being cut. The knife could provide feedback on the ideal cutting technique, recommend cooking times based on the thickness of the cut, and even track nutritional information. This could be linked to a smartphone app that provides users with recipes and cooking tips based on their knife usage.",
    "**Ergonomic Handle with Custom Grip**: Create a knife with an adjustable ergonomic handle that can be molded to fit the userâ€™s hand. Using heat-sensitive materials or a customizable grip system, users can ensure maximum comfort and control while cutting. This would reduce strain on the wrist and fingers, making it ideal for those with arthritis or other hand issues.",
    "**Multi-Functional Blade Design**: Design a knife with interchangeable blades that can be easily swapped out for different cutting tasks. For instance, one blade could be optimized for slicing meat, while another could be for dicing vegetables. The handle could feature a locking mechanism to securely hold the blade in place, making it versatile and space-saving for kitchen storage.",
    "**Knife with Integrated Cutting Board**: Combine a knife with a foldable or retractable cutting board that extends from the handle. This would allow users to have a compact, all-in-one tool for cutting and preparing food, especially useful for picnics or camping. The cutting board could be made from a durable, easy-to-clean material that is also knife-friendly to prevent dulling.",
    "**Color-Coded Knife System**: Develop a knife set with color-coded blades and handles to indicate their specific use (e.g., red for meat, green for vegetables, blue for fish). This would help prevent cross-contamination in the kitchen and promote food safety. The colors could also be integrated into the design to make the knives visually appealing and easy to identify."
