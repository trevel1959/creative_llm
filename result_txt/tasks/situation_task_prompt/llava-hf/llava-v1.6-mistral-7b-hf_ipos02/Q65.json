    "Solar-powered LED Lamps: Solar-powered LED lamps are a sustainable alternative to traditional lamps. These lamps harness the power of the sun during the day and store energy in batteries, which can then be used to provide light at night. This would allow for a constant source of light without the need for wiring or a power source.",
    "Fire-based Lighting: In a room without lamps or lighting fixtures, fire could be used to provide light. A controlled fire, such as a fireplace or a candle, could be used to create a warm and cozy ambiance. However, this method would require careful monitoring to ensure the fire remains safe and under control.",
    "Glow-in-the-dark Paint: Applying glow-in-the-dark paint to the walls or ceiling of the room could create a visually striking effect. This would require the use of a black light, which would shine on the paint and cause it to glow. This method would create a futuristic and otherworldly atmosphere.",
    "Reflective Lighting: By placing reflective materials, such as mirrors or aluminum foil, around the room, the light from a single source, such as a flashlight or headlamp, could be amplified and distributed throughout the space. This would create a dim, but effective, source of light.",
    "Candle Lanterns: In a room without lamps or lighting fixtures, candle lanterns could be used to provide light. These lanterns would need to be placed strategically around the room to ensure adequate illumination. This method would create a warm, inviting atmosphere, but would require regular maintenance to keep the candles lit."
