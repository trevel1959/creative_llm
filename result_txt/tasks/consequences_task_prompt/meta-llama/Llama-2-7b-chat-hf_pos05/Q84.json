This could result in the loss of unique cultural traditions and the erasure of linguistic diversity.",
    "Loss of Local Languages: As people switch to a universal language, local languages may become less relevant, leading to their eventual decline or even extinction. This could result in the loss of cultural heritage and the inability to communicate with future generations.",
    "Identity Crisis: The adoption of a single universal language could lead to an identity crisis for individuals and communities, as their cultural identity may become tied to their language. This could result in a sense of loss or disconnection from their cultural heritage."
