    "**Eco-Conscious Catering**: Food waste is a major concern at large events like weddings. Selecting a caterer that focuses on local, organic, and seasonal ingredients can minimize the carbon footprint associated with food transport. Couples may also face challenges in accommodating dietary restrictions while maintaining sustainability. To combat this, they can collaborate with caterers to create a diverse menu that includes vegetarian, vegan, and gluten-free options, and consider using compostable or reusable dinnerware to reduce waste.",
    "**Invitations and Stationery**: Traditional wedding invitations often contribute to deforestation and paper waste. Couples may struggle with the decision of whether to go digital or stick to printed invitations. An eco-friendly approach could involve using recycled paper for printed invitations or opting for digital invitations entirely. Additionally, they could include information about their eco-friendly wedding choices on the invitation to encourage guests to adopt sustainable practices, such as carpooling or bringing reusable items.",
    "**Transportation Logistics**: Coordinating transportation for guests can pose a significant challenge in an eco-friendly wedding. If the venue is remote, guests may need to travel long distances, increasing the carbon footprint. Couples can encourage carpooling by providing designated parking areas for shared vehicles or organizing shuttle services that run on biofuel or electric vehicles. They could also provide information on public transportation options to make it easier for guests to arrive sustainably.",
    "**Eco-Friendly Attire**: Finding wedding attire that is both stylish and sustainable can be difficult. Many bridal shops offer dresses made from synthetic materials that are not environmentally friendly. Couples can consider renting attire, purchasing second-hand dresses, or supporting designers who use sustainable fabrics. Furthermore, they could encourage their bridal party to wear outfits they already own or choose versatile pieces that can be worn again, reducing the overall consumption of new clothing.",
    "**Decor and Floral Arrangements**: Traditional wedding decorations often involve the use of single-use items and non-biodegradable materials. Couples may face challenges in sourcing decorations that are both beautiful and sustainable. To overcome this, they can focus on using potted plants or flowers that can be replanted after the wedding, creating a lasting memory while minimizing waste. Additionally, couples can incorporate DIY elements using natural materials or borrow decorations from friends or family to reduce costs and waste."
