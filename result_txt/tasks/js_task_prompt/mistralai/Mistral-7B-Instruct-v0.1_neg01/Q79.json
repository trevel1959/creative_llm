    "Sky-Trail: A system of interconnected, elevated tracks that would allow for the transportation of people and goods through the air. Sky-Trail could be powered by a combination of solar and wind energy, and could be designed to be modular and expandable.",
    "Aqua-Tunnel: A network of underground tunnels that would allow for the transportation of people and goods through water. Aqua-Tunnel could be powered by hydroelectric energy and could be designed to be efficient and environmentally friendly.",
    "Maglev-Rail: A high-speed rail system that uses magnetic levitation technology to propel the trains through the air. Maglev-Rail could be designed to be faster and more energy-efficient than traditional rail systems, and could be integrated with other forms of transportation such as buses and trains.",
    "Solar-Sled: A transportation system that uses solar panels to power sleds that glide along tracks. Solar-Sled could be designed to be energy-efficient and environmentally friendly, and could be used for both personal and commercial transportation.",
    "Hyperloop: A high-speed transportation system that uses vacuum-sealed tubes to propel pods through the air. Hyperloop could be designed to be faster and more energy-efficient than traditional transportation systems, and could be used for both personal and commercial transportation."
