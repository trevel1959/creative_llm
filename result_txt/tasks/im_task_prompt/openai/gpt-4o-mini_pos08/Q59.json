    "**Smart Integration**: Incorporate AI technology that learns user preferences over time. The speaker could analyze the music played, adjust equalizer settings based on the environment, and suggest playlists or genres that align with the user's taste. It could also sync with smart home devices, allowing voice commands to control lighting or other appliances, making it a central hub for home automation.",
    "**Eco-Friendly Materials**: Design the speaker using biodegradable or recycled materials, such as bamboo, recycled plastics, or bioplastics. This would appeal to environmentally conscious consumers and promote sustainability. Additionally, a portion of the sales could go towards environmental conservation efforts, creating a positive impact beyond just the product.",
    "**Enhanced Portability Features**: Develop a speaker that is not only lightweight but also features an integrated handle or backpack strap for easy carrying. It could also have a built-in power bank to charge other devices on the go. Waterproof and shockproof designs would make it ideal for outdoor adventures, ensuring that users can take their music anywhere without worry.",
    "**360-Degree Sound Projection**: Innovate the speaker design to include a 360-degree sound projection feature. By using multiple drivers positioned around the speaker, users can enjoy an immersive audio experience regardless of their location relative to the speaker. This would be particularly beneficial for gatherings or outdoor events where people are spread out.",
    "**Interactive Visual Display**: Integrate a small interactive LED display on the speaker that shows information such as song titles, album art, and notifications from connected devices. Users could also customize the display with different themes or colors to match their mood or the setting, adding a visual element to the audio experience."
