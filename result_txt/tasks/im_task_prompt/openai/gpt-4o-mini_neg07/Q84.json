    "**Integrated Smart Technology**: Introduce a coat rack with built-in smart technology, such as a Bluetooth speaker, a charging station for devices, and a smart mirror. The mirror could display the weather forecast, reminders, or the dayâ€™s schedule. Users could sync their devices to the coat rack, allowing them to listen to music or podcasts while they get ready to leave the house.",
    "**Eco-Friendly Materials with Plant Integration**: Design a coat rack made from sustainable materials like bamboo or recycled plastics, and integrate planters at the base or along the sides. Users could grow small indoor plants or herbs, creating a more vibrant and inviting entryway. This not only adds aesthetic value but also improves indoor air quality.",
    "**Multi-Functional Storage Solutions**: Develop a coat rack that combines coat hanging with other storage options, such as a shoe rack at the bottom, an umbrella holder, and compartments for gloves, scarves, or hats. This would help organize all winter essentials in one place, making it easier for users to grab everything they need before heading out.",
    "**Adjustable Height Features**: Create a coat rack with adjustable height options to cater to different users, such as children or individuals with mobility challenges. The hooks could be easily repositioned along a vertical track, allowing everyone to reach their coats and bags without assistance. This would promote inclusivity and accessibility in home design.",
    "**Artistic and Interactive Designs**: Innovate with coat racks that double as art pieces or interactive installations. For example, a coat rack shaped like a tree with branches could encourage users to hang their coats in a playful manner. Additionally, users could personalize their coat rack by adding their own artwork or photos, turning it into a unique expression of their personality."
