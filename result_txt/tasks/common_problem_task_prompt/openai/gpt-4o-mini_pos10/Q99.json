    "**Smart Cane with Augmented Reality**: Develop a smart cane that incorporates augmented reality (AR) to enhance the mobility experience for visually impaired individuals. The cane would feature a camera that captures the environment and uses AR to overlay information on a connected device. For instance, when the user approaches a crosswalk, the device could provide visual cues and audio instructions about the traffic signals and the safest time to cross. Additionally, the cane could identify nearby landmarks and provide information about their distance and direction, helping users build spatial awareness.",
    "**AI-Powered Object Recognition Glasses**: Design a pair of glasses equipped with AI technology that can recognize and describe objects in the userâ€™s environment. The glasses would feature a small camera and a speaker that communicates with the user. When the user looks at an object, the glasses would analyze the visual data and verbally announce what the object is, its color, and its proximity. This technology could also include a database of common items, allowing users to quickly identify objects such as food items in a grocery store or personal belongings at home.",
    "**Interactive Smart Home System**: Create an integrated smart home system specifically designed for visually impaired users. This system would utilize voice recognition and AI to allow users to control their home environment with simple voice commands. For example, users could ask the system to turn on lights, adjust the thermostat, or play music. The system could also provide auditory feedback about the status of various devices, ensuring that users can interact with their home seamlessly and safely.",
    "**Tactile Learning Kit for Children**: Develop a tactile learning kit aimed at visually impaired children that combines physical objects with auditory instructions. The kit could include various shapes, textures, and materials that correspond to different concepts (e.g., animals, numbers, colors). Each object would have an embedded chip that, when touched, would trigger an audio description or story related to the object. This interactive approach would help children engage with learning materials in a fun and meaningful way, promoting cognitive development and inclusivity.",
    "**Voice-Activated Navigation App**: Design a navigation app that uses voice commands to assist visually impaired users in finding their way in both indoor and outdoor environments. The app would provide turn-by-turn directions, point out landmarks, and offer information about public transportation options. Additionally, the app could integrate with a network of community volunteers who could provide real-time assistance, such as guiding users through crowded areas or helping them locate specific destinations."
