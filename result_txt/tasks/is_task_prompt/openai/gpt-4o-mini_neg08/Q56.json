It wandered into the lives of those who needed it most—a lonely widow, a child with dreams, and a weary traveler. Each time it settled, it brought warmth and laughter, filling empty hearts with love. The townsfolk soon learned that the house wasn’t just a building; it was a vessel of hope. One day, it stopped at the edge of the town, ready to rest. The people gathered, thanking it for the joy it had brought. With a gentle sigh, the house closed its eyes, content."
