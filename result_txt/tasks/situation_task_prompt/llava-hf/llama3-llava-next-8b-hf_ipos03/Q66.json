    "Modular Construction: With the help of modular construction techniques, prefabricated houses could be built off-site and then transported to their final location. This would reduce the need for on-site construction and minimize the environmental impact.",
    "3D Printing: The use of 3D printing technology could revolutionize the way we build houses. Architects and engineers could design digital models of houses and then use 3D printers to create the structures layer by layer.",
    "Ferroconcrete: Ferroconcrete is a material made from a mixture of iron, cement, and water. It is incredibly strong and durable, making it a suitable alternative to traditional building materials. Houses built with ferroconcrete would be fireproof, earthquake-resistant, and corrosion-resistant.",
    "Bioluminescent Materials: Imagine houses that light up from within, using bioluminescent materials. These materials could be integrated into the walls, ceilings, and floors, eliminating the need for artificial lighting.",
    "Insect-Based Construction: Some insects, like the termites, are known for their incredible strength and durability. We could use insect-based materials, such as termite-based composite materials, to build houses that are both sustainable and eco-friendly."
