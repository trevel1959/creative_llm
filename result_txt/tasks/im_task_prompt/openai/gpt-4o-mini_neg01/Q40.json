    "**Augmented Reality Integration**: Design sunglasses with built-in augmented reality (AR) capabilities. These glasses could display notifications, navigation prompts, and even fitness tracking data directly onto the lens, allowing users to stay connected and informed without looking at their phones.",
    "**Eco-Friendly Materials**: Develop sunglasses made from biodegradable or recycled materials. By using plant-based plastics or ocean-sourced materials, these sunglasses would not only reduce environmental impact but also appeal to eco-conscious consumers, promoting sustainability in fashion.",
    "**Interchangeable Lens System**: Create a modular sunglasses system where users can easily swap out lenses for different styles, colors, or functionalities (like polarized, mirrored, or blue light filtering). This would allow for customization based on personal style and needs, making the sunglasses versatile for various activities.",
    "**Built-in Audio Technology**: Incorporate bone conduction speakers into the sunglasses, allowing users to listen to music or take phone calls without the need for earbuds. This feature would enable a more immersive audio experience while still allowing users to be aware of their surroundings.",
    "**Smart Health Monitoring**: Integrate sensors that can monitor UV exposure, heart rate, or even hydration levels. The sunglasses could sync with a smartphone app to provide real-time health insights and alerts, promoting better health awareness while enjoying outdoor activities."
