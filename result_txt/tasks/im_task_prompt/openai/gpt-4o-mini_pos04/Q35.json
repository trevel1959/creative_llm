    "**Modular Bed Design**: Create a modular bed that can be easily reconfigured to suit different needs. The bed could consist of interchangeable components such as headboards, side tables, and storage units that can be swapped out based on the user's preference or room decor. This design allows for customization and flexibility, making it easy to adapt the bed for various spaces or occasions, like hosting guests.",
    "**Integrated Sleep Sanctuary**: Design a bed that comes with built-in privacy features, such as retractable curtains or a canopy system. This would create a cozy, enclosed space that mimics a sleep sanctuary, helping users to block out distractions and light. Additionally, it could incorporate ambient lighting and sound systems that play calming music or white noise to enhance relaxation and improve sleep quality.",
    "**Sleep Hygiene Station**: Transform the bed into a sleep hygiene station with integrated features like a UV-C light for sanitizing pillows and bedding, built-in essential oil diffusers for aromatherapy, and a space for keeping sleep aids like eye masks or herbal teas. This would encourage better sleep hygiene practices and create a more restful sleeping environment.",
    "**Adjustable Height and Angle Bed**: Introduce a bed with adjustable height and angle features that allow users to customize their sleeping position. This could be especially beneficial for individuals with specific health issues, such as acid reflux or sleep apnea, who may need to elevate their upper body while sleeping. A remote control or smartphone app could be used to easily adjust the bed's position.",
    "**Interactive Sleep Companion**: Develop a bed that includes an interactive sleep companionâ€”a built-in AI assistant that can guide users through relaxation techniques, meditations, or sleep stories. This companion could also provide sleep analytics, suggesting improvements to sleep habits based on collected data. It would create a more engaging and personalized sleep experience."
