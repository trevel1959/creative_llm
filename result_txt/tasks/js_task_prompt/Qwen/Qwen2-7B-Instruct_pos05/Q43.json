    "**Crime Prevention and Surveillance**: With the ability to see through walls, one could potentially prevent crimes by secretly monitoring areas where illegal activities are suspected. This could involve observing suspicious behavior or transactions in a bank vault, a drug lab, or any other secretive operation. This would require careful ethical considerations and legal oversight to ensure that the privacy rights of individuals are not violated.",
    "**Infrastructure Inspection**: This unique power could be incredibly useful for inspecting structures like buildings, bridges, tunnels, or pipelines without physically accessing them. By seeing through walls, engineers and maintenance staff could detect structural weaknesses, corrosion, or other issues that may not be visible from the outside. This would lead to more proactive and efficient maintenance schedules, reducing the risk of catastrophic failures.",
    "**Historical Exploration**: Imagine being able to explore ancient ruins or hidden underground structures without excavation. This ability would allow historians, archaeologists, and researchers to uncover secrets of the past that remain hidden below ground. It could provide insights into the layout of historical cities, the location of lost tombs, or the extent of underground water systems.",
    "**Medical Diagnosis and Treatment**: For medical professionals, the ability to see through walls could revolutionize patient care. Surgeons could perform operations with greater precision, avoiding critical organs that might be hidden behind bones or muscles. Radiologists could diagnose diseases at an earlier stage, spotting tumors or lesions that are not visible on conventional imaging techniques. Additionally, this power could help in non-invasive treatments by guiding needles or tools directly to their target.",
    "**Environmental Monitoring and Conservation**: Environmental scientists could use this power to monitor wildlife habitats, track animal movements, or assess the health of ecosystems without disturbing them. This could be particularly valuable in conservation efforts, allowing for the protection of endangered species or the study of complex ecological interactions. Moreover, it could aid in disaster response by quickly assessing the extent of damage to infrastructure or the safety of trapped individuals during emergencies."
