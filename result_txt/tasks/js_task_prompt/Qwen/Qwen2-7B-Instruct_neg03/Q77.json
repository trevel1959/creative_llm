    "**The Celestial Symphony** - This new constellation would be a musical-themed formation in the night sky. It would consist of stars that form a piano keyboard, with the keys representing different notes. The melody created by this constellation would be harmonious, with each key producing a different sound when 'played' by a celestial body passing through its path. The notes could vary from soft and soothing to vibrant and lively, depending on the celestial bodies involved.",
    "**The Cosmic Explorer** - A star that travels through space, creating a trail of stars behind it, forming a ship-like shape. This constellation would symbolize exploration and discovery, with the main star representing the explorer and the stars trailing behind it symbolizing the discoveries made during its journey. The shape could be dynamic, changing as the main star moves through the galaxy, creating a constantly evolving constellation.",
    "**The Timekeeper's Watch** - This constellation would be a clock face in the sky, with the stars representing the hours. The movement of the stars across the sky could represent the passage of time, with the stars moving from the top (noon) to the bottom (midnight). The hour hand would be represented by a star that moves around the clock face, completing a cycle every 24 hours, symbolizing the continuous flow of time.",
    "**The Galactic Dancehall** - A swirling, dynamic constellation that resembles a dance floor, with stars as dancers. The movement of the stars would mimic the rhythm and beat of music, creating a visual representation of a cosmic dance party. The stars could interact with each other, creating intricate patterns and shapes that evolve over time, reflecting the unpredictable nature of dance.",
    "**The Stellar Library** - This constellation would be shaped like a book, with stars representing pages filled with stories, knowledge, and wisdom. The spine of the book would be a prominent star, symbolizing the core of the library, containing the most important information. The pages would be formed by smaller stars, each one telling a part of a larger story or representing a specific piece of knowledge. The book would appear to open and close over time, symbolizing the ongoing process of learning and sharing information in the universe."
