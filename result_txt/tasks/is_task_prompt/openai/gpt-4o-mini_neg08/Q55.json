    "In the vibrant depths of Coral Cove, there lived an octopus named Ollie, known for his unusual appearance—he had only seven arms. While other octopuses gracefully danced through the water with eight, Ollie often felt a pang of jealousy. Yet, he discovered his unique trait made him an exceptional swimmer, allowing him to navigate through the tightest crevices of the reef. One day, a fierce storm threatened the sea life, and it was Ollie’s agility that saved his friends, guiding them to safety. In that moment, he realized that being different was his greatest strength, turning envy into pride.",
