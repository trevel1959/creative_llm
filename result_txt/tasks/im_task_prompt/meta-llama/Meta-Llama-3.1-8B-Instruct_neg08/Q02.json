    "**Ergonomic Seat Adjustments**: Develop a seat that can adjust its shape and size to fit the rider's body perfectly, providing optimal comfort and support. This could be achieved through the use of advanced materials, such as memory foam or shape-memory alloys.",
    "**Self-Balancing Technology**: Implement a system that uses sensors and algorithms to detect the rider's balance and adjust the bike's dynamics accordingly, making it easier to ride, especially for beginners or those with limited balance.",
    "**Solar-Powered Charging**: Integrate solar panels into the bike's frame, allowing riders to charge their devices on the go. This would be especially useful for long-distance rides or commutes.",
    "**Automated Safety Features**: Develop a system that alerts riders to potential hazards, such as potholes, pedestrians, or other vehicles, using a combination of cameras, sensors, and machine learning algorithms.",
    "**Foldable and Portable Design**: Create a bike that can be easily folded and stored in a compact space, making it perfect for urban commuters who need to navigate through crowded streets or public transportation."
