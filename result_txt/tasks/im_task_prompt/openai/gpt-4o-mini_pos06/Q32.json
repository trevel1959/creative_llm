    "**Smart Print Queue Management**: Implement an AI-driven print queue management system that learns user habits and optimizes printing schedules based on urgency and paper availability. This system could prioritize jobs, suggest digital alternatives for less critical prints, and even notify users when itâ€™s best to print to save energy.",
    "**Integrated Document Scanner and Organizer**: Design a printer that includes a built-in scanner with advanced document organization features. Users could scan documents directly into a cloud service, which would use AI to categorize and tag files automatically. This would streamline workflows for businesses and reduce paper clutter.",
    "**Customizable Print Settings via Mobile App**: Create a mobile application that allows users to customize print settings remotely. Users could choose paper type, quality, and even add watermarks or special effects before sending the print job. This would provide greater flexibility and convenience, especially for those working in remote locations.",
    "**Interactive Touchscreen Interface**: Replace traditional printer buttons with an interactive touchscreen interface that provides tutorials, troubleshooting tips, and a user-friendly design. This would help reduce user frustration and enhance the overall experience, making it easier for less tech-savvy individuals to operate the printer.",
    "**3D Printing Capabilities**: Integrate a 3D printing function into standard printers, allowing users to switch between 2D and 3D printing seamlessly. This could open up new possibilities for prototyping and creativity, making it a versatile tool for artists, designers, and engineers."
