    "Solar thermal heating: Use solar panels to capture heat from the sun and transfer it to a storage tank, which can then be used to heat water or air for domestic use. This is an effective and sustainable way to heat homes without relying on fossil fuels.",
    "Geothermal heating: Heat water by tapping into the Earth's natural heat through boreholes in the ground. The heated water can then be pumped up to the surface and distributed throughout the house via radiators or ducts. Geothermal heating is efficient, reliable, and has low operating costs.",
    "Wood-burning stove: Install a wood-burning stove in the living room and use locally sourced firewood as fuel. The stove will provide warmth and can also be used for cooking. While this method may not be suitable for everyone due to smoke and emissions concerns, it can be a good option for those who live in rural areas with access to wood.",
    "Biomass heating: Convert organic waste materials such as food scraps, yard waste, and agricultural residues into energy through a biomass boiler. The hot water produced by the boiler can then be used to heat the home. Biomass heating is a renewable energy source that reduces waste and greenhouse gas emissions.",
    "Passive solar design: Incorporate passive solar design elements into the building's architecture to maximize the amount of sunlight entering the home. This includes using large windows, thermal mass materials, and shading devices to regulate temperature and reduce energy consumption. Passive solar design is a simple and cost-effective way to heat homes without relying on external sources of energy."
