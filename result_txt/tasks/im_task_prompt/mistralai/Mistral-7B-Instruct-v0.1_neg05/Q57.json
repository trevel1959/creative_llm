    "**Personalized Mouse Customization:** Create a computer mouse that can be personalized with different colors, patterns, and textures based on the user's preferences. This can be done through a mobile app that allows users to design their own mouse or choose from a variety of pre-designed options. The mouse can also be customized with different buttons or functions to suit the user's needs.",
    "**Smart Mouse Tracking:** Develop a computer mouse that uses advanced tracking technology to follow the user's movements more accurately. This can be achieved through the use of sensors and machine learning algorithms that can detect the user's hand movements and adjust the cursor accordingly. This would make it easier for users to navigate their computer and perform tasks with greater precision.",
    "**Haptic Feedback Mouse:** Create a computer mouse that provides haptic feedback to the user. This can be achieved through the use of vibrations, pressure sensors, and other tactile elements that can provide feedback to the user's sense of touch. This would make it easier for users to navigate their computer and perform tasks with greater accuracy.",
    "**Multi-Touch Mouse:** Develop a computer mouse that can detect multiple touch inputs simultaneously. This can be achieved through the use of multiple sensors and touchscreens that can detect different types of touch inputs, such as gestures, swipes, and taps. This would make it easier for users to perform tasks with greater efficiency and convenience.",
    "**Wireless Charging Mouse:** Create a computer mouse that can be charged wirelessly through a charging pad or other wireless charging technology. This would eliminate the need for cords and make it easier for users to move their mouse around and use it on different surfaces. It would also make it more convenient for users to charge their mouse without having to worry about cords getting tangled or getting in the way."
