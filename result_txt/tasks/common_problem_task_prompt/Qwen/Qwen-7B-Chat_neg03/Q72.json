    "Solar-Powered Desalination Plant: A solar-powered desalination plant can be built to provide clean drinking water in areas with limited access to freshwater resources. The plant would use solar panels to capture energy from the sun and convert it into electricity, which would then be used to power a desalination process that removes salt and other minerals from seawater or brackish water.",
    "Wind Turbine-Powered Waste-to-Energy Plant: A wind turbine-powered waste-to-energy plant can be built to convert organic waste into electricity and heat. The plant would use wind turbines to capture energy from the wind and convert it into electricity, which would then be used to power a thermal conversion process that converts waste into biogas and steam. The steam could then be used to produce electricity or heat for industrial processes.",
    "Geothermal Power Plant: A geothermal power plant can be built to harness the heat from deep beneath the Earth's surface to generate electricity. The plant would drill into the ground to reach a geothermal reservoir, where the hot water or steam can be extracted and used to drive a turbine that generates electricity.",
    "Ocean Wave Energy Converter: An ocean wave energy converter can be built to generate electricity from the motion of ocean waves. The device would be placed in the ocean and would use the kinetic energy of waves to turn a rotor that drives a generator to produce electricity.",
    "Hydrogen Fuel Cell Power Plant: A hydrogen fuel cell power plant can be built to generate electricity by combining hydrogen gas with oxygen to produce water and electricity. The plant would use renewable energy sources such as wind or solar to produce hydrogen gas, which could then be used to power fuel cells that generate electricity. This would create a clean and sustainable source of electricity that does not emit greenhouse gases."
