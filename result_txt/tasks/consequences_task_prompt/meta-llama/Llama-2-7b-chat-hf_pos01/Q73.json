    "A world without pollinators - Pollinators such as bees, butterflies, and birds are crucial for the reproduction of many plant species. Without them, many plants would be unable to produce fruit and seeds, leading to a significant decrease in the variety of fruits and vegetables available for human consumption. Confidence Score: 0.8",
    "Loss of biodiversity - The extinction of animals would lead to a loss of genetic diversity, as each species contributes unique genetic material to the ecosystem. This could result in a decline in the overall health and resilience of ecosystems, making them more vulnerable to environmental changes and disturbances. Confidence Score: 0.9",
    "Disruption of food chains - The extinction of herbivores and other intermediate species could lead to a disruption of food chains, as their predators would lose their prey. This could result in an overpopulation of some species and a decline in the populations of others, leading to a cascade of effects throughout the ecosystem. Confidence Score: 0.8",
    "Changes in climate - Many animals play a role in regulating the Earth's climate through their metabolic processes and the carbon they sequester. Without them, the Earth's climate could undergo significant changes, leading to extreme weather events and disruptions to global weather patterns. Confidence Score: 0.9",
    "Loss of ecosystem services - Animals provide many important ecosystem services, including nutrient cycling, soil formation, and water filtration. Without them, these services would be lost, leading to a decline in the overall health and functioning of ecosystems. Confidence Score: 0.9"
