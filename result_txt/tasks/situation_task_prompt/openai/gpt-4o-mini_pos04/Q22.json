    "**Community-Driven Zipline Networks**: In a city where roads have vanished, communities could establish a network of ziplines connecting various neighborhoods and essential locations. These ziplines would be designed for both individual use and cargo transport. Each station would have harnesses and pulleys, allowing people to glide from one point to another quickly. The ziplines could be powered by renewable energy sources and would not only serve as transportation but also as a unique recreational activity for residents.",
    "**Modular Smart Tricycles**: Envision a fleet of modular tricycles that can be customized for different needsâ€”cargo transport, family outings, or personal commuting. These tricycles would feature detachable compartments that could be swapped out depending on the user's requirements. They would be equipped with solar panels to charge their batteries and smart technology that connects to a city-wide app for route optimization, making them a versatile and sustainable transportation solution.",
    "**Underground Pedestrian Tunnels**: With the surface roads gone, cities could invest in extensive underground pedestrian tunnels. These tunnels would be equipped with moving walkways, bike lanes, and even small electric vehicle tracks. The tunnels could feature artistic murals, greenery, and relaxation zones to make the experience enjoyable. They would not only facilitate movement but also protect pedestrians from the elements, creating a safe and comfortable environment.",
    "**Personalized Airships**: Picture a future where personal airships are the norm. These small, drone-like airships would be capable of carrying individuals or small groups over short distances. Users could summon an airship via a smartphone app, and it would navigate to their location, using a combination of GPS and advanced sensors to avoid obstacles. The airships would run on clean energy, providing a serene and scenic way to travel around the city while avoiding traffic entirely.",
    "**Bike-Share Programs with Augmented Reality (AR)**: Without traditional roads, cities could enhance bike-sharing programs by integrating AR technology. Users would wear AR glasses or use their smartphones to visualize safe biking paths that take into account obstacles and elevation changes. The app could also provide real-time updates on bike availability, weather conditions, and suggested routes, making cycling an appealing and interactive way to get around town."
