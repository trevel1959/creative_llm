    "**Smart Hairbrush**: Develop a hairbrush that incorporates sensors to monitor your hair health, tracking factors such as hair breakage, hair density, and scalp condition. The device could send this data to an app on your phone, providing personalized advice on hair care products, styling techniques, and diet recommendations. This idea aims to revolutionize personal grooming by integrating technology into everyday routines.",
    "**Detangling Hairbrush with Built-in Combs**: Create a hairbrush with detachable combs of various sizes for different sections of hair. The brush could have adjustable settings for different hair types and textures, allowing users to effectively detangle without causing damage or breakage. This innovation could cater to both children and adults, simplifying hair care routines and reducing stress associated with tangles.",
    "**Heated Hairbrush for Cold Weather**: Design a hairbrush with built-in heat technology that warms up to prevent cold hands while brushing. This would be particularly useful in colder climates where traditional hairbrushes can lead to discomfort. The brush could also incorporate gentle massage features to stimulate blood flow and improve hair and scalp health.",
    "**Customizable Hairbrush with LED Lighting**: Produce a hairbrush with interchangeable attachments that offer various styling functions (e.g., straightening, curling) and integrated LED lights. The lights could help with low-light conditions when styling hair or applying makeup. Users could customize their brushes based on their preferences and needs, making it a versatile tool for both beauty and grooming.",
    "**Sustainable Bamboo Hairbrush**: Develop a hairbrush made from sustainable bamboo material, which is eco-friendly and biodegradable. The brush could be designed with a soft, natural bristle option to avoid the use of animal products, catering to individuals with ethical concerns. This product would appeal to consumers who prioritize sustainability and environmental responsibility in their purchases."
