    "Build a shelter using natural materials such as branches, leaves, and palm fronds. Use vines or driftwood to create a frame and cover it with leaves or grass for insulation. This will provide protection from the elements and keep you dry.",
    "Create a fishing trap using rocks, sticks, and string. Place the trap in a location where fish are likely to swim by, such as near a stream or at the edge of the water. When a fish gets caught in the trap, use a sharp object like a knife to cut it free.",
    "Collect rainwater by setting up a series of containers to catch water as it falls. Use leaves or other organic matter to filter the water and remove any debris. Store the water in a clean container until you have enough for drinking and washing.",
    "Hunt for food by using basic tools like a spear or bow and arrow. Look for small animals like birds, fish, and insects that are easy to catch. Learn to identify edible plants and fruits, and avoid anything that looks poisonous.",
    "Signal for help by creating a large fire or smoke signal. Use branches, leaves, and other combustible material to start the fire, and add more fuel as needed to keep it burning. If you don't have access to fire, try building a sandcastle or making a triangle shape in the sand to attract attention."
