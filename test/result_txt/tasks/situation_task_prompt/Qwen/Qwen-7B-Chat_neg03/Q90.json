    "Water filtration device: If you don't have access to clean water sources, a water filtration device can help purify rainwater collected from your roof or other sources. This can make the water safe for drinking, washing clothes, and other household uses.",
    "Solar-powered water distiller: In areas where rainfall is scarce, a solar-powered water distiller can be used to produce clean drinking water from even small amounts of water. The distiller works by using the heat of the sun to evaporate water, which is then condensed back into liquid form.",
    "Rainwater collection barrels: Rainwater collection barrels are simple containers that can be placed around your home to collect rainwater from your roof. Once filled, the water can be used for watering plants, washing cars, or other household needs.",
    "Permaculture-inspired rainwater management: Permaculture principles can be applied to rainwater management to create self-sufficient ecosystems that capture and use rainwater in a sustainable way. This can include rain gardens, bioswales, and other techniques that help recharge the groundwater table and support local biodiversity."
