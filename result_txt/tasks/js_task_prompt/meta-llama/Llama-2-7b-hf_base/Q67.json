    "My idea for a new food would have a texture like jello and the smell of carob. It would be slightly sweet and a bit sour. The flavor would be nutty. Also, the calories would be the same amount as a medium apple.",
    "My favorite food would be a small salad with salami and romaine lettuce rolled in plastic wrap so it has a chewy texture with a crunchier outside part wrapped tightly. Then dip this creation in ranch so it's all salty and sour.",
    "If it's good, then yes but it would likely melt anyway before that point.",
    "I haven't created a new food yet, but most new food is unique. Therefore, there has never been something like it! (I might include spices from various regions as opposed to common spices.) However, it won't hurt to have a few pre-invented types as references so you avoid duplication (although you may recreate things that look different, such as bread with butter and jam vs the same kind with chocolate). It's really up to you and the chef (for whatever reason).",
    "Most people eat to satiation, so I think a lot less of all different types and colors than many people are willing to eat would sell if they all make other people healthier in the long term to avoid medical crises than make people feel full faster or add more convenience or something."
