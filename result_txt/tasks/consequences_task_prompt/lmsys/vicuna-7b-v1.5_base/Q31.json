    "Invasive Species: Plants with the ability to walk and move could become invasive species, spreading rapidly across landscapes and displacing native plant species.",
    "Changes in Pollination: Plants could potentially change the way they pollinate, altering the relationship between plants and pollinators. This could have significant effects on the reproduction of many plant species.",
    "Habitat Loss: Plants with the ability to walk and move could alter their habitat by uprooting and moving to new locations, potentially leading to the loss of critical habitats for other species.",
    "Agricultural Impacts: Plants with the ability to walk and move could impact agriculture by outcompeting crops and potentially damaging farming equipment.",
    "Increased Carbon Sequestration: Plants with the ability to walk and move could potentially increase their ability to sequester carbon from the atmosphere, potentially mitigating the effects of climate change."
