    "Artificial Sunlight: Develop an artificial sunlight generator that can be used indoors to provide the necessary amount of light for activities such as reading, working or studying. The generator could use a combination of LED lights and specialized filters to mimic natural sunlight.",
    "Solar-Powered Homes: Encourage the construction of homes with solar panels on their roofs to harness the energy from the sun even when it's cloudy outside. This could help reduce reliance on traditional power sources and make homes more sustainable.",
    "Cloud-Blocking Technology: Research and develop technology that can block clouds from blocking out the sun. This could involve using materials that reflect or scatter sunlight in different directions to keep the sky clear even when there are clouds overhead.",
    "Light-Dependent Plants: Encourage the cultivation of plants that require less sunlight than others, such as those that thrive in low-light conditions. These plants could be grown in urban areas where access to sunlight is limited due to cloud cover.",
    "Sunscreen for Clouds: Develop a sunscreen-like substance that can be applied to clouds to prevent them from reflecting too much sunlight back into space. This could help regulate the Earth's temperature and prevent global warming by reducing the amount of heat absorbed by the atmosphere."
