    "**Developing a Solar-Powered Generator:** This idea involves building or designing a solar-powered generator that can store energy for use when there's no electricity. The generator could utilize photovoltaic cells to convert sunlight into electrical energy. This system would be particularly beneficial in areas with ample sunlight, ensuring a steady supply of power for daily needs such as lighting, cooking, and charging devices.",
    "**Creating an Emergency Water Filtration System:** With electricity cut off, access to clean water might become challenging. A creative solution is to develop a low-tech water filtration system using natural materials like sand, gravel, and activated charcoal. This system can be designed to be portable and efficient, ensuring a constant supply of clean drinking water during power outages.",
    "**Designing a Hand-Cranked Electronic Device Charger:** In the absence of electricity, charging electronic devices becomes a challenge. A hand-cranked charger could provide a simple yet effective solution. Users can manually turn a handle to generate power, which can then be stored in rechargeable batteries. These batteries can power devices like flashlights, radios, and mobile phones when needed.",
    "**Inventing a Solar-Powered Light Source with Battery Backup:** A solar-powered light source with a built-in battery backup can significantly enhance safety and comfort during power outages. The light would automatically switch to battery power when the sun goes down or if the electricity fails. This invention would also include a small solar panel to recharge the battery during daylight hours.",
    "**Developing a Solar-Powered Weather Station:** A weather station that utilizes solar power can provide crucial information about temperature, humidity, wind speed, and other environmental factors. This station could be especially useful for predicting weather changes, which can help individuals prepare for potential hazards like storms or extreme heatwaves. The data collected by the weather station can be transmitted to smartphones or other devices through radio waves or other communication technologies."
