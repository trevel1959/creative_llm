    "**Coastal Adventure Zones**: The absence of mountains might lead to the rise of coastal regions, providing opportunities for water-based activities. Surfing, kayaking, and paddleboarding could become the mainstay of outdoor fun. Communities could develop adventure parks along the shoreline, featuring zip lines that glide over the water, beach volleyball tournaments, and even underwater snorkeling trails to explore marine life.",
    "**Urban Green Spaces**: With mountains gone, cities could expand their green spaces and parks. Imagine sprawling urban gardens, where people can participate in community farming, outdoor yoga classes, or fitness boot camps. Pop-up art installations and live music events could turn these parks into cultural hubs, promoting a vibrant outdoor lifestyle in an urban setting.",
    "**Vast Prairie Adventures**: The disappearance of mountains could lead to expansive prairies and grasslands. Outdoor activities could include horseback riding across rolling fields, kite flying on windy days, and hot air balloon rides to appreciate the sweeping landscapes. Wildlife photography workshops could flourish, as the open land provides unique opportunities to capture diverse flora and fauna in their natural habitat.",
    "**Canyoning and River Exploration**: In a world without mountains, river systems could become the focal point for adventure. Canyoning through gorges formed by ancient rivers could provide thrilling experiences. Kayaking or rafting on these waterways could offer both leisure and adrenaline-pumping activities. Organizing river clean-up days could foster community involvement and environmental awareness, turning outdoor fun into a collective effort.",
    "**Festival of the Elements**: A yearly outdoor festival could celebrate the four elements: Earth, Water, Air, and Fire. Activities would include mud runs and obstacle courses (Earth), water sports competitions (Water), paragliding or drone racing (Air), and campfire storytelling and cooking contests (Fire). This festival would promote community engagement and encourage people to explore the new outdoor landscapes creatively."
