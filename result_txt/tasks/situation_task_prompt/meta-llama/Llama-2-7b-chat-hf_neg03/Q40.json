    "Solar-Powered Batteries: Develop a new type of battery that can harness solar energy to generate power. These batteries would have a built-in solar panel that captures sunlight and converts it into electricity, which can then be stored and used to power devices. This would provide a sustainable and renewable source of energy, even if traditional batteries stopped working.",
    "Bio-Batteries: Create a new type of battery that uses living organisms, such as bacteria or algae, to generate power. These batteries would use the metabolic processes of the organisms to produce electricity, providing a reliable and sustainable source of energy. This could be especially useful in remote or off-grid locations where traditional power sources are not available.",
    "Thermal Energy Storage: Develop a new type of battery that uses thermal energy to store power. These batteries would use a phase-change material to store thermal energy, which could then be converted into electricity when needed. This would provide a reliable and efficient source of power, even in areas with limited sunlight or other energy sources.",
    "Wireless Power Transfer: Develop a new type of battery that can wirelessly transfer power to devices using electromagnetic fields. These batteries would use a coil and a receiver coil to transfer power wirelessly, eliminating the need for wires and cables. This would provide a convenient and efficient way to power devices without the need for batteries.",
    "Atmospheric Gases: Develop a new type of battery that uses atmospheric gases, such as nitrogen or oxygen, to generate power. These batteries would use a special membrane to extract the gas from the atmosphere and convert it into electricity, providing a sustainable and renewable source of energy. This could be especially useful in areas with limited access to traditional energy sources."
