    "**Cognitive Function Decline**: Without sleep, the brain's ability to process information, learn new things, and make decisions would significantly deteriorate. The hippocampus, which plays a crucial role in memory consolidation and learning, would be severely impacted. This could result in an inability to learn from experiences, leading to a regression in technological advancements and societal progress.",
    "**Health Risks**: Sleep has been shown to play a critical role in immune function, metabolism, and hormone regulation. Without it, the body would be more susceptible to infections and diseases. Chronic sleep deprivation has also been linked to obesity, diabetes, and cardiovascular disease. Humans would face an increased risk of these conditions, potentially leading to a decrease in overall population health.",
    "**Social Dynamics Shift**: Sleep patterns influence social behaviors, such as when people choose to interact or work. If everyone had to stay awake at all times, traditional work schedules and social activities would likely need to change drastically. For instance, businesses might have to operate around the clock, while social gatherings would need to be planned to accommodate everyone's active hours. This could lead to a redefinition of community norms and daily routines.",
    "**Increased Mental Health Issues**: Sleep disorders are already prevalent among humans. Without the ability to sleep, the mental health impacts could be severe. Conditions like insomnia, anxiety, and depression could become even more common due to the constant stress of staying awake. Additionally, sleep deprivation can lead to hallucinations and delirium, potentially causing psychological distress on a large scale.",
    "**Economic Impact**: In the absence of sleep, productivity would plummet across various sectors. Manufacturing, construction, and service industries that rely heavily on human labor would be directly affected. Economies could experience a recession due to reduced output, higher healthcare costs, and decreased innovation. The cost of maintaining and sustaining human life would increase dramatically, potentially leading to economic instability."
