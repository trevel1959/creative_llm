    "-cooling pads: We could create cooling pads that are similar to the ones used in cars, but portable and designed for outdoor use. These pads could be placed on the ground or other surfaces to provide a cool and comfortable place to rest on a hot day. ",
    "-----------rant: We could design a--rant that would provide a cooling effect by circulating air through it. This-rant could be made of a lightweight and durable material, and could be easily transported for use in outdoor areas. ",
    "Rent---------rant: We could create a-rant that would use solar energy to provide a cooling effect. This-rant could be placed in areas with high levels of sunlight, and would use solar panels to generate electricity that would power a cooling system within the rental. ",
    "Rentatio-rant: We could design a-rant that would use artificial intelligence to provide a cooling effect. This rental would use sensors to monitor the temperature and humidity levels in the area, and would adjust the cooling system accordingly to provide the most comfortable environment for the user."
