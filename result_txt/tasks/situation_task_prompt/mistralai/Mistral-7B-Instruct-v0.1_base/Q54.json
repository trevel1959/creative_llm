    "Develop a network of underwater tunnels: One solution could be to to develop a network of underwater tunnels that would allow people to travel from one side of a large body of water to the other. The tunnels could be designed to be stable and secure, and could be used to transport people, goods, and vehicles.",
    "Build a fleet of floating cities: Another solution could be to build a fleet of floating cities that could be used to transport people across a large body of water. These cities could be designed to be self-sustaining and could be used as temporary or permanent settlements.",
    "Develop a fleet of airships: A third solution could be to develop a fleet of airships that could be used to transport people across a large body of water. These airships could be designed to be lightweight and fuel-efficient, and could be used for both short and long-distance travel.",
    "Build a network of underwater bridges: A fourth solution could be to build a network of underwater bridges that would allow people to cross a large body of water. These bridges could be designed to be stable and secure, and could be used to transport people, goods, and vehicles.",
    "Develop a fleet of hydrofoil boats: A fifth solution could be to develop a fleet of hydrofoil boats that could be used to transport people across a large body of water. These boats could be designed to be fast and efficient, and could be used for both short and long-distance travel."
