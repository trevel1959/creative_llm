    "Leonardo da Vinci - Confidence Score: 0.8",
    "Create a new form of transportation: Da Vinci was fascinated by the idea of flight and designed several flying machines. I would ask him to create a new form of transportation that combines his knowledge of aerodynamics and engineering. He could design a high-speed transportation system that is both efficient and environmentally friendly.",
    "Develop a new material for space exploration: Da Vinci was interested in the properties of materials and their applications. I would ask him to develop a new material that could withstand the harsh conditions of space travel and exploration. He could create a lightweight, durable material that could be used for spacecraft construction, insulation, and protection from radiation.",
    "Design a new form of communication: Da Vinci was a master of visual communication and was known for his use of symbols and diagrams. I would ask him to design a new form of communication that combines visual and auditory elements. He could create a system that uses visual symbols to convey complex ideas and concepts, and also includes an auditory component to enhance understanding and engagement.",
    "Create a new form of art: Da Vinci was a master of many art forms, including painting, sculpture, and engineering. I would ask him to create a new form of art that combines his knowledge of art and science. He could create a new form of sculpture that incorporates movement and light, or a new form of painting that incorporates 3D elements and movement."
