    "**Rule of Kindness:** Everyone must practice kindness every day towards at least one person who doesn't usually receive it. This rule aims to cultivate a more empathetic society where people are encouraged to look beyond their immediate circles and extend kindness to those often overlooked or marginalized. The reasoning behind this is that small acts of kindness can have a profound impact on someone's day and can potentially spread positivity throughout communities.",
    "**Zero Waste Day:** Once a week, every individual must commit to producing zero waste. This rule would encourage sustainable living practices by reducing the amount of garbage produced. It promotes recycling, composting, and reusing materials as much as possible. The rationale is that reducing waste can significantly decrease pollution and strain on landfills, leading to a healthier environment.",
    "**Mandated Mental Health Check-ins:** Every person must schedule and attend regular mental health check-ins, similar to physical health check-ups. This rule ensures that mental well-being receives equal attention to physical health. By making mental health appointments mandatory, it breaks down the stigma surrounding mental health issues and encourages proactive care, leading to happier and healthier individuals.",
    "**Global Language Day:** A single day each year when everyone learns and speaks a new language.

The reasoning is that learning a new language enhances cognitive skills, broadens perspectives, and fosters connections between different cultures and communities worldwide.",
    "**Digital Detox Hour:** For an hour each day, everyone must disconnect from digital devices. This rule aims to combat the excessive use of technology and its potential negative impacts on mental health and social interactions.
