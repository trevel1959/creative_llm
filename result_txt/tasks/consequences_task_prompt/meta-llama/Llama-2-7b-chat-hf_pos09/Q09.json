    "Buildings and structures would be significantly lighter and more efficient, requiring less material to construct and maintain.",
    "Transportation costs and energy consumption would decrease as lighter objects and people could move more easily and quickly, leading to reduced fuel consumption and lower emissions.",
    "Space exploration and colonization would become more feasible as the reduced gravity would make it easier for spacecraft and humans to escape Earth's gravitational pull and travel to other planets and celestial bodies.",
    "The Earth's atmosphere would be affected as the reduced gravity would cause the atmosphere to expand, potentially leading to changes in weather patterns and the formation of new atmospheric phenomena.",
    "The halving of gravity could lead to unforeseen and revolutionary changes in the fields of biology, physics, and astronomy, as organisms and objects would behave differently in a lower gravity environment, leading to new discoveries and insights."
