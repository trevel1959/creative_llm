    "**Eco-friendly Vacuum**: Incorporate environmentally friendly materials and energy-efficient technology to reduce the vacuum's carbon footprint. This could include using renewable energy sources or creating a recyclable vacuum design.",
    "**Multi-functional Vacuum**: Combine the vacuum cleaner with other cleaning tools, such as a steam mop or a handheld vacuum, to provide a single device that can handle multiple cleaning tasks. This would reduce the need for multiple cleaning tools and simplify the cleaning process.",
    "**Wearable Vacuum**: Design a vacuum cleaner that can be worn as a backpack or a belt, allowing the user to move around the room while cleaning. This would be particularly useful for large cleaning jobs or in spaces with limited maneuverability.",
    "**Vacuum with Self-recharging Battery**: Develop a vacuum cleaner with a self-recharging battery system that can be charged while the vacuum is in use. This would eliminate the need to stop cleaning to recharge the battery, making the cleaning process more efficient.",
    "**Vacuum with Advanced Filtration**: Implement advanced filtration systems to capture more dust and allergens, improving indoor air quality. This could include HEPA filters or UV-C light technology to kill bacteria and viruses."
