    "**Eco-Friendly Wedding Theme: \"Blooming Hope\"**: Create a whimsical and romantic atmosphere by incorporating elements of nature into the wedding decor. Use a palette of pastel colors and incorporate real flowers, greenery, and living walls to bring the outdoors in. The wedding arch can be designed to resemble a blooming tree, with flowers and leaves cascading down. This theme not only reduces waste but also celebrates the beauty of nature.",
    "**Sustainable Transportation: \"Love on Wheels\"**: Instead of renting traditional wedding cars, consider using eco-friendly transportation options like electric or hybrid vehicles. You can also use bicycles or vintage cars to add a touch of whimsy to the wedding procession. This not only reduces carbon emissions but also creates a unique and memorable experience for the guests.",
    "**Zero-Waste Food and Drinks: \"Taste of Abundance\"**: Plan a farm-to-table menu that showcases locally sourced and seasonal ingredients. Use compostable or biodegradable plates, cups, and cutlery to minimize waste. Consider a \"pay-as-you-go\" system for food and drinks, where guests can purchase what they want and take the leftovers home. This approach not only reduces waste but also promotes sustainability and community engagement.",
    "**Eco-Friendly Favors: \"Seed of Love\"**: Give your guests a small token of appreciation that's also a symbol of your commitment to sustainability. Offer seed bombs, small potted plants, or packets of wildflower seeds that guests can plant in their own gardens. This not only reduces waste but also encourages guests to get involved in eco-friendly activities.",
    "**Carbon Offset Wedding: \"Love in Action\"**: Calculate the carbon footprint of your wedding and offset it by investing in renewable energy projects or reforestation efforts. You can also partner with a local organization to plant trees or support a community garden. This approach not only reduces your carbon footprint but also creates a lasting impact on the environment. To make it more engaging, you can include a \"carbon offset\" station where guests can learn about the project and contribute to it. This can be a unique and meaningful way to involve your guests in your commitment to sustainability. [/INST] "
