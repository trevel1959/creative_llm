    "**Environmental Impact**: The park's natural environment may be threatened by human activities, such as littering, camping, and off-road vehicle use. These activities can lead to habitat destruction, soil erosion, and water pollution. Managing these impacts requires effective regulations, enforcement, and public education.",
    "**Overcrowding**: National parks can become overrun with visitors, leading to congestion, noise, and disturbance to wildlife. This can negatively affect the visitor experience and the well-being of the park's ecosystem. To address this, the park might need to implement strategies to manage visitor numbers, such as timed-entry tickets or seasonal closures.",
    "**Climate Change**: Climate change can have significant impacts on national parks, including changes in temperature, precipitation, and sea level. These changes can lead to habitat loss, increased fire risk, and the displacement of wildlife. Park management must consider climate change in their planning and adapt to these changing conditions.",
    "**Infrastructure Maintenance**: National parks often have a variety of infrastructure, including roads, trails, and buildings. Ensuring that this infrastructure is well-maintained can be a significant challenge, especially when dealing with remote locations and harsh weather conditions. Regular maintenance and investment in infrastructure are necessary to ensure the safety and enjoyment of visitors.",
    "**Wildlife Management**: Managing wildlife populations within a national park can be complex. Overpopulation of certain species can lead to overgrazing, habitat degradation, and competition for resources. Effective wildlife management strategies, such as population control and habitat restoration, are necessary to maintain a healthy ecosystem."
