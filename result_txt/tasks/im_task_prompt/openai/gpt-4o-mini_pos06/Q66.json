    "**Modular Design with Stackable Containers**: Create a picnic basket with a modular design that includes stackable, airtight containers for different food items. Each container could have a unique color or pattern, making it easy to identify contents at a glance. This would allow for efficient organization and prevent cross-contamination of flavors, while also making it easier to pack and carry.",
    "**Built-in Solar Charger**: Equip the picnic basket with a solar panel on the lid that can charge small electronic devices. This feature would allow picnickers to keep their phones charged for taking photos, using navigation apps, or even playing music. The solar panel could be foldable and lightweight, making it easy to store when not in use.",
    "**Integrated Picnic Blanket**: Design the basket with a detachable, waterproof picnic blanket that can be stored in a dedicated compartment. The blanket could have a built-in pocket for storing small items and a heat-reflective underside to keep the ground cool. This would save space and ensure that picnickers always have a clean, comfortable surface to sit on.",
    "**Multi-functional Utensils**: Include a set of multi-functional utensils that can be stored in a dedicated section of the basket. These utensils could combine a knife, fork, spoon, and bottle opener into a single, compact tool. This would reduce the need for multiple utensils and simplify packing, while also promoting sustainability by reducing single-use plastic cutlery.",
    "**Customizable Exterior Design**: Offer a picnic basket with customizable exterior panels that can be swapped out based on personal style or occasion. Users could choose from various designs, colors, and materials, making it a fashionable accessory for outdoor gatherings. This could include options for seasonal themes, family photos, or even artistic designs that reflect the user's personality."
