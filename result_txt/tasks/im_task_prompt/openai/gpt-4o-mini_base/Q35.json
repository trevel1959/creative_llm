    "**Modular Bed Design**: Create a modular bed that can be easily reconfigured based on the user's needs. For example, the headboard could include interchangeable sections for storage, lighting, or even a mini desk. The base could allow for different configurations (e.g., a single bed, a double bed, or even a bunk bed), making it versatile for various living situations and preferences.",
    "**Integrated Sleep-Inducing Aromatherapy**: Design a bed with built-in aromatherapy diffusers that can release calming scents such as lavender or chamomile.

    "**Adaptive Sound Environment**: Incorporate a sound system that can play white noise, nature sounds, or even personalized playlists that adapt to the user's sleep cycle. The bed could use AI to analyze sleep patterns and adjust the soundscape accordingly, helping to drown out disruptive noises and create a peaceful sleep environment.",
    "**Built-in Sleep Hygiene Tools**: Develop a bed that includes built-in features to promote sleep hygiene, such as a UV light sanitizer for pillows and bedding, a washable mattress cover with antimicrobial properties, and a built-in air purifier. These elements would help maintain a clean and healthy sleep environment, reducing allergens and promoting better overall health.",
    "**Interactive Bed with Mood Lighting**: Design a bed that features customizable LED mood lighting. Users can control the brightness and color of the lights through a mobile app or voice commands, allowing them to create a calming atmosphere for winding down before sleep.
