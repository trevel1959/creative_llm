    "**Smart Leash System**: Create a smart leash system that includes a GPS tracker and Bluetooth connectivity to a smartphone app. This allows pet owners to track their dog's location in real-time and set virtual boundaries. If the dog leaves the designated area, an alert is sent to the owner's phone. Additionally, the leash can vibrate or beep to remind the dog to return if they wander too far.",
    "**Interactive Leash**: Develop a leash with integrated toys or treats that dispense automatically when the dog pulls on it. This not only keeps the dog engaged but also encourages them to follow the lead, making walks more enjoyable and less of a chore for both the dog and the owner.",
    "**Biodegradable Dog Leash**: Craft a leash made from eco-friendly materials like bamboo, hemp, or recycled plastic. These materials are sustainable and break down naturally, reducing environmental impact. This option appeals to environmentally conscious pet owners who prioritize sustainability.",
    "**Adjustable Tension Leash**: Design a leash that adjusts its tension based on the dog's movement. It could use a spring-loaded mechanism that automatically tightens or loosens depending on how quickly the dog is walking or running. This helps maintain control while still allowing for some freedom and flexibility during walks.",
    "**Customizable Leash with Health Monitoring**: Integrate a health monitoring feature into the leash, possibly through a clip-on sensor. The leash could track the dog's activity level, heart rate, and even provide basic health alerts (like signs of dehydration). The data could be synced to the ownerâ€™s smartphone app for easy tracking and monitoring of the dog's well-being. "
