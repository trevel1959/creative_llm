    "Sunglasses with a twist: Design a pair of sunglasses that change color based on the wearer's mood. The lenses could be made of a special material that shifts from clear to dark blue when the wearer smiles, or light pink when they're feeling stressed. This would add a unique and playful touch to the classic sunglasses design.",
    "Smart sunglasses: Develop a pair of sunglasses with built-in technology that enhances the wearer's vision. The lenses could have a built-in camera and microchip that can detect and display information about the surroundings, such as the temperature, humidity, or even the location of nearby points of interest. This would make the sunglasses not only stylish but also practical and functional.",
    "Gaming sunglasses: Create a pair of sunglasses designed specifically for gamers. The lenses could have a built-in display that shows vital information such as health, ammo, or even the location of enemies in a game. The glasses could also have sensors that detect the wearer's head movements and adjust the display accordingly, providing an immersive gaming experience.",
    "Sunglasses with a view: Design a pair of sunglasses with a built-in binocular function. The lenses could be equipped with a special prism that allows the wearer to see distant objects in high definition, making them ideal for birdwatching, hiking, or any other outdoor activity where a wide field of view is necessary.",
    "Personalized sunglasses: Create a pair of sunglasses that can be customized to fit the wearer's face perfectly. The frames could be made of a flexible material that can be molded to fit the individual's head shape, ensuring a comfortable and secure fit. Additionally, the lenses could be made of a special material that can be tinted to the wearer's preferred shade, allowing them to personalize their sunglasses to their liking."
