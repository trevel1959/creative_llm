    "**Self-Cleaning Toothbrush**:    Develop a toothbrush that incorporates UV-C light technology to self-sanitize after each use. A small compartment at the base of the toothbrush would house the UV-C light, activating automatically when the toothbrush is placed back into its holder. This feature would eliminate bacteria and ensure a cleaner brushing experience without the need for frequent replacements.",
    "**Flavor-Infusing Toothbrush**:    Create a toothbrush with a built-in flavor dispenser that releases a mild, safe flavoring agent as you brush. Users could choose from various flavors like mint, cinnamon, or bubblegum. This would make brushing more enjoyable, especially for children or those who dislike traditional toothpaste flavors, potentially increasing their commitment to oral hygiene.",
    "**Toothbrush with Adjustable Bristle Firmness**:    Design a toothbrush with a mechanism that allows users to adjust the firmness of the bristles based on their personal preference or dental needs. A simple twist or push-button feature could change the bristle stiffness from soft to medium to hard. This would cater to individuals with sensitive gums, orthodontic appliances, or those who prefer a firmer brush.",
    "**Eco-Friendly Toothbrush with Refillable Heads**:    Create a sustainable toothbrush made from biodegradable materials with replaceable heads. Users could purchase heads separately, reducing plastic waste. Additionally, the handle could be made from bamboo or recycled materials, promoting environmental consciousness while maintaining oral hygiene.",
    "**Interactive Toothbrush for Kids**:    Design a toothbrush specifically for children that includes an interactive LED display. The toothbrush could feature fun animations or characters that guide kids through a brushing routine, rewarding them with points or virtual stickers for brushing effectively. This gamification approach would encourage children to brush their teeth for the recommended duration while making it a fun activity."
