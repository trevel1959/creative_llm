    "Smart Car: Create a car that can learn and adapt to the driver's behavior and preferences. The car can use sensors and AI to detect the driver's habits and adjust the lighting, temperature, and entertainment system accordingly. The car can also learn the driver's preferred route and provide suggestions for alternative routes to avoid traffic or optimize fuel efficiency.",
    "Personalized Car: Develop a car that can change its appearance and features based on the driver's mood and preferences. For example, the car could have a calm and relaxing interior design for a stress-free drive, or a more energetic and sporty design for a fun road trip. The car could also change its color and lighting to match the driver's mood.",
    "Self-Healing Car: Create a car that can repair and heal itself in case of minor accidents or damage. The car could use nanotechnology and advanced materials to repair damaged parts, or use AI to diagnose and fix problems. This would reduce the need for costly repairs and minimize downtime.",
    "Connected Car: Develop a car that can connect with other cars and infrastructure to improve safety and efficiency. The car could use Wi-Fi or 5G connectivity to communicate with other cars and traffic lights, providing real-time traffic updates and optimizing traffic flow. The car could also use sensors to detect potential accidents and alert other drivers.",
    "Foldable Car: Create a car that can fold up and store in a small space, making it ideal for urban areas or for people who live in small apartments. The car could use advanced materials and design to reduce its size while maintaining its safety and functionality. This would provide a convenient and eco-friendly transportation solution for city dwellers."
