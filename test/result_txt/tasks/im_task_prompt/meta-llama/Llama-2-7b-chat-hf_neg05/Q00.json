    "Pencil Painter: Create a device that allows artists to paint with pencils in a more precise and detailed manner. The device could use a combination of robotics and sensors to track the movement of the pencil and translate it into digital brushstrokes, allowing for intricate and detailed drawings that would be difficult or impossible to achieve by hand.",
    "Pencil Sharpener 2.0: Develop a smart pencil sharpener that can sharpen pencils to a precise point and track the remaining graphite. The device could use sensors to detect when the pencil is getting dull and automatically sharpen it to the optimal point for writing or drawing.",
    "Pencil Case Organizer: Create a pencil case that can hold and organize a variety of pencils, pens, and other writing utensils. The case could use a combination of compartments, dividers, and elastic bands to keep everything tidy and within reach.",
    "Pencil Holder with Built-in Eraser: Design a pencil holder that includes a built-in eraser. The eraser could be a small, round piece of rubber that is integrated into the holder and can be used to erase mistakes or excess graphite. The holder could be made of a durable material, such as plastic or metal, and could be designed to fit comfortably in a desk drawer or on a pencil case.",
    "Pencil with Built-in Stylus: Create a pencil that includes a built-in stylus for use with touchscreens. The stylus could be a small, retractable piece of metal or plastic that is integrated into the pencil and can be extended when needed. This would allow users to easily switch between writing and drawing by hand and using the stylus on touchscreens."
