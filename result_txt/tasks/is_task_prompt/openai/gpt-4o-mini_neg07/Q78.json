    "In the icy expanse of the Arctic, there lived a polar bear named Nanu, who was different from the others. While his friends reveled in snowball fights and icy swims, Nanu longed for the warmth of the sun. One day, he discovered a hidden cove where sunlight danced on the water's surface, casting sparkles like diamonds. Nanu basked there, dreaming of sunny beaches. His friends laughed at him, but Nanu didn’t care. He built a sunbathing rock, inviting them to join. Slowly, they learned to love the sun too, creating a new tradition of warmth amidst the cold—a celebration of friendship.",
