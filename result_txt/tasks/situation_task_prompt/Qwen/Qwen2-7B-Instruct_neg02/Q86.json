    "**Innovative Soap Substitute**: Develop a new substance that can mimic the functions of soap but is sustainable and doesn't disappear. For example, a biodegradable gel that lathers when water is added could be used for cleaning hands or dishes. This gel would be made from natural materials like plant-based surfactants and could be packaged in reusable containers to minimize waste.",
    "**Hygiene Kits**: Create small hygiene kits containing items like wet wipes, dry shampoo, and body wipes that can be used without water. These kits could be designed to be easily portable and could include compact tools for maintaining personal hygiene on the go.",
    "**Airborne Cleaning Techniques**: Explore methods of cleaning that don't require direct contact with skin. This could involve using ultraviolet light to disinfect surfaces, or creating a misting device that sprays an antimicrobial solution into the air to kill germs. Regular use of such devices could help maintain cleanliness in public spaces.",
    "**Smart Clothing**: Design clothes with built-in technology that cleans them automatically. For example, fabrics infused with silver ions which naturally inhibit bacterial growth could be used to create self-cleaning garments. These clothes could also incorporate sensors to detect when they need to be cleaned and activate a cleaning process.",
    "**Community Clean-Up Stations**: Establish communal clean-up stations in strategic locations where people gather (like parks, bus stops, etc.). These stations could contain basic supplies like hand sanitizers, wipes, and simple cleaning solutions for individuals to use as needed. This encourages a community-wide responsibility towards maintaining cleanliness."
