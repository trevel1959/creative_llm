    "**Smart Thermos with Integrated Meal Planning and Nutrition Analysis**: Design a thermos that not only keeps drinks hot or cold for hours but also comes equipped with a meal planning and nutrition analysis feature. The thermos would have a built-in touchscreen display that allows users to input their dietary goals, preferences, and restrictions. It would then suggest healthy meal options and provide detailed nutrition analysis, including macronutrient breakdowns and calorie counts. The thermos could also integrate with popular health and fitness apps to track progress and provide personalized recommendations.",
    "**Thermos with Built-in Water Purification System**: Develop a thermos that includes a built-in water purification system, making it possible to drink safe and clean water from any source. The thermos would utilize advanced technologies such as UV light, activated carbon, or ceramic filters to remove contaminants and bacteria from the water. This feature would be particularly useful for outdoor enthusiasts, travelers, or individuals living in areas with limited access to clean drinking water.",
    "**Smart Thermos with Temperature-Controlled Food Preservation**: Create a thermos that not only keeps drinks at the perfect temperature but also preserves food at the optimal temperature for up to 24 hours. The thermos would have a built-in temperature control system that ensures food stays within a safe temperature range (between 40°F and 140°F) to prevent bacterial growth and spoilage. This feature would be ideal for picnics, camping trips, or for people who often eat on-the-go.",
    "**Thermos with Integrated Cooking and Heating Functionality**: Design a thermos that doubles as a portable cooking and heating device. The thermos would have a built-in heating element and a cooking compartment that allows users to prepare simple meals, such as soups, oatmeal, or instant noodles. The thermos could also come equipped with a built-in timer and temperature control system to ensure perfect cooking results.",
    "**Thermos with Air Quality Monitoring and Purification**: Develop a thermos that not only keeps drinks at the perfect temperature but also monitors and purifies the air around it. The thermos would be equipped with advanced sensors that detect pollutants, allergens, and other airborne contaminants. It would then use a built-in air purification system to remove these particles, improving the overall air quality and making it safer to breathe. This feature would be particularly useful for people with respiratory issues or those living in areas with poor air quality.
