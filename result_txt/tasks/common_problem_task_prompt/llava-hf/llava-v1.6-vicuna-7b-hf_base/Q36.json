    "Space: Depending on the type and size of solar panels, there may not be enough space on every home's roof to install them. This could lead to inefficiencies or the need for multiple panels on each roof.",
    "Maintenance: Solar panels require regular maintenance to ensure their efficiency. If homeowners are not properly informed about how to maintain their panels or are not responsible enough to do so, the panels may become less efficient over time.",
    "Aesthetics: Solar panels can be an eyesore, and some homeowners may not want them on their roofs. This could result in negative aesthetic affects on the neighborhood.",
    "Weather: Solar panels are not efficient in the cold or the snow. This means that homes in colder climates may not benefit as much from solar panels as those in sunnier locations.",
    "Grid Connection: Homes may need to be connected to the grid in order to use solar energy. This could lead to problems with power outages or fluctuations in energy pricing."
