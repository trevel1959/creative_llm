    "**Self-Cleaning Mechanism**: Introduce a self-cleaning feature that uses steam and high-pressure water jets to clean the internal components of the juicer after use. This would eliminate the hassle of manual cleaning and encourage more frequent use. Users could simply add water and press a button, and the juicer would take care of the rest.",
    "**Multi-Functionality with Food Processor Capabilities**: Design a juicer that can also function as a food processor. By adding interchangeable blades and attachments, users could chop, slice, or shred vegetables and fruits before juicing them. This would make it a versatile kitchen appliance, saving space and time.",
    "**Eco-Friendly Materials and Energy Efficiency**: Create a juicer made from sustainable materials, such as bamboo, recycled plastics, or biodegradable components. Additionally, implement energy-efficient technology that reduces power consumption while maintaining high performance. This would appeal to environmentally conscious consumers and promote sustainable living.",
    "**Personalized Juice Packs**: Offer a subscription service that provides pre-packaged, portioned ingredients for specific juice recipes tailored to individual health needs (e.g., detox, energy boost, immune support). The juicer could have a special compartment to hold these packs, ensuring the right ratios and combinations for optimal flavor and nutrition.",
    "**Juice Infuser Attachment**: Introduce an attachment that allows users to infuse their juices with herbs, spices, or additional flavors while juicing. This could be a compartment that holds ingredients like ginger, mint, or turmeric, releasing their flavors into the juice as it is being processed. It would enhance the taste and health benefits of the juice without additional steps."
