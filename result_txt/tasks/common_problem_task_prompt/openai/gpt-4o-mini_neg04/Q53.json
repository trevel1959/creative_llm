    "**Plot Holes and Inconsistencies**: A screenplay can suffer from plot holes where events do not logically follow from one another, or inconsistencies in character behavior and motivations can confuse viewers. To avoid this, writers should outline their story thoroughly before diving into writing. Using a detailed beat sheet can help map out the plot and ensure that all story elements align logically and consistently.",
    "**Pacing Problems**: A screenplay may have pacing issues where certain scenes drag on too long while others feel rushed. This can disrupt the audience's engagement. To remedy this, writers should focus on the rhythm of the story, balancing dialogue, action, and exposition. Reading the screenplay aloud or using pacing software can help identify sections that need tightening or expanding.",
    "**Dialogue Dilemmas**: Writing realistic and engaging dialogue can be a challenge. Dialogue may sound unnatural or overly expository, leading to a lack of authenticity. To enhance dialogue, writers can practice writing conversations in real life, paying attention to how people communicate. Additionally, incorporating subtext—what characters mean but don’t say—can create more dynamic interactions.",
    "**Genre Confusion**: A screenplay might not clearly establish its genre, leading to confusion for the audience and potential producers. This can dilute the film's impact and marketability. Writers should identify the primary genre and subgenres early in the writing process and ensure that the tone, themes, and character actions align with those expectations. Creating a mood board or reference list of films in the chosen genre can help maintain focus.",
    "**Theme Underdevelopment**: Themes are the underlying messages or ideas in a screenplay, and they can often be overlooked. A lack of thematic clarity can leave audiences feeling unsatisfied or confused. Writers should determine the central theme before writing and weave it throughout the narrative. Using motifs, symbols, and character arcs that reflect the theme can create a more cohesive and impactful story."
