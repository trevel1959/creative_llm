    "**Modular Design with Removable Sleeves**: Create a modular sweater that features removable sleeves and a detachable collar. This would allow the wearer to customize the sweater’s style and functionality, transforming it from a long-sleeve to a short-sleeve design or even into a stylish vest. This adaptability could cater to varying temperatures and fashion preferences.",
    "**Integrated Smart Technology**: Incorporate smart technology into the sweater, such as built-in sensors that monitor the wearer’s heart rate and body temperature. This could connect to a mobile app, providing health insights and alerts if the wearer is too cold or overheating, thus merging fashion with health monitoring.",
    "**Eco-Friendly and Biodegradable Materials**: Design a sweater made from 100% eco-friendly and biodegradable materials, such as organic cotton, hemp, or recycled plastics. This approach not only addresses environmental concerns but also appeals to eco-conscious consumers who want sustainable fashion choices.",
    "**Mood-Enhancing Color-Changing Fabric**: Utilize color-changing fabric that shifts hues based on the wearer’s mood or surrounding environment. This could be achieved through thermochromic or photochromic materials, allowing the sweater to change colors with temperature changes or UV exposure, providing a unique and personal expression of style.",
    "**Built-In Aromatherapy Pockets**: Introduce small, discreet pockets within the sweater designed to hold essential oil-infused pads. These pads could release calming or invigorating scents throughout the day, enhancing the wearer’s mood and promoting relaxation or energy depending on their needs."
