    "**Sponge Planters**: Create small sponge planters for tiny indoor plants. By soaking the sponge in water and letting it dry, you can form a porous structure that holds moisture for plant roots while allowing air to circulate. This method could be especially beneficial for plants that require consistent moisture but dislike sitting in soggy soil.",
    "**Sponge Art Supplies**: Use sponges as unconventional art supplies for painting and drawing. Cut sponges into different shapes and sizes to create unique textures on paper or canvas. This could be an interesting way for artists to experiment with new styles and techniques.",
    "**Sponge Sound Absorbers**: Create wall-mounted or freestanding sound absorbers by cutting sponges into panels and attaching them to walls or ceilings. Sponges are great at absorbing sound frequencies, which can help reduce noise pollution in rooms where acoustics need improvement.",
    "**Sponge Ice Packs**: Make reusable ice packs by wrapping sponges in plastic wrap and freezing them. They can be used for keeping food cold or for soothing injuries. The sponges are softer and more comfortable than traditional ice packs, reducing the risk of frostbite or skin irritation.",
    "**Sponge Bath Mats**: Design bath mats made from sponges that absorb water quickly and dry easily. These mats can be placed under showerheads or next to bathtubs to catch water and prevent slippery floors, making them safer and easier to clean."
