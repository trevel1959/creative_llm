    "Sleep would be more challenging: Without the darkness of night, it would be more difficult to fall asleep and stay asleep. Our bodies are naturally programmed to sleep during the night when it is dark, and the absence of this cue could make it harder to get a good night's rest.",
    "I would sleep during the day: If there were no more night-time, I would likely adjust my sleep schedule and sleep during the day instead. This would allow me to take advantage of the natural light and potentially feel more alert and energized during the day.",
    "I would use light therapy: Another option would be to use light therapy to help regulate my sleep-wake cycle. This involves exposing myself to bright light during the day to help me feel more alert, and then using dimmer light at night to help me wind down and fall asleep.",
    "I would take naps: If I were to sleep during the day, I might also consider taking naps throughout the day to help me stay alert and focused. Naps can be a great way to recharge and improve productivity, especially during the day.",
    "I would try new sleep techniques: Finally, if there were no more night-time, I might try new sleep techniques to help me get a good night's rest. This could include things like meditation, breathing exercises, or progressive muscle relaxation. These techniques can help to calm the mind and body and promote relaxation, making it easier to fall asleep."
