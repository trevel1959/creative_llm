    "Wear a Solar-Powered Hat: Design a hat that harnesses the power of the sun to generate a cooling effect on the wearer's head. This could be achieved through a built-in solar panel that captures sunlight and converts it into energy, which is then used to power a small fan or cooling system within the hat. This would provide a cooling effect on the wearer's head, protecting it from sunburn.",
    "Develop a Sunburn-Resistant Material: Create a special material that is able to absorb and reflect the sun's UV rays, preventing them from reaching the wearer's head. This material could be applied to a hat or a bandana, providing a barrier between the wearer's head and the sun's harmful rays.",
    "Use a Sun-Sensing Chromebook: Design a chromebook that can detect the amount of sunlight exposure the wearer is receiving and adjust its brightness accordingly. This would ensure that the wearer's eyes are protected from glare and sunburn, while also providing a comfortable viewing experience.",
    "Create a Solar-Powered Sunscreen Applicator: Develop a small, portable device that can apply sunscreen to the wearer's head and face using solar power. This device could be worn as a headband or a wristband, providing a convenient and eco-friendly way to protect the wearer's skin from the sun.",
    "Invent a Sunburn-Preventing Haircut: Develop a special haircut that is designed to prevent sunburn. This could involve cutting the hair in a way that creates a natural canopy or umbrella over the wearer's head, providing protection from the sun's rays. Alternatively, the haircut could be designed to absorb or reflect UV rays, further protecting the wearer's head and face."
