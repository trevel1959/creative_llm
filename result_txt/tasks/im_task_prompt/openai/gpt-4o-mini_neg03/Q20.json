    "**Self-Cleaning Mechanism**: Design a coffee maker with a self-cleaning feature that uses ultrasonic waves or steam to clean internal components. This would eliminate the hassle of regular cleaning, ensuring that the coffee maker remains in optimal condition and that the coffee tastes fresh without any residue buildup. Users could activate the cleaning cycle through a simple button press or through the connected app.",
    "**Modular Design**: Create a modular coffee maker that allows users to swap out components based on their brewing preferences. For example, users could choose between a French press module, an espresso module, or a pour-over module. This would allow coffee enthusiasts to experiment with different brewing methods without needing multiple machines, making it more versatile and space-efficient.",
    "**Flavor Infusion Chamber**: Introduce a flavor infusion chamber where users can add spices, herbs, or flavored syrups that can be steeped with the coffee grounds during brewing. This would allow for a customizable flavor experience, enabling users to create unique coffee blends and experiment with different flavor profiles, from chai-infused coffee to herbal blends.",
    "**Sustainable Coffee Grounds Recycling**: Incorporate a built-in system for recycling used coffee grounds. The coffee maker could include a compartment that collects the grounds, which can then be easily removed and used for composting or as a natural fertilizer. This eco-friendly feature would appeal to environmentally conscious consumers and promote sustainability.",
    "**Integrated Coffee Scale**: Build an integrated digital scale into the coffee maker that weighs coffee grounds before brewing. This would help users achieve the perfect coffee-to-water ratio for their preferred brew strength. The scale could provide feedback and recommendations through the app, guiding users to the ideal measurements based on the type of coffee bean and brewing method selected."
