    "**Interchangeable Plates:** Design the waffle iron with interchangeable plates that allow users to create various shapes and styles of waffles, such as heart-shaped, star-shaped, or even mini-waffles. This could include a plate for making waffle sandwiches, which could be a hit for kids and brunch lovers alike.",
    "**Integrated Recipe Book:** Equip the waffle iron with a built-in recipe book that offers a variety of waffle recipes, including sweet, savory, and international styles. The assistant could provide step-by-step instructions, including ingredient measurements and cooking times, displayed on a small screen or via a connected app.",
    "**Self-Cleaning Feature:** Implement a self-cleaning mechanism that uses steam or high-temperature air to clean the plates after use. This feature would make the waffle iron more user-friendly and encourage regular use without the hassle of cleanup.",
    "**Batter Dispenser and Mixer:** Include an integrated batter dispenser that mixes the ingredients and dispenses the perfect amount of batter into the waffle iron. This would eliminate the mess of pouring batter and ensure uniform waffle sizes, making the process quicker and more efficient.",
    "**Flavor Infuser:** Create a flavor infusion system that allows users to add extracts, spices, or even fruit purees directly into the batter during the cooking process. This feature would enable the creation of unique flavored waffles without additional preparation steps."
