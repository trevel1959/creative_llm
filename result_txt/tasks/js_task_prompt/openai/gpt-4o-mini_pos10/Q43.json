    "**Emergency Response Optimization**: First responders, such as firefighters and paramedics, could utilize wall-penetrating vision during emergencies. This ability would allow them to assess the interior layout of a burning building or locate trapped individuals without wasting precious time. They could identify safe paths, locate hazardous materials, and determine the best entry points for rescue operations. This capability would significantly improve response times and save lives by providing crucial information in real-time.",
    "**Home Security Innovations**: Home security systems could be transformed with this power. Security professionals could assess potential vulnerabilities in a home by seeing through walls to identify hidden entry points, weak spots, or areas lacking surveillance. They could design tailored security measures that address these vulnerabilities, ensuring comprehensive protection for homeowners. Additionally, this ability could aid in the investigation of criminal activities, allowing law enforcement to gather evidence without invasive searches.",
    "**Thermal Energy Audits**: Environmental scientists and energy auditors could harness this power to conduct thermal energy audits of buildings. By seeing through walls, they could identify insulation gaps, air leaks, and energy inefficiencies that are not visible to the naked eye. This would lead to more effective recommendations for energy-saving upgrades, helping homeowners and businesses reduce their carbon footprint and lower energy costs. The data gathered could also contribute to larger studies on urban energy consumption patterns.",
    "**Historical Preservation**: Preservationists and historians could utilize this ability to examine the hidden layers of historical buildings without causing damage. They could see the original materials, construction methods, and any modifications made over the years. This insight would enable them to restore buildings to their former glory more accurately and educate the public about architectural history. Furthermore, they could uncover lost artifacts or documents concealed within walls, providing a richer understanding of the past.",
    "**Educational Experiences**: In educational settings, this power could be used to create interactive learning experiences. Students studying architecture, engineering, or history could engage with real-life case studies, observing how buildings are constructed and maintained from the inside out. Virtual reality applications could simulate this experience, allowing students to explore the internal workings of structures while learning about their design and function. This immersive approach could inspire future generations of architects and engineers."
