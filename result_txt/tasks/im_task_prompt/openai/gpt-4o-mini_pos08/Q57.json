    "**Integrated Gesture Control**: Develop a mouse that incorporates gesture recognition technology. Users could perform specific hand movements in the air to execute commands, such as swiping to scroll or pinching to zoom. This feature would provide an intuitive way to interact with digital content, especially for graphic designers and gamers, allowing for more fluid navigation without needing to rely solely on traditional clicking.",
    "**Environmental Feedback System**: Create a mouse equipped with haptic feedback that can simulate different textures or resistance levels based on the task being performed. For instance, when editing photos, the mouse could provide a smooth glide, while during gaming, it could offer resistance to enhance the feeling of control. This feature would enrich the user experience and make digital interactions feel more tangible.",
    "**Modular Design**: Design a modular mouse that allows users to swap out components based on their preferences or needs. Users could change the mouse's weight, button configuration, or even add features like a scroll wheel or extra buttons for specific applications. This flexibility would cater to various user types, from casual web surfers to hardcore gamers, enabling them to create a mouse that fits their unique style.",
    "**Biometric Security Features**: Incorporate biometric sensors, such as fingerprint scanners, into the mouse. This would allow for secure logins to devices and applications without needing passwords. Users could simply place their finger on the mouse to authenticate, enhancing security while also providing convenience for accessing sensitive information.",
    "**Wireless Charging Base**: Develop a computer mouse that comes with a stylish wireless charging base that doubles as a desktop organizer. The base would not only charge the mouse but also have compartments for storing small office supplies like paper clips, sticky notes, and USB drives. This would reduce clutter on the desk and ensure the mouse is always charged and ready to use."
