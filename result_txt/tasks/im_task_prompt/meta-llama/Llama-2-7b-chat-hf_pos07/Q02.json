    "Smart Bike Helmet: Create a smart bike helmet that not only protects the rider's head but also provides real-time traffic updates, navigation, and communication with other cyclists. The helmet could use sensors to detect potential hazards and alert the rider with a vibration or audio signal. Additionally, the helmet could have a built-in camera to record the ride and provide a virtual tour of the route for future reference.",
    "Electric Bike Conversion Kit: Develop a conversion kit that allows owners of traditional bicycles to upgrade to electric-assisted bikes. The kit would include a lightweight battery pack, motor, and control system that can be easily installed on most bicycles. This would provide a more environmentally friendly and convenient alternative to traditional cars or public transportation.",
    "Bicycle-Powered Generator: Create a generator that harnesses the energy produced by a bicycle to generate electricity. The generator could be mounted on the rear wheel of the bicycle and use a combination of gears and magnets to convert the kinetic energy of the wheel into electrical energy. This could be a great solution for off-grid communities or for individuals who want to generate their own electricity.",
    "Bike-Sharing Platform: Develop a bike-sharing platform that allows users to rent bicycles on a pay-per-use basis. The platform could use a combination of GPS tracking and smart locks to ensure that bicycles are securely returned to designated locations after use. This could provide an affordable and convenient transportation option for short distances, reducing traffic congestion and promoting a healthier lifestyle.",
    "Bicycle-Powered Water Purifier: Create a water purifier that uses a bicycle to power a filtration system. The purifier could use a combination of UV light, activated carbon, and ceramic filters to remove impurities from water. The bicycle would be used to power a generator that provides the necessary electricity to run the filtration system. This could provide a sustainable and portable solution for clean drinking water in remote or disaster-stricken areas."
