    "**Weather Conditions**: The weather on Mount Everest can change rapidly, posing serious risks such as blizzards or extreme temperatures. A creative solution would be to develop a mobile app that provides real-time weather updates and forecasts specific to the climbing route. This app could use data from weather satellites and local meteorological stations to help climbers make informed decisions about their ascent.",
    "**Equipment Failure**: Gear failure, such as broken crampons or malfunctioning oxygen systems, can jeopardize a climber's safety. To address this, climbers could participate in pre-climb workshops focused on gear maintenance and repair. Additionally, a portable repair kit with essential tools and spare parts could be provided to each climber, ensuring they are prepared for any equipment issues that may arise.",
    "**Limited Oxygen Supply**: High altitudes result in lower oxygen levels, which can lead to exhaustion and impaired judgment. To tackle this, a system could be developed that allows climbers to monitor their oxygen levels in real-time through a wearable device. This device could also alert climbers when they need to descend or take breaks, ensuring they maintain optimal performance.",
    "**Environmental Impact**: Climbing Mount Everest can lead to significant environmental degradation, including litter and waste. A creative initiative could be the introduction of an \"Everest Clean-Up Challenge,\" where climbers are incentivized to collect waste during their ascent. Participants could earn points for the amount of waste they collect, which could then be redeemed for discounts on gear or future climbing expeditions.",
    "**Communication Barriers**: In remote areas of the mountain, communication can be limited, making it difficult to coordinate with teams or call for help in emergencies. To solve this, a network of satellite phones and walkie-talkies could be established, allowing climbers to stay connected with their teams and base camp. Additionally, training on effective communication strategies in high-stress situations could be provided before the climb."
