    "Smart Ice Cube Tray: Create an ice cube tray with built-in sensors that can detect the temperature and humidity levels in the freezer. When the sensors detect that the ice cubes are melting too quickly, the tray can send a notification to the user's phone to remind them to remove the tray from the freezer. This tray can also have a built-in fan to speed up the cooling process and keep the ice cubes from melting too quickly.",
    "Customizable Ice Cube Tray: Design an ice cube tray with interchangeable molds that can be easily removed and replaced with different shapes and sizes. This would allow users to create unique and personalized ice cubes for their drinks, such as hearts for a romantic dinner or animal shapes for a fun party.",
    "Compact Ice Cube Tray: Create a collapsible ice cube tray that can be easily stored in a small space when not in use. This would be ideal for people who live in small apartments or have limited storage space in their freezer. The tray can be made of a flexible material that can be collapsed and stored in a small container or bag.",
    "Multi-Functional Ice Cube Tray: Design an ice cube tray with multiple functions, such as a built-in strainer or a compartment for storing small utensils like straws or cocktail picks. This would be a practical and space-saving solution for people who entertain frequently and need to store small items in their freezer.",
    "Smart Ice Cube Tray with Health Monitoring: Create an ice cube tray with a built-in health monitoring system that can track the user's water intake and monitor their hydration levels. The tray can have sensors that can detect the user's body temperature and send notifications to their phone or smartwatch if they are not drinking enough water throughout the day. This tray can also have a built-in UV light that can kill bacteria and other microorganisms in the water, making it a healthier and safer option for drinking water."
