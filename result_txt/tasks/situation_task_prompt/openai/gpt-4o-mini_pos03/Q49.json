    "**DIY Fire-Stopper Mixture**: Develop a homemade fire-stop solution using common household ingredients. For example, mix baking soda and vinegar to create a non-toxic, foaming agent that can smother small flames. Store this mixture in spray bottles throughout your home, particularly in high-risk areas like the kitchen. While this won't replace fire extinguishers, it can help manage small fires before they escalate.",
    "**Heat-Reflective Window Film**: Apply a heat-reflective film to your windows. This film can help prevent heat from a nearby fire from entering your home, potentially reducing the risk of ignition. Additionally, consider using window screens made from non-flammable materials to provide an extra layer of protection while allowing ventilation.",
    "**Fire-Resistant Barriers**: Construct temporary barriers using materials like metal sheets, concrete blocks, or even wet burlap sacks. Position these barriers around your homeâ€™s perimeter to deflect heat and flames. This method can be particularly useful in areas prone to wildfires, as it can help protect your home from radiant heat.",
    "**Community Fire Watch Network**: Organize a local fire watch network with neighbors. Create a system for monitoring fire hazards and reporting smoke or flames quickly. This network can also involve regular meetings to share tips on fire prevention and create a community emergency response plan, ensuring everyone knows what to do in case of a fire.",
    "**Portable Fire Shelters**: Design and create portable fire shelters using heat-resistant materials such as aluminum foil and fiberglass blankets. These shelters can be strategically placed around your home or in vulnerable areas like the garage. In the event of an approaching fire, these can provide temporary refuge for pets or essential belongings until help arrives."
