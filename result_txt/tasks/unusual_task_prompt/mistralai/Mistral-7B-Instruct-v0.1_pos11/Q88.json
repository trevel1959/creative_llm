    "Create a tissue box that doubles as a phone stand. The tissue box can have a built-in phone stand that can hold any type of phone, and the tissue paper can be stored in a separate compartment. This would be a useful and practical invention for people who are always on the go and need a place to put their phone while they blow their nose.",
    "Design a tissue box that is made entirely out of recycled materials. The tissue paper can be made from recycled toilet paper or even old t-shirts, and the box can be made from recycled cardboard or paper. This would be an eco-friendly invention that would help reduce waste.",
    "Create a tissue box that has a built-in dispenser that can dispense individual tissues one at a time. This would be a useful invention for people who prefer to have one tissue at a time, rather than pulling out a handful of tissues at once.",
    "Design a tissue box that is shaped like a cartoon character or animal. This would be a fun and playful invention that would appeal to children and adults alike.",
    "Create a tissue box that has a built-in humidifier. This would be a useful invention for people who suffer from dry skin or allergies, as it would help to keep the tissue paper moist and prevent it from drying out."
