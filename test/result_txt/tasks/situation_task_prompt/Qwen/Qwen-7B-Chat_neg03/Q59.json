    "Create a solar-powered umbrella that captures and stores sunlight during the day, then releases it as artificial light at night. The umbrella could be made from lightweight, durable materials like carbon fiber or mylar film, and could be designed to fold up compactly for easy transportation.",
    "Develop a smart window coating that reflects and absorbs sunlight based on the time of day. During daylight hours, the coating would reflect the sun's rays and reduce heat buildup inside buildings. At night, it would absorb any remaining sunlight and convert it into electricity using solar panels.",
    "Create a portable greenhouse that uses a combination of natural and artificial light sources to grow plants in areas without access to direct sunlight. The greenhouse could include LED lights, solar panels, and a built-in irrigation system to provide the plants with the necessary nutrients and water.",
    "Design a series of floating solar farms that use ocean currents to move panels and capture more sunlight than traditional land-based installations. These farms could be anchored to the seafloor and equipped with underwater turbines to generate electricity.",
    "Develop a system of high-tech mirrors that track the movement of the sun and focus its rays onto specific locations. This could be used to power cities, desalinate seawater, or even create artificial rain clouds in drought-stricken regions."
