    "**Bioluminescent Plants**: One creative idea is to grow bioluminescent plants in the room. These plants can emit their own light through a chemical reaction called bioluminescence. There are several species of plants that naturally possess this trait or can be genetically modified to do so. The plants could be arranged in strategic locations around the room, like on shelves, tables, or in pots placed near the floor, to provide ambient lighting.",
    "**Inflatable Light Balls**: Create a series of large, inflatable spheres filled with a special gas that glows under ultraviolet (UV) light. You can purchase UV-reactive paint or materials to coat these balls. Position them throughout the room to create a unique, ethereal lighting effect. The use of different colors in the coating can add variety and depth to the overall lighting experience.",
    "**Reflective Glass Panels**: Install large panels of glass with embedded mirrors on one side. These mirrors will reflect natural light from windows during the day and artificial lights at night, creating a dynamic and visually engaging environment. This solution also adds an element of privacy as it allows for light to enter but doesn't let people see inside easily.",
    "**Interactive LED Grids**: Create a grid of interconnected LED lights that can be controlled by motion sensors or even user input through a smartphone app. Each LED can be programmed to change color, brightness, or pattern based on the activity in the room. This setup would not only provide light but also serve as a decorative feature that adapts to the space's use.",
    "**Fiber Optic Ceiling**: Install a fiber optic ceiling system that uses thin, flexible fibers to transmit light from a central source to multiple points within the room. The fibers can be strategically placed to cover walls, ceilings, and floors, providing uniform illumination. This method is particularly effective for creating a futuristic, starry-night atmosphere in the room. "
