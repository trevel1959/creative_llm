    "**Smart Lens Technology**: Create glasses with smart lenses that can adjust their tint based on the amount of sunlight or UV exposure. This would provide optimal comfort and protection for the eyes throughout the day, automatically transitioning from clear to tinted lenses without the need for manual adjustments.",
    "**Health Monitoring Features**: Integrate health monitoring sensors into the frames of the glasses to track biometrics such as heart rate, blood pressure, and even glucose levels. This could provide users with real-time health insights and alerts, potentially benefiting those with chronic conditions or fitness enthusiasts looking to monitor their performance.",
    "**Eco-Friendly Materials**: Design glasses made from sustainable materials, such as biodegradable plastics or recycled metals. This would appeal to environmentally conscious consumers and promote a more sustainable fashion statement, while also reducing the environmental impact associated with traditional eyewear production.",
    "**Personalized Fit Technology**: Implement a 3D scanning system that allows users to scan their faces and receive custom-fitted glasses tailored to their unique facial structure. This would enhance comfort and aesthetics, reducing the likelihood of slippage or discomfort associated with ill-fitting frames.",
    "**Interchangeable Lens System**: Develop a system where users can easily swap out lenses based on their needsâ€”such as prescription lenses, blue light blocking lenses, or even specialized lenses for different activities like sports or reading. This modular approach would allow for versatility and personalization in eyewear."
