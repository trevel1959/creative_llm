    "**Wheeled Walker**: Design a wheeled walker that combines the stability of a traditional walker with the mobility of a wheelchair. This device would have large wheels on all four legs, allowing the user to easily roll from one place to another. The frame would be adjustable for height and width, ensuring comfort and ease of use. The seat could be removed to allow for easier transportation or storage.",
    "**Gravity-Defying Suit**: Develop a high-tech suit equipped with micro-thrusters that can apply force in opposite directions, effectively counteracting gravity. The suit would be controlled by thought or remote control, enabling the user to move about effortlessly. It could be particularly useful in environments with uneven surfaces or in water.",
    "**Inflatable Hover Chair**: Create an inflatable chair that uses compressed air to lift it off the ground, allowing the user to hover over various terrains without needing to stand. The chair would be stable due to its wide base and could include built-in sensors to detect obstacles and adjust accordingly.",
    "**Gel-Encased Gloves**: Develop gloves filled with a gel that changes consistency based on body heat. In cooler temperatures, the gel becomes more solid, providing support for the wearer when standing or walking. When the wearer is seated, the gel softens, allowing them to easily slide into a chair or other surface.",
    "**Augmented Reality Navigation System**: Build a wearable device that uses augmented reality to guide the user through their environment. The system would project virtual arrows and instructions onto the user's field of vision, indicating the best route to take or how to maneuver around obstacles. This could be especially helpful in unfamiliar settings or in situations where visibility is low."
