They would not only provide shade but also improve air quality and promote biodiversity, making cities more livable.",
    "**Smart Cooling Zones**: Implement smart cooling zones in urban areas equipped with advanced misting systems, shade sails, and seating areas. These zones would use sensors to detect temperature and humidity, automatically adjusting misting levels to keep the area cool. The zones could be designed to encourage social interaction, featuring seating and charging stations for devices.",
    "**Portable Shade Devices**: Create a line of stylish, portable shade devices that people can carry with them. These could be lightweight, foldable screens that can be set up anywhere, featuring designs that reflect personal style.
