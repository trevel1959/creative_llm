    "**Multi-Functional Knife with Modular Blades**: Create a knife with interchangeable blades that can be easily swapped out depending on the task at hand. For instance, a chef's knife blade could be replaced with a serrated blade for bread, a paring knife for fruits, or a cleaver for meats. The handle could have a locking mechanism to ensure safety and stability while using different blades.",
    "**Ergonomic Knife with Adaptive Grip**: Design a knife that features an adaptive grip that molds to the user's hand for maximum comfort and control. The handle could be made of a memory foam-like material that adjusts to the user's grip, reducing strain during extended use. Additionally, the knife could have adjustable weight distribution to cater to personal preferences.",
    "**Self-Sharpening Knife**: Innovate a knife that includes a self-sharpening mechanism built into the handle. As the knife is sheathed or unsheathed, a small ceramic sharpening stone could automatically sharpen the blade, ensuring that it remains razor-sharp with minimal effort. This would be especially beneficial for busy kitchens where time is of the essence.",
    "**Knife with Built-in Safety Features**: Develop a knife that incorporates safety features such as a retractable blade that only extends when pressure is applied to the handle, similar to a pressure-sensitive switch. Additionally, the knife could have a safety lock that prevents accidental opening or closing, making it ideal for households with children.",
    "**Knife with Augmented Reality (AR) Cooking Assistant**: Create a knife that comes with a companion AR headset or app that provides visual guides and tutorials while cooking. The knife could have an embedded camera that recognizes ingredients and suggests recipes or techniques in real-time. This could revolutionize cooking by offering hands-free assistance and improving culinary skills."
