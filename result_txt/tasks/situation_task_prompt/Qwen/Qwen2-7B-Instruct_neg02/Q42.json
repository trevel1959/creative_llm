    "**Innovative Water Collection System:** You could construct a system to collect and purify water using natural materials available on the island. For example, create a series of large, woven baskets filled with sand or gravel that catch rainwater. The sand filters out debris, and the gravel helps with sedimentation. After collecting enough water, use a natural purification method like boiling over an open fire, or use plants known for their water-purifying properties like sedge grasses or willow branches.",
    "**Sustainable Food Sources:** Identify edible plants, fruits, nuts, and roots by learning about the island's flora. Use tools like sticks or rocks to dig for edible tubers and roots. Learn to fish with simple tools like hooks made from sharpened sticks, nets created from vines, or spears crafted from sturdy wood. Set up traps for small animals such as crabs, birds, or insects.",
    "**Emergency Signaling Device:** Create a large signal fire that can be seen from a distance during the day or night. Use a combination of materials like palm fronds, coconut husks, and resinous tree sap to ensure it burns long. Alternatively, build a reflective device using mirrors or polished stones found on the beach to send light signals. Establish a signal pattern in advance, so any passing ships or planes know how to respond.",
    "**Self-Sustaining Shelter:** Construct a shelter using locally available materials like bamboo, palm leaves, and vines. Build a frame using strong, flexible branches, then cover it with leafy branches and palm fronds to provide shade and protection from the elements. Ensure the shelter is elevated above ground level to avoid moisture and potential animal intruders. Reinforce the structure with additional branches and vines for stability.",
    "**Survival Kit from Found Materials:** Gather essential survival items from around the island using what you find. Collect tools like knives, hammers, and chisels by sharpening rocks, bones, or shells. Store these tools in a waterproof container made from coconut shells or a hollowed-out log. Include other items like a first aid kit (using bandages, herbs, and natural antiseptics), a whistle or signaling mirror, a map or compass (if you can find one), and a journal to document your experiences and communicate with rescuers."
