    "**Backwards Bicycle**: A specially designed bicycle that can only be pedaled in reverse. The frame would be built to allow the rider to sit comfortably while pedaling backwards. The handlebars would be positioned in such a way that the rider can steer effectively while looking over their shoulder. This bike could have a rear-view mirror system to help navigate obstacles, and the pedals would be designed to provide efficient backward propulsion.",
    "**Retro Walking Shoes**: These shoes would be equipped with a built-in gyroscope and sensors that help the wearer walk backwards safely. The soles would be designed with extra grip and cushioning to support the unique movement pattern. Additionally, the shoes could feature a small display that provides real-time feedback on the safest path to take, as well as alerts for nearby obstacles, allowing the wearer to move confidently and efficiently.",
    "**Backtrack Hoverboard**: A hoverboard that can only move in reverse. This device would use advanced propulsion technology to allow smooth backward gliding. It would have sensors that detect the rider's movements and adjust speed accordingly. The hoverboard would come with a built-in GPS system that allows users to plot out routes, ensuring they can navigate their surroundings without turning around. The design could also include LED lights that illuminate the path behind them for better visibility.",
    "**Reverse Segway**: A modified Segway that operates exclusively in reverse. This would involve a re-engineered control system that allows the rider to lean backward to accelerate and lean forward to decelerate. The handlebars would have a unique design to facilitate this backward motion while maintaining balance. This vehicle could also include a built-in screen that displays a rear-view camera feed, helping riders navigate through crowds and tight spaces.",
    "**Backward Skateboard with Propulsion**: A skateboard that features a propulsion system, allowing the rider to move backward without having to push off the ground. The skateboard would be equipped with a small motor that can be controlled via a handheld remote or through foot pressure sensors. The design would ensure that the rider can maintain their balance while moving backward, and the board would be fitted with lights and reflectors for safety during nighttime rides."
