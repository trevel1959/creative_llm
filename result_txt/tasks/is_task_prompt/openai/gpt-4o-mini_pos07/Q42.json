Climbing to the highest peak, she found the sun nestled among the clouds, dreaming of far-off lands. She whispered, “Dear Sun, your snoring wakes the world!” The sun opened one eye and chuckled, “I dream of adventures, but my dreams are too big!” Inspired, Lila invited the sun to share its dreams with the village.

    "The Snoring Sun had a peculiar habit: it would only shine brightly when it was deeply asleep. One fateful day, the Moon grew jealous of the sun’s popularity and decided to steal its snoring blanket. Without it, the sun’s rays dimmed, leaving the world in shadow. Realizing its mistake, the Moon returned the blanket, but not before the sun awoke in a sleepy haze. With a hearty yawn, the sun’s snoring filled the sky, awakening colors that hadn’t been seen in ages. The Moon learned that sharing the night with the sun’s snoring brought balance, and they became friends, each shining in their own time.",

As the sun nestled into the soft pillow, it drifted into a deeper sleep, and the dreams spilled out like colors on a canvas. The stars, delighted, began to dance, creating a mesmerizing light show that delighted the kingdom. From then on, the sun’s snoring became a harmonious part of the night, inspiring dreams for all.",

With teamwork, they climbed the tallest tree and retrieved the blanket from a mischievous cloud. Once cozy again, the sun’s snoring returned to its gentle melody, bringing peace and warmth back to the earth."
