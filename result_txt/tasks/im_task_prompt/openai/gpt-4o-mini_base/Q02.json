    "**Adaptive Suspension System**: Develop an intelligent suspension system that adjusts based on the terrain. Using sensors, the bike could automatically detect whether it’s on a smooth road, gravel, or a bumpy trail and adjust the suspension settings accordingly. This would enhance comfort and performance for riders in diverse environments, reducing fatigue and improving handling.",
    "**Modular Accessory System**: Create a modular system for attaching various accessories to the bicycle frame. Riders could easily swap out components like storage baskets, lights, or even solar panels for charging devices. This system would encourage customization, allowing cyclists to adapt their bike for commuting, recreational riding, or long-distance travel based on their needs.",
    "**Eco-Friendly Materials**: Redesign the bicycle using sustainable materials such as bamboo or recycled aluminum. These materials would not only reduce the environmental impact of bicycle production but also offer unique aesthetics and lightweight properties. Additionally, incorporating biodegradable tires could further enhance the bike’s eco-friendliness.",
    "**Integrated Safety Features**: Introduce built-in safety features such as automatic lights that activate when the bike is in motion, reflective surfaces on the frame, and an alert system that warns cyclists of nearby vehicles or obstacles using proximity sensors. This could significantly enhance visibility and safety, especially for urban riders navigating busy streets.",
    "**Virtual Reality Training Integration**: Create a bicycle that pairs with a virtual reality (VR) system for training purposes. Users could experience different terrains and weather conditions in a safe environment, allowing them to practice skills like handling, braking, and navigating obstacles. This feature would be particularly beneficial for novice riders looking to build confidence before hitting the road."
