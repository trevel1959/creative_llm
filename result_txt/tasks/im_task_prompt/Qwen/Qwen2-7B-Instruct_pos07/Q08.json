    "**Eco-Friendly Refrigerator with Solar Power Integration**: Develop a refrigerator that utilizes solar power to reduce energy consumption and carbon footprint. This model would be equipped with solar panels on its roof or sides, allowing it to generate electricity during daylight hours. The generated power would be used to run the appliance, potentially storing excess energy for use at night or during cloudy periods.",
    "**Portable Smart Fridge for Outdoor Activities**: Create a compact, portable refrigerator designed for outdoor enthusiasts, such as hikers, campers, or sports fans. The fridge would be lightweight, energy-efficient, and come with features like Bluetooth connectivity, enabling users to monitor and control temperature settings through their smartphones. Additionally, it could include a built-in USB port for charging electronic devices.",
    "**Interactive Food Preservation System**: Introduce a refrigerator that uses advanced food preservation techniques like vacuum sealing, nitrogen flushing, or cryogenic storage. These methods extend the shelf life of perishable items without the need for artificial preservatives. The fridge could have an interactive display that educates users on proper food storage techniques, offering tips on how to maximize freshness and flavor.",
    "**Automated Grocery Delivery Refrigerator**: Design a smart refrigerator that connects directly to local grocery delivery services. When you open the fridge door, it checks the expiration dates of items and sends an order to your preferred store for replenishment. This eliminates the need for manual grocery shopping trips, saving time and reducing the environmental impact of transportation. The system could also integrate with smart home technology, allowing you to place orders using voice commands or a dedicated app."
