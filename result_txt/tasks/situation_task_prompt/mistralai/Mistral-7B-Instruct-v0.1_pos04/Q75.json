    "Solar Powered Cars: If all the world's oil disappeared, we could solar power to power our vehicles. Solar panels could be installed on the roofs of cars, which would harness the power of the sun to charge the batteries of the vehicle. This would the need for gasoline or diesel fuel, making our cars more eco-friendly.",
    "Electric Vehicles: Another option would be to rely on electric vehicles. These vehicles can be charged using renewable energy sources such as wind or solar power. Electric vehicles emit less pollution and are more efficient than traditional gasoline-powered cars.",
    "Hydrogen Fuel Cell Cars: Hydrogen fuel cell cars are another alternative to traditional gasoline-powered cars. These cars use hydrogen fuel cells to generate electricity, which powers the vehicle. The hydrogen fuel cells can be refueled using renewable energy sources such as wind or solar power.",
    "Battery-Powered Bikes: Battery-powered bikes are another option for transportation. These bikes are powered by rechargeable batteries and can be charged using renewable energy sources such as solar power. Battery-powered bikes are more efficient than traditional gasoline-powered bikes and emit less pollution.",
    "Hybrid Vehicles: Hybrid vehicles are another option for transportation. These vehicles use a combination of electricity and gasoline to power the vehicle. Hybrid vehicles emit less pollution than traditional gasoline-powered cars and are more efficient."
