    "Insect-repelling plants: One creative solution to deal with pests like insects if all animals disappeared is to utilize plants that have natural insect-repelling properties. For instance, basil, mint, and lemongrass are known to repel mosquitoes, while lavender and chamomile can keep flies away. By incorporating these plants into their gardens, people could naturally repel pests without resorting to harmful chemicals.",
    "Insect-catching robots: Another idea is to develop small, autonomous robots that can capture and dispose of insects. These robots could be powered by solar energy and equipped with sensors to detect and track insect movements. With the ability to capture and remove pests, people could rest easy knowing their homes and gardens are free of unwanted visitors.",
    "Insect-deterrent clothing: Insects could be kept at bay with clothing designed to repel them. Special fabrics with built-in insect-repelling properties could be developed, such as clothing made from cotton infused with citronella oil or treated with permethrin. This would allow people to enjoy the outdoors without worrying about insect bites or stings.",
    "Insect-attracting drones: An alternative approach to dealing with pests could be to use drones that attract and trap insects. These drones could be designed to mimic the scent or sound of a particular insect species, luring them in and trapping them within the drone's body. Once full, the drone could be easily disposable, eliminating the need for chemical pesticides.",
    "Insect-inspired building materials: For a more sustainable solution, people could look to nature for inspiration when it comes to building materials. Insect-inspired materials, such as a building insulation made from a mixture of sand and crushed silkworm shells, could provide effective pest control while also being environmentally friendly. By mimicking the structure and properties of insect exoskeletons, engineers could develop materials that are both durable and insect-repellent, reducing the need for chemical pesticides and providing a more sustainable solution."
