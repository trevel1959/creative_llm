    "**Multi-Function Bell with LED Alerts**: Create a bicycle bell that incorporates LED lights that can change color or flash patterns based on the situation. For instance, a steady blue light could indicate the rider is traveling at a safe speed, while a flashing red light could signal that the cyclist is stopping or slowing down. This feature would enhance visibility and communication with other road users, particularly at night.",
    "**Sustainable Solar-Powered Bell**: Design a bicycle bell that is powered by solar energy. This bell would have a small solar panel integrated into its design, allowing it to charge during the day while riding. This eco-friendly option would eliminate the need for batteries, making it more sustainable and reducing waste. Additionally, it could include a small battery reserve for nighttime use.",
    "**Sound Personalization with Vibration Feedback**: Introduce a bell that allows users to select different sounds based on their preference or situation. The bell could have a vibration feature that provides tactile feedback when the bell is rung, alerting the rider that the bell is activated. This would be especially useful in noisy environments where the sound might not be heard, ensuring that the cyclist is aware theyâ€™ve signaled.",
    "**Interactive Bell with Voice Commands**: Innovate a bicycle bell that responds to voice commands. Cyclists could say commands like \"ring,\" \"alert,\" or \"stop,\" and the bell would activate accordingly. This hands-free feature would allow riders to keep their hands on the handlebars while still being able to signal their presence. Additionally, it could have a voice feedback system that acknowledges the command.",
    "**Bicycle Bell with Built-in GPS Tracker**: Combine a bicycle bell with a GPS tracking system that helps locate the bicycle in case of theft. The bell could emit a loud alarm if someone tries to tamper with the bike, and the owner could track its location through an app. This would provide an extra layer of security for cyclists and peace of mind while parked in public areas."
