    "**Self-Cleaning Hairbrush**: Design a hairbrush with a self-cleaning mechanism. This could involve a detachable bristle head that can be easily removed and cleaned with a built-in UV light that sterilizes the bristles after each use. Alternatively, a small vacuum mechanism could remove hair strands and debris from the bristles, ensuring the brush stays clean without the hassle of manual cleaning.",
    "**Interchangeable Bristle Technology**: Create a hairbrush with interchangeable bristle heads that can be swapped out depending on the hair type and styling needs. For instance, users could choose from bristles designed for detangling, smoothing, or styling. This would make the hairbrush versatile, catering to different hair types and styles, and reducing the need for multiple brushes.",
    "**Ergonomic and Adjustable Handle**: Design an ergonomic hairbrush with an adjustable handle that can change shape or length based on user preference. This would provide better grip and comfort during use, especially for those with wrist issues or those who brush their hair for extended periods. The handle could also include a built-in massager to stimulate the scalp and enhance circulation.",
    "**Thermal Hairbrush**: Develop a hairbrush that incorporates heating technology, allowing users to style their hair while brushing. The brush could heat up to a safe temperature, helping to smooth frizz and enhance shine as users brush their hair. It could also feature adjustable temperature settings to accommodate different hair types and styling needs.",
    "**Eco-Friendly Hairbrush**: Create a hairbrush made entirely from sustainable materials, such as bamboo or recycled plastics. This hairbrush could also include biodegradable bristles, reducing plastic waste. Additionally, a portion of the sales could go towards environmental conservation efforts, making it an eco-conscious choice for consumers who care about the planet."
