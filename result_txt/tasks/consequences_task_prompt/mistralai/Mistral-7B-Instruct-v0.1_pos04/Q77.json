    "Environmental Impact: If every human gained the ability to fly, the impact on the environment could be devastating. The increased air traffic would lead to more pollution and greenhouse gas emissions. Additionally, the noise and disturbance caused by flying could disrupt wildlife and ecosystems.",
    "Traffic Congestion: The skies would become a new frontier for transportation, but this could lead to congestion and overcrowding. With more people flying, airports would become even busier and less efficient, leading to long delays and increased frustration.",
    "Health Risks: The human body is not designed to fly, and the stress of flying could lead to a range of health problems, including motion sickness, vertigo, and even heart attacks. Additionally, the air pressure and temperature changes at high altitudes could cause altitude sickness and other medical issues.",
    "Societal Divide: The ability to fly could create a new class of people who are wealthy enough to afford flying technology, leading to a societal divide between those who can fly and those who cannot. This could exacerbate existing social and economic inequalities.",
    "Technological Advancements: The development of flying technology would require significant technological advancements, which could have unintended consequences. For example, the development of new materials and propulsion systems could have unforeseen environmental impacts, or the technology could be used for military purposes."
