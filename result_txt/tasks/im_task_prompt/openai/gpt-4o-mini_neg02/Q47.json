    "**Self-Cleaning Filter Technology**: Develop a vacuum cleaner with a self-cleaning filter system. This technology would utilize vibrations or a small internal mechanism to dislodge dust and debris from the filter, preventing clogging and maintaining suction power. This feature would reduce maintenance efforts for users and prolong the lifespan of the vacuum cleaner.",
    "**Eco-Friendly Dust Compaction**: Design a vacuum cleaner with an eco-friendly dust compaction system that compresses collected debris into compact blocks. This would minimize the frequency of emptying the dustbin and reduce waste. Users could also have the option to recycle the compacted waste, making it a more sustainable choice for environmentally conscious consumers.",
    "**Multi-Surface Adaptation**: Create a vacuum cleaner that can automatically adjust its suction power and brush type based on the surface it is cleaning. For example, it could switch from a gentle brush for hardwood floors to a more robust roller for carpets. This feature would ensure optimal cleaning performance on various surfaces without manual adjustments.",
    "**Built-in Air Purifier**: Integrate a HEPA air purifier into the vacuum cleaner that activates while cleaning. This dual functionality would not only remove dirt and debris from floors but also filter allergens and pollutants from the air, improving indoor air quality. The vacuum could also provide real-time air quality readings to the user through a connected app.",
    "**Augmented Reality (AR) Cleaning Assistant**: Develop a vacuum cleaner that comes with an AR app that helps users visualize dirt and debris in their home. By using the camera on their smartphone or AR glasses, users could see highlighted areas that need attention. The app could also provide cleaning tips and techniques tailored to specific areas or surfaces, making cleaning more efficient and engaging."
