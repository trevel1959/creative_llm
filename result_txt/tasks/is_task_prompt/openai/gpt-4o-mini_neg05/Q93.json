    "In a lush green meadow, a boastful hare challenged all creatures to a race. A humble snail, known for her slow pace but unwavering determination, accepted the challenge. The day of the race arrived, and the hare dashed ahead, laughing at the snailâ€™s sluggishness. Confident of victory, he took a nap under a shady tree. Meanwhile, the snail, inching forward with steady persistence, never lost sight of the finish line. When the hare awoke, he sprinted to the finish, only to find the snail crossing it just ahead. The meadow erupted in cheers, and the hare learned that slow and steady truly wins the race.",
