    "Use natural elements: If all jewels and precious metals disappeared, we could still create valuable ornaments using natural elements such as stones, shells, and driftwood. These materials can be arranged in unique and aesthetically pleasing ways to create beautiful pieces of jewelry that are both functional and artistic.",
    "Recycle materials: Another option would be to recycle old or discarded materials to create new ornaments. This could include repurposing old clothing, paper, or even plastic bottles into unique pieces of jewelry.",
    "Use 3D printing: With the advancements in 3D printing technology, we could create intricate and complex ornaments using materials such as plastic or resin. These ornaments could be designed to resemble traditional jewels and precious metals, or they could be entirely original creations.",
    "Incorporate technology: We could also use technology to create valuable ornaments. For example, we could use LED lights or other electronic components to create unique and colorful pieces of jewelry that are both functional and visually stunning.",
