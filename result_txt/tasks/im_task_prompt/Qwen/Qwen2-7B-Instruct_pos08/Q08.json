    "**Innovative Cooling Technology Challenge**: Create a refrigerator that uses renewable energy sources, like solar or wind power, to reduce its carbon footprint. This innovative idea can include an integrated system that stores excess energy from renewable sources when not in use. It could also incorporate smart technology to optimize energy consumption based on usage patterns.",
    "**Smart Storage Solution Challenge**: Design a refrigerator that uses AI and machine learning algorithms to predict food expiration dates and suggest recipes based on inventory. The fridge could also automatically reorder groceries when supplies are low and send notifications to your smartphone. This would help users manage their food better, reducing waste and saving money.",
    "**Health and Wellness Enhancement Challenge**: Develop a refrigerator that integrates with health monitoring devices. It could monitor the quality of stored food and alert you if the conditions are not optimal for preserving nutrients. Additionally, it could suggest meal plans tailored to your dietary preferences and restrictions, helping users maintain a healthy lifestyle.",
    "**Eco-Friendly Packaging Challenge**: Focus on creating a refrigerator that supports sustainable packaging practices. The design could include compartments that separate food waste by type (compostable, recyclable, etc.), making it easier for consumers to recycle or compost. Moreover, the fridge could be constructed using eco-friendly materials, such as recycled plastics or bamboo, further reducing its environmental impact.",
    "**Flexible Storage Space Challenge**: Create a modular refrigerator that allows users to customize the storage space according to their needs. This could involve adjustable shelves, sliding drawers, and specialized compartments for different types of food items. For example, one drawer could be designed for keeping fruits and vegetables fresh, while another could be optimized for storing beverages at the perfect temperature. This adaptable design would offer more efficient and personalized storage solutions."
