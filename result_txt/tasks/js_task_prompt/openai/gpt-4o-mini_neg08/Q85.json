    "**Curiosity as a Default State**: I would alter human nature to prioritize curiosity as a fundamental trait. Instead of settling into complacency or resistance to change, people would naturally seek to explore new ideas, cultures, and experiences. This heightened curiosity would lead to innovation, empathy, and understanding across diverse communities. It would also help individuals to see the value in learning from others, reducing jealousy by transforming it into admiration for different paths and experiences.",
    "**Innate Gratitude**: Imagine if gratitude was an inherent trait in all humans. By changing human nature to include a natural inclination towards gratitude, individuals would find joy in their circumstances and appreciate the small victories in life. This shift would diminish feelings of jealousy, as people would focus on what they have rather than what others possess. A culture of gratitude would enhance mental well-being, promote kindness, and create a more harmonious society where everyone feels valued.",
    "**Collective Success Mindset**: I would change human nature to embrace a collective success mindset, where individuals inherently recognize that the success of one person contributes to the success of the community. This perspective would shift the focus from individual achievements to shared accomplishments. In this environment, jealousy would be replaced by a sense of belonging and teamwork, encouraging collaboration and the pooling of talents and resources for the greater good.",
    "**Empathy as a Default Response**: I would enhance human nature by making empathy an automatic response. This change would allow individuals to instinctively understand and share the feelings of others, reducing jealousy by fostering compassion and connection. When people can easily empathize with others’ struggles and successes, they are less likely to feel threatened or envious. This shift would cultivate deeper relationships and a more supportive social fabric, where individuals uplift one another rather than compete.",
    "**Growth Mindset Instinct**: I would instill a growth mindset as a core aspect of human nature, making individuals inherently believe that abilities and intelligence can be developed through effort and learning. This change would minimize feelings of jealousy because individuals would view others’ successes as evidence of potential rather than as a fixed comparison. Instead of feeling inadequate, people would be motivated to learn from those they admire, leading to a culture of mentorship and continuous improvement."
