    "Leak Detection System: We can install a leak detection system within the garden hose that can identify leaks in real-time. When a leak is detected, the system can send an alert to the user, along with precise information on the location of the leak. This innovation will help prevent water wastage and save money on water bills.",
    "Adjustable Water Flow: By adding a variable speed control mechanism to the garden hose, users can adjust the water flow according to their requirements. This will allow them to water plants with precision and avoid overwatering or under-watering.",
    "UV Protection: To protect the garden hose from sun damage and extend its life, we can incorporate UV-resistant coating. This coating can be applied to the hose's surface, making it resistant to fading and cracking caused by sunlight.",
    "Water-saving Features: We can integrate rain sensors into the garden hose to detect rainfall, thus automatically stopping the water flow to prevent wastage. Additionally, we can add a water timer that can be set to a specific duration, allowing users to set a precise watering schedule for their plants.",
    "Smart Watering System: Instead of a traditional garden hose, we can develop a smart watering system that can be operated through a mobile app. This system can be connected to the homeowner's Wi-Fi network, allowing remote control of the watering schedule, water flow, and real-time monitoring of irrigation."
