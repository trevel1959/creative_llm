    "**Smart Hairbrush for Health Monitoring**: Design a hairbrush that can monitor hair health by analyzing the condition of hair strands and scalp through infrared or ultrasonic technology. It could detect signs of hair damage, scalp issues, or even signs of stress on the body, sending alerts to the user's smartphone or a dedicated app. This tool could be especially beneficial for those with sensitive scalps or conditions like alopecia.",
    "**Interactive Hairbrush for Children**: Create an educational hairbrush that doubles as a toy, designed specifically for children. The handle would feature colorful buttons or a touchscreen interface that plays educational games, tells stories, or teaches children about hair care routines when brushing their hair. This not only makes hair grooming a fun activity but also promotes learning.",
    "**Heated Hairbrush for Styling**: Develop a hairbrush that includes heating elements, making it suitable for straightening, smoothing, or styling hair without the need for additional flat irons or curling wands. The brush could have adjustable heat settings, ensuring users can achieve their desired style while minimizing heat damage to their hair.",
    "**Detangling Hairbrush with Memory Function**: Design a hairbrush that automatically learns the userâ€™s hair texture and style preferences over time. It would remember which parts of the hair are prone to tangles and apply more gentle pressure or different types of bristles in those areas. This could significantly reduce the time spent on detangling, making the grooming process faster and less painful.",
    "**Wireless Charging Hairbrush Stand**: In addition to its primary function, create a hairbrush stand that can wirelessly charge compatible electronic devices (such as smartphones or headphones) when placed on it. This innovative stand would not only serve as a practical accessory for the bathroom but also as a convenient charging station, reducing clutter and adding value to the user's daily routine."
