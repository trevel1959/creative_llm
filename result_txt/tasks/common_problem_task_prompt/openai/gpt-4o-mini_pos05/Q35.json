    "**Visitor Safety**: The safety of visitors is crucial, especially in an environment where wild animals are present. Problems could arise from inadequate barriers or fencing, leading to potential escapes or accidents. Implementing rigorous safety protocols, including regular inspections of enclosures and training staff to manage visitor interactions, can help ensure a secure environment for both animals and guests.",
    "**Financial Sustainability**: Running a zoo can be expensive, with costs for animal care, facility maintenance, and staff salaries. If visitor numbers decline or funding is cut, the zoo may face financial challenges. To address this, zoos can diversify their revenue streams by offering unique experiences, such as behind-the-scenes tours or educational programs, and partnering with local businesses for sponsorships.",
    "**Conservation Efforts**: Zoos often play a role in conservation, but there can be challenges in balancing entertainment with education and conservation messaging. A problem may arise if visitors perceive the zoo primarily as a place for entertainment rather than a center for wildlife conservation. To counter this, zoos can implement educational programs that highlight their conservation efforts, promote species awareness, and engage visitors in conservation activities.",
    "**Staff Training and Retention**: The quality of care for the animals heavily relies on the expertise and commitment of the staff. Issues can arise from high turnover rates or inadequate training, which can lead to inconsistent care and a lack of knowledge regarding animal behavior. Developing a comprehensive training program, offering competitive salaries, and fostering a positive work environment can help retain skilled staff and ensure high standards of animal care.",
    "**Public Perception and Ethical Considerations**: Zoos face scrutiny regarding the ethics of keeping animals in captivity. Negative public perception can lead to decreased attendance and support. To address this, zoos can focus on transparency, showcasing their conservation efforts, rehabilitation programs, and educational initiatives to demonstrate their commitment to animal welfare and biodiversity."
