    "**Inclusivity and Accessibility**: A new sport should aim to be inclusive and accessible to a diverse range of participants. This means considering different age groups, skill levels, and physical abilities. For instance, the sport could incorporate adaptive equipment for individuals with disabilities, ensuring that everyone has the opportunity to participate. Creating a set of modified rules for different ability levels could also encourage broader participation.",
    "**Marketing and Promotion**: Once the sport is developed, effectively marketing it to attract participants and spectators can be challenging. This involves creating a brand identity, designing promotional materials, and leveraging social media platforms to generate interest. Engaging with local communities and sports organizations can also help to build a following. Without a solid marketing strategy, the sport may struggle to gain traction and recognition.",
    "**Establishing Governing Bodies**: To ensure the sport is taken seriously and to facilitate competitions, it may be necessary to establish a governing body or organization. This body would be responsible for setting official rules, organizing tournaments, and maintaining standards. Challenges may arise in creating a consensus on rules and regulations, especially if the sport evolves over time or if there are differing opinions among early adopters.",
    "**Funding and Sponsorship**: Securing funding to support the development and promotion of the new sport can be a significant hurdle. This may involve seeking sponsorships from businesses, applying for grants, or organizing fundraising events. A lack of financial support can hinder efforts to host events, provide necessary equipment, or pay for marketing initiatives, ultimately affecting the sport's growth and sustainability.",
    "**Cultural Acceptance and Norms**: Introducing a new sport may face resistance from established sports communities or cultural norms that favor traditional sports. Understanding and navigating these dynamics is crucial for the sport's acceptance. This could involve engaging with local sports clubs, schools, and community centers to promote the new sport and demonstrate its benefits, thereby fostering a sense of belonging and enthusiasm."
