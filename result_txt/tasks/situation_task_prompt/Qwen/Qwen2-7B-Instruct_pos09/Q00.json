    "**Human-Powered Vehicles**: In a world where cars are non-functional, people can utilize their own energy to move around. This idea involves inventing or repurposing bicycles, tricycles, unicycles, and even rollerblades for longer distances. For transportation between cities, one could imagine large-scale relay races, with individuals passing off vehicles at designated points. The vehicle design could be lightweight and portable, making it easy to transport when not in use.",
    "**Water-based Transportation**: With the assumption that most cities are located near water bodies, using boats and other watercrafts becomes an essential method of transportation. People could build rafts, canoes, kayaks, or even small motorboats. To facilitate travel between cities, large floating platforms or water taxis could be constructed. This method could also involve the development of underwater tunnels or tubes, allowing for faster and more direct travel under waterways.",
    "**Animal-Assisted Travel**: In this scenario, domesticated animals such as horses, donkeys, and camels could play a crucial role in transportation. These animals could pull carts, wagons, or sleds, depending on the terrain. To ensure efficient travel between cities, a network of animal stables could be established along major routes, providing rest stops and exchanges for weary animals.",
    "**Aerial Lifts and Balloons**: For longer distances, the idea of using balloons and hot air balloons for transportation could be quite effective. These could be used for both short and long-distance travel, with passengers being lifted into the air and carried by wind currents. To facilitate travel between cities, an elaborate system of balloon ports and landing zones could be created, equipped with safety measures and communication systems to ensure smooth transit.",
    "**Innovative Wheelchair Technology**: If the situation involves mobility challenges, especially for those with physical disabilities, the development of advanced wheelchair technology becomes paramount. This could include self-propelled wheelchairs with built-in motors, solar panels for charging, and even robotic arms for assisting with tasks like steering and braking. Additionally, a network of specially designed pathways and ramps could be constructed to accommodate these vehicles, ensuring accessibility across cities."
