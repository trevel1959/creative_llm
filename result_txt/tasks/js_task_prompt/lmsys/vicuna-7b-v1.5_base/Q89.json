    "A language that uses body language: The language would use gestures and body movements to convey meaning, in addition to spoken or written words. For example, a person might raise their arms to indicate \"I love you,\" or nod their head to indicate \"yes.\" This would create a more intuitive and expressive way of communicating.",
    "A language that uses only vowels: The language would only use vowel sounds, with no consonants. This would create a very different sound and feel to the language, and would require speakers to use a different set of sounds to convey meaning.",
    "A language that is entirely visual: The language would use only visual symbols or images to convey meaning, with no spoken or written words. This would create a very different way of communicating, and would require speakers to use a different set of symbols to convey meaning.",
    "A language that uses only onomatopoeic words: The language would use only words that sound like the thing they represent. For example, the word \"buzz\" would sound like a buzzing noise, while the word \"meow\" would sound like a cat's meow. This would create a very playful and expressive way of communicating.",
    "A language that uses only nonsense words: The language would use words that have no meaning in any language, but sound fun or interesting. For example, the word \"flumplenook\" might sound silly, but could be used to describe a strange or unusual object. This would create a very creative and playful way of communicating."
