    "**Liability Issues**: In the event of an accident involving a self-driving car, determining liability can be complex. Is it the manufacturer, the software developer, or the car owner who is responsible? This ambiguity could lead to legal disputes and challenges in insurance coverage, complicating the aftermath of an incident.",
    "**Moral Dilemmas**: Self-driving cars must be programmed to make decisions in emergency situations. For instance, if a collision is unavoidable, should the car prioritize the safety of its passengers over pedestrians? The ethical implications of these programming decisions can lead to public outcry and debates about the moral responsibilities of manufacturers.",
    "**Infrastructure Limitations**: Many cities and regions may not have the necessary infrastructure to support self-driving cars effectively. This includes inadequate road signage, poorly maintained roads, or a lack of smart traffic signals. These limitations could hinder the safe operation of autonomous vehicles, leading to accidents or inefficiencies in traffic flow.",
    "**User Overreliance**: Car owners may become overly reliant on the autonomous features of their self-driving cars, leading to decreased vigilance and attentiveness. This complacency could result in dangerous situations, especially if the technology fails or encounters unexpected scenarios that require human intervention.",
    "**Insurance Adjustments**: The rise of self-driving cars will likely necessitate changes in the insurance industry. Traditional auto insurance models may become obsolete, leading to confusion among consumers about how to insure their vehicles. New policies may need to be developed to address the unique risks associated with autonomous driving, complicating the purchasing process."
