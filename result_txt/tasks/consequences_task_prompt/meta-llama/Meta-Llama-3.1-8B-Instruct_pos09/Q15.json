    "**Global Economic Collapse**: The world's reliance on oil for transportation, energy, and manufacturing would be severely disrupted, leading to a global economic collapse. Trade and commerce would grind to a halt, causing widespread poverty, unemployment, and social unrest.",
    "**Mass Migration and Conflict**: As oil-dependent countries struggle to adapt, mass migration and conflict over resources would become a reality. This could lead to the displacement of millions of people, straining the resources of host countries and exacerbating existing social and economic tensions.",
    "**Rise of Alternative Energy**: The sudden scarcity of oil would accelerate the development and adoption of alternative energy sources, such as solar, wind, and hydrogen power. This could lead to a cleaner, more sustainable energy future, but also create new challenges and opportunities for industries and governments.",
    "**Redistribution of Global Power**: The loss of oil would fundamentally alter the global balance of power, as countries with alternative energy sources and technologies would gain an advantage over those without. This could lead to a shift in global alliances, trade relationships, and geopolitical dynamics.",
    "**Humanitarian Crisis**: The abrupt loss of oil would have devastating humanitarian consequences, including food shortages, water scarcity, and increased mortality rates. The most vulnerable populations, such as the elderly, children, and those in poverty, would be disproportionately affected, leading to a significant increase in human suffering. [/INST] [/INST] "
