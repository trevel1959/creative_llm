    "Indoor Farming: Indoor farming could be scaled up to grow a wide variety of fruits and vegetables year-round. This would allow for the production of large quantities of nutritious food, even if the outdoor environment is not suitable for growing. Indoor farming could also be used to grow fruits and vegetables in areas where the climate is not conducive to outdoor agriculture.",
    "Gene Editing: Using gene editing technology, we could modify existing plants to produce fruits and vegetables with higher nutritional content. This would allow us to maximize the nutritional value of the limited resources available.",
    "Nutrient Recycling: We could develop a system for recycling nutrients from food waste and using them to grow new fruits and vegetables. This would help to reduce food waste and ensure that the nutrients in the food we produce are not wasted.",
    "Nutritional Supplements: Nutritional supplements could be developed to provide all the necessary vitamins and minerals in a convenient and portable form. This would allow people to get the nutrients they need without relying on fruits and vegetables.",
    "Bioengineered Microorganisms: Bioengineered microorganisms could be used to produce vitamins and minerals in large quantities. These microorganisms could be grown in controlled environments and used to produce nutritional supplements."
