    "**Air Purification Functionality**: Design a ceiling fan that includes an air purification system. The fan could have built-in HEPA filters and UV-C light technology that helps to clean the air while circulating it. This dual functionality would not only provide comfort but also promote a healthier living environment, particularly in homes with allergies or respiratory issues.",
    "**Mood Lighting Features**: Incorporate adjustable LED lighting into the fan design that changes color and intensity based on the time of day or user preferences. This could include options for warm, cool, or colorful lighting to set the mood for different activities, such as relaxing, reading, or entertaining. Users could control the lighting through an app or a remote, creating an ambiance that complements their space.",
    "**Blade Design Innovation**: Rethink the traditional blade design by introducing flexible or adjustable blades that can change their angle based on user preference or room layout. This would enhance air circulation efficiency and allow for customization based on seasonal needs—wider angles for summer cooling and tighter angles for winter heating.",
    "**Integrated Sound System**: Create a ceiling fan with an integrated Bluetooth speaker system. This fan could connect to smartphones or other devices, allowing users to enjoy music or podcasts while benefiting from the fan's cooling effect. The speakers could be designed to provide high-quality sound without compromising the aesthetics of the fan.",
    "**Eco-Friendly Materials**: Focus on sustainability by using eco-friendly materials for the fan’s construction, such as recycled metals, bamboo, or biodegradable plastics. Additionally, the fan could be designed for easy disassembly and recycling at the end of its life cycle. Promoting the product as an eco-conscious choice could attract environmentally aware consumers."
