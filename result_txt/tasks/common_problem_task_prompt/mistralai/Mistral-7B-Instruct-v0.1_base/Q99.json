    "**Audio-guided Braille Display:** Develop an audio-guided Braille display that can read aloud the text displayed on the screen, helping visually impaired individuals to understand and read the content. This device would use advanced algorithms to convert digital text into spoken words, making it easier for visually impaired people to navigate websites, read e-books, and access other digital content.",
    "**Virtual Reality Headset:** Create a virtual reality headset that allows visually impaired individuals to experience immersive virtual environments. The headset would use haptic feedback technology to provide tactile cues, allowing users to feel their surroundings and navigate through the virtual world. This technology would enable visually impaired individuals to participate in activities that they may not have been able to do otherwise, such as visiting museums, exploring nature, and attending concerts.",
    "**Smartphone App:** Develop a smartphone app that provides real-time image recognition and description. The app would use advanced computer vision algorithms to recognize objects and scenes in real-time, and then provide a verbal description of what the user is seeing. This app would be particularly useful for visually impaired individuals who rely on their smartphones for navigation and communication.",
    "**Smart Glasses:** Create smart glasses that use augmented reality technology to provide visual cues and assistance to visually impaired individuals. The glasses would overlay digital information onto the user's field of view, providing real-time information about their surroundings. For example, the glasses could provide information about nearby objects, such as their names and locations, or provide directions and navigation assistance.",
    "**3D Printed Objects:** Develop a 3D printing technology that allows visually impaired individuals to create tactile objects that represent digital content. The technology would use a combination of haptic feedback and 3D printing to create objects that can be felt and explored by the user. This technology would be particularly useful for visually impaired individuals who rely on tactile cues to understand and navigate the world around them."
