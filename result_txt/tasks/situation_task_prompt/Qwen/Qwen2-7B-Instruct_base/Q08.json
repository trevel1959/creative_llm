    "**Water Filtration Using Natural Resin**: You could create a system that uses natural resins like wood charcoal or tree bark to filter out impurities from contaminated water. Wood charcoal is effective in removing contaminants due to its porous structure which allows it to adsorb substances. Tree bark, rich in tannins, can also help in purifying water by precipitating out heavy metals and other pollutants.",
    "**Portable Water Purification Units Based on Ultraviolet Light**: This involves creating small, portable devices that use ultraviolet (UV) light to disinfect water. UV light disrupts the DNA of bacteria, viruses, and protozoa, effectively killing them and rendering the water safe for drinking. These units could be powered by rechargeable batteries or solar panels, making them highly portable and sustainable.",
    "**Hybrid Water Treatment Plant**: A hybrid plant could combine various purification methods such as reverse osmosis, UV disinfection, and biological filtration. Reverse osmosis can remove dissolved salts and other contaminants, while UV light ensures microbial safety. Biological filtration using bacteria and fungi could break down organic pollutants further.",
    "**Rainwater Harvesting and Treatment**: In areas with sufficient rainfall, implementing rainwater harvesting systems can provide a reliable source of water. Rainwater collected can be treated through sedimentation, filtration, and sometimes chemical treatments to make it potable. This method not only provides clean water but also reduces the strain on existing water sources.",
    "**Utilizing Algae for Water Purification**: Algae have unique capabilities to remove contaminants from water, including heavy metals, nitrates, and phosphates. They can be grown in tanks where they absorb pollutants through their photosynthetic process. The algae can then be harvested and processed to extract nutrients or used as a biofuel. The treated water is left clean and safe for drinking."
