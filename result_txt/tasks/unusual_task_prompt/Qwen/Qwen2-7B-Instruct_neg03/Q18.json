The umbrella could be made from a new type of fabric that repels both water and UV rays. This would make it ideal for sunny days as well as rainy ones. It could also feature a retractable canopy to provide shade when needed, making it a versatile product for different weather conditions.",

    "**Umbrella-As-A-Service (UaaS) Subscription Model**: Introduce a subscription service where customers pay a monthly fee in exchange for access to high-quality, reusable umbrellas.
