    "Echolocation Sense: This new human sense would allow individuals to navigate and interact with their surroundings through sound waves. It would work by emitting high-frequency sounds through the body, which would then bounce off objects and return to the individual, providing a 3D image of the environment. This sense would be particularly useful for individuals who are visually impaired, allowing them to move around with greater ease and independence.",
    "Thermal Vision Sense: This new human sense would allow individuals to perceive temperature and heat signatures of objects and people around them. It would work by detecting changes in the thermal radiation emitted by objects, allowing individuals to see the temperature of objects and people in their environment. This sense would be useful for a variety of applications, including search and rescue operations, medical diagnosis, and environmental monitoring.",
    "Electromagnetic Sense: This new human sense would allow individuals to perceive electromagnetic fields and energy around them. It would work by detecting changes in the electromagnetic field of objects and people, allowing individuals to sense the presence of electromagnetic energy, such as Wi-Fi signals, cell phone signals, and even the electromagnetic fields of living beings. This sense would be particularly useful for individuals in the fields of technology and engineering, allowing them to better understand and interact with the electromagnetic environment around them.",
    "Time Perception Sense: This new human sense would allow individuals to perceive time in a more nuanced and detailed way. It would work by detecting changes in the molecular structure of the brain, which would allow individuals to sense the passage of time at a molecular level. This sense would be useful for a variety of applications, including understanding the effects of aging, predicting the outcomes of events, and improving the accuracy of clocks and other time-keeping devices.",
    "Synesthesia Sense: This new human sense would allow individuals to experience sensory information from multiple senses simultaneously. For example, an individual with this sense might be able to see colors when they hear music or taste flavors when they hear words. This sense would be particularly useful for artists, musicians, and writers, allowing them to experience their work in a more immersive and creative way. It would also be useful for individuals with sensory processing disorders, allowing them to better integrate and process sensory information"
