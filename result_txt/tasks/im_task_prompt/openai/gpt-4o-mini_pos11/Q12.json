    "**Modular Wallet System**: Design a wallet that can be customized with detachable compartments for different needs. Users can attach or detach sections for cards, cash, coins, or even a power bank for charging devices on the go. This modular approach allows individuals to personalize their wallets according to their daily requirements, keeping everything organized and accessible.",
    "**Integrated RFID Blocker and Tracker**: Enhance the wallet with a built-in RFID blocking layer to protect against electronic pickpocketing. Additionally, incorporate a small tracking device that connects to a smartphone app. If the wallet is misplaced, users can easily locate it using the app, which can show the last known location and even emit a sound to help find it.",
    "**Eco-Friendly Materials with Plant-Based Ink**: Develop a wallet made entirely from sustainable materials, such as recycled plastics or plant-based leather alternatives. The printing on the wallet could use eco-friendly, biodegradable inks. This environmentally conscious design appeals to eco-minded consumers and reduces the carbon footprint associated with traditional wallet manufacturing.",
    "**Wallet with Built-in Solar Charger**: Create a wallet that features a small solar panel on the exterior. This panel can charge a built-in battery that can be used to power small devices like smartphones or Bluetooth trackers. This innovation would be particularly appealing for travelers or outdoor enthusiasts who may not have easy access to power sources.",
    "**Interactive Wallet with E-Ink Display**: Integrate an e-ink display into the wallet that can show customizable information such as a digital ID, loyalty card information, or notifications from a connected app. Users can change the displayed information based on their needs, eliminating the need to carry multiple cards. The e-ink technology is low-power and can last for weeks on a single charge."
