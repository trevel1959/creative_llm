    "Create a community composting program: If all trash cans disappeared, communities could come together to create a centralized composting site where food waste and yard waste could be collected and broken down into nutrient-rich soil. This would reduce the amount of waste that ends up in landfills and provide a valuable resource for local gardens and farms.",
    "Use a \"Pay-as-you-throw\" system: Under this system, residents would pay for the amount of waste they generate, rather than a flat fee for trash collection. This would incentivize people to reduce their waste by using products with less packaging, buying in bulk, and repurposing items whenever possible.",
    "Implement a \"Waste-to-Energy\" program: This program would involve burning non-recyclable waste to produce electricity or heat. This would reduce the amount of waste that ends up in landfills and provide a renewable energy source.",
    "Create a \"Zero-Waste\" store: A store that sells products with minimal packaging or products that can be reused or repurposed could help reduce waste. Customers could bring their reusable containers or bags to fill with products, reducing the need for disposable packaging.",
    "Host community-wide \"Waste Reduction Challenges\": These challenges could involve setting goals for reducing waste in various categories (e.g. plastic, paper, food waste) and encouraging residents to come up with creative solutions to meet those goals. This could foster a sense of community and encourage people to think creatively about waste reduction."
