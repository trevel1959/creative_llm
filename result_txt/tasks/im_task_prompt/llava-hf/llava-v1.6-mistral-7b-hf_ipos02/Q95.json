    "**Laundry Basket with Storage**: Add storage compartments inside the basket to hold laundry supplies such as detergent, fabric softener, and stain remover. This would not only keep the supplies organized but also make it easier to find what you need when doing laundry.",
    "**Laundry Basket with Wheels**: Equip the laundry basket with wheels to make it easier to move around the house. This would be particularly useful when moving the basket to and from the laundry room or the clothesline.",
    "**Laundry Basket with a Built-in Drying Rack**: Combine the laundry basket with a built-in drying rack to streamline the laundry process. This would allow users to wash, rinse, and dry their clothes all in one place, saving time and space.",
    "**Laundry Basket with a Foldable Ironing Board**: Incorporate a foldable ironing board into the design of the laundry basket. This would allow users to iron their clothes directly after washing and drying, eliminating the need to move to a separate ironing station.",
    "**Laundry Basket with a Sorting App**: Develop a mobile app that connects to the laundry basket and provides sorting guidance based on the clothes inside. Users can scan the barcode on their clothes or take a photo, and the app will suggest the correct sorting method for optimal laundry results."
