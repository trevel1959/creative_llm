    "Build an Atmospheric Water Generator: Create a machine that can extract water vapor from the air and condense it into clean drinking water. This machine could be powered by renewable energy sources like solar or wind power, making it a sustainable solution for clean drinking water.",
    "Develop a Water-Harvesting Collar: Create a collar that can be placed around plants or trees, which would collect and store rainwater for use as clean drinking water. This collar could be designed to release the water slowly over time, providing a reliable source of clean drinking water.",
    "Create a Water-Solar Still: Design a still that can capture and purify water vapor from the air using the heat of the sun. This still could be a portable and low-cost solution for obtaining clean drinking water in areas where traditional water sources are polluted.",
    "Invent a Water-Filtration Bottle: Create a water bottle with a built-in filtration system that can remove pollutants and contaminants from any water source. This bottle could be designed to be portable and easy to use, making it a convenient solution for obtaining clean drinking water on the go.",
    "Build an Underground Water Collection System: Create a network of underground tunnels and pipes that can collect and transport clean water from a distant, unpolluted source to a nearby community. This system could be powered by gravity and could provide a reliable source of clean drinking water for a large number of people."
