    "**Smart Temperature Control Electric Kettle**: Develop an electric kettle that has a built-in smart sensor to measure water temperature in real-time. This would allow users to precisely control the temperature of their water for different types of tea or coffee, ensuring optimal brewing conditions every time. The kettle could connect to a smartphone app via Bluetooth, allowing users to adjust settings remotely or save their favorite brewing profiles.",
    "**Voice-Activated Electric Kettle**: Create an electric kettle that can be controlled through voice commands using AI technology. Users could ask the kettle to heat water to a specific temperature, start or stop heating, or even schedule heating times for future use. This feature would make the kettle more user-friendly, especially for those who are visually impaired or have mobility issues.",
    "**Solar-Powered Electric Kettle**: Design an eco-friendly electric kettle that harnesses solar energy to heat water. This kettle would include a solar panel on top, which would charge the internal battery during daylight hours. Once fully charged, the kettle can operate without an electrical outlet, making it ideal for camping, outdoor events, or remote areas where electricity is not readily available.",
    "**Self-Cleaning Electric Kettle**: Introduce an electric kettle equipped with ultrasonic cleaning technology that automatically cleans the interior of the kettle after each use. This feature would help prevent limescale buildup and keep the kettle hygienic, reducing the need for manual cleaning. The self-cleaning function could also be integrated with a smart device to remind users when it's time for a deep clean.",
    "**Customizable Design Electric Kettle**: Offer an electric kettle that allows users to customize its appearance. This could include a range of color options, patterns, or even a personalized engraving service. The customizable design would appeal to individuals who want a unique kitchen appliance that matches their personal style or decor preferences. Additionally, the kettle could have a modular design, allowing users to swap out parts like the handle or base for aesthetic changes or functional upgrades."
