    "**Airboard Surfing**: This new sport combines elements of skateboarding, surfing, and snowboarding on an inflatable board. Riders use a specially designed foot strap system to stay connected to their board as they navigate through the air. The board inflates when a rider jumps or launches off a ramp or a natural feature like a hill. It can be played indoors or outdoors in areas with a suitable height difference.",
    "**Puzzle Chess**: This innovative game merges the strategic elements of chess with the problem-solving aspects of jigsaw puzzles. Each player has a unique puzzle piece set that represents their army, and the objective is to strategically place these pieces on the chessboard to form a complete picture while also capturing the opponent's pieces. The game encourages spatial reasoning, planning, and tactical thinking.",
    "**Gravity-Defying Basketball**: In this game, players compete in a large, enclosed arena filled with various gravity-altering devices. Some areas may experience temporary weightlessness, while others might apply a slight downward pull or reverse gravity for short periods. The goal is to score baskets in a normal gravitational environment while avoiding the adverse effects of the changing gravity settings.",
    "**Virtual Reality Adventure Golf**: This immersive sport takes place entirely within a virtual reality headset. Players explore fantastical landscapes and navigate obstacles using real-world golf clubs and balls. The VR world reacts to each swing, providing a realistic feel and immediate feedback on the success of each shot. Players can compete in single-player missions or team up against AI opponents or other players online.",
    "**Tactile Music Making**: Combining physical interaction with music creation, this sport involves participants creating melodies and rhythms by physically manipulating objects in a special sound chamber. The chamber is equipped with sensors that detect the movement and force applied by the players, translating those actions into audio outputs. The goal is to create harmonious compositions, either individually or in teams, by coordinating movements and efforts."
