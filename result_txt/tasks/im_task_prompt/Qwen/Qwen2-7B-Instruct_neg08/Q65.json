    "**Energy Efficiency**: Create an eco-friendly electric kettle that utilizes advanced heat management technology to reduce energy consumption. It could feature an auto-shutoff timer, smart power-saving modes (like turning off automatically after a certain period), and possibly even a solar charging option for outdoor use.",
    "**Customizable Heating Zones**: Offer a model with adjustable heating zones, enabling users to heat different parts of the water at varying temperatures. This would be particularly useful for tea enthusiasts who require different water temperatures for various types of tea leaves.",
    "**Sustainable Materials**: Use sustainable materials in the construction of the electric kettle, such as bamboo, recycled plastics, or stainless steel with minimal use of non-renewable resources. Additionally, include a recycling program for customers to return old kettles for refurbishment or recycling.",
    "**Visual Appeal**: Design a line of electric kettles with unique, customizable designs that allow users to personalize their kettles. These designs could range from minimalist to highly artistic, including patterns, colors, and even personalized engravings.",
    "**Automated Water Filtration**: Integrate a built-in water filtration system into the kettle, ensuring that the water being boiled is clean and free of impurities. This would be especially beneficial for areas with poor water quality, as it removes contaminants like chlorine, fluoride, and other unwanted substances."
