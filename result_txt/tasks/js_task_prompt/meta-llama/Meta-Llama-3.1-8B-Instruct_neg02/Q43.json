    "**Echo Location**: I'd use this power to create a 3D map of my surroundings by emitting sound waves and analyzing the echoes. This would allow me to navigate complex spaces, detect hidden objects, and even locate people or animals. I could also use this ability to \"see\" through solid objects, allowing me to detect potential hazards or hidden dangers.",
    "**Environmental Monitoring**: I'd use my ability to see through walls to monitor the environment and detect changes in temperature, humidity, and air quality. This would enable me to track the spread of pollutants, detect potential health risks, and even predict natural disasters like earthquakes or floods.",
    "**Artistic Expression**: I'd use my power to create immersive, interactive art installations that allow viewers to experience the world in new and innovative ways. By projecting images or patterns onto walls and surfaces, I could create a new form of experiential art that blurs the boundaries between reality and fantasy.",
    "**Scientific Discovery**: I'd use my ability to see through walls to study the internal structures of buildings, bridges, and other infrastructure, allowing me to identify potential weaknesses and vulnerabilities. This could lead to breakthroughs in materials science, architecture, and engineering, and help us build safer, more resilient structures.",
    "**Mystery Solving**: I'd use my power to investigate crimes and solve mysteries by analyzing the physical evidence left behind at crime scenes. By seeing through walls, I could track the movements of suspects, detect hidden evidence, and even predict the behavior of perpetrators. This would allow me to crack cases that might otherwise go unsolved, bringing justice to victims and their families."
