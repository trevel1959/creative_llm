    "**Scented Candle Integration**: Create a unique line of perfume bottles that double as decorative scented candles. The bottles would be made of clear glass or a translucent material to allow light to pass through, showcasing the candle's flame. Each bottle would contain a different fragrance, allowing for a versatile range from floral to woody notes. The candles could also have an adjustable wick to control the intensity of the scent. ",
    "**Personalized Fragrance Diffusers**: Design perfume bottles that can be used as room diffusers. These bottles would be equipped with a small atomizer pump, allowing users to release a customized scent into the air. Users can fill these bottles with their own favorite essential oils or perfumes, creating a personalized ambiance in any room.",
    "**Interactive Scent Experience**: Develop perfume bottles that come with a QR code or NFC tag. When scanned, the code would direct the user to a digital platform offering a 360-degree virtual reality experience related to the scent. For example, a lavender-scented bottle could take the user on a calming journey through a virtual garden.",
    "**DIY Perfume Kits**: Create DIY perfume kits that include a set of concentrated fragrance oils, a variety of base ingredients (like alcohol or glycerin), and blank perfume bottles. These kits allow users to mix and match scents to create their own unique fragrances. This not only provides a creative outlet but also encourages sustainability by reducing waste from pre-made, single-use products.",
    "**Smart Perfume Technology**: In collaboration with tech companies, develop perfume bottles that integrate smart technology. The bottles could be synced with a smartphone app, allowing users to customize and adjust their scent throughout the day based on time of day, weather, or even mood. The app might offer scent suggestions based on user preferences or provide educational content about the fragrance compounds. "
