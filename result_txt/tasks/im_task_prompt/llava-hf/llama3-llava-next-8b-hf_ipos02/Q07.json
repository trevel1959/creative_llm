    "Smart Toothbrush: Create a smart toothbrush that tracks and analyzes the user's brushing habits, providing personalized recommendations for improvement. The toothbrush could also have a companion app that sends reminders and tracks progress over time.",
    "Ergonomic Design: Design a toothbrush with an ergonomic handle that is comfortable to hold and reduces strain on the hand and wrist. The bristles could be made from materials that are gentler on the gums and teeth.",
    "LED Light: Add an LED light to the toothbrush that illuminates the teeth and gums, allowing the user to see any plaque or debris more clearly. This can help the user brush more effectively and monitor their oral health.",
    "Multiple Brush Head Options: Develop a toothbrush that comes with interchangeable brush heads for different cleaning needs, such as whitening, sensitive teeth, or gum care. This would cater to users with different oral health requirements.",
    "Toothpaste Dispenser: Incorporate a small toothpaste dispenser within the handle of the toothbrush, eliminating the need for a separate toothpaste tube. This would be particularly useful for travel or situations where carrying a full-sized toothpaste tube is inconvenient."
