    "Utilize vertical gardening techniques: With the ground becoming too hard to dig into, you could shift your focus to vertical gardening methods. This includes using trellises, arbors, and walls to grow plants. By training vines, shrubs, and climbing plants to grow upwards, you can create a thriving garden without having to dig into the ground. This method also saves space and can be used in small urban areas where space is limited.",
    "Use hydroponics or aeroponics: Another option is to use hydroponics or aeroponics to grow your plants. These methods involve growing plants in a nutrient-rich solution rather than soil. This allows you to grow plants in areas where the soil is not suitable for digging, such as on rooftops or in indoor spaces. Hydroponics uses a nutrient-rich solution to feed the plants, while aeroponics uses a fine mist of water and nutrients to feed the plants. Both methods are highly efficient and can be used to grow a wide variety of plants.",
    "Create a green roof: A green roof is a layer of plants that is grown on top of a building. This can be a great option for areas where the ground is too hard to dig into, as it allows you to create a garden without having to dig into the soil. Green roofs can also help to insulate buildings, reduce stormwater runoff, and provide habitats for wildlife. You can choose from a variety of plants that are well-suited to growing on a roof, such as sedums, succulents, and herbs.",
    "Use a raised bed: If the ground is too hard to dig into, you can create a raised bed using wooden or plastic containers. Raised beds are ideal for growing vegetables, herbs, and flowers, as they provide better drainage and soil structure than traditional gardens. You can fill the raised beds with a mix of soil and compost, and add any necessary nutrients to create a thriving garden. Raised beds are also a great option for small spaces, as they can be placed on balconies, patios, or in other areas where space is limited.",
