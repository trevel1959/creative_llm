    "**Innovative Hairbrush with LED Lighting**: Design a hairbrush with built-in LED lights that can help users style their hair in low-light conditions or at night. The brush's bristles can have integrated LED lights that illuminate the scalp, allowing for precise styling even when there's insufficient natural or ambient light. This could be particularly useful for makeup application or for people with limited visibility.",
    "**Detangling Hairbrush with Built-in Fan**: Create a hairbrush with a mini fan attached to its base. The fan would provide a gentle breeze while brushing, which helps to reduce tangles and knots. This would make the process of detangling more comfortable and efficient, especially for individuals with thick or long hair.",
    "**Smart Hairbrush with AI Technology**: Develop a hairbrush that uses AI technology to analyze hair health. It could monitor factors like hair breakage, split ends, and even the rate of hair growth. The brush could provide personalized advice on hair care routines, suggest treatments based on the analysis, and even alert the user to potential issues like hair loss.",
    "**Hairbrush with Scalp Massager**: Integrate small, vibrating massagers into the bristles of the hairbrush. These massagers would stimulate blood flow to the scalp, promoting hair growth and reducing stress on the scalp. This could be especially beneficial for people experiencing hair loss or those who want to improve the overall health of their hair.",
    "**Customizable Hairbrush with Rechargeable Handle**: Design a hairbrush where the handle is rechargeable and can be customized with different types of bristles (such as nylon, boar bristles, etc.). Users can swap out the handle to suit their specific hair type and styling needs. This allows for flexibility in hair grooming routines without needing to purchase multiple brushes. "
