    "**Solar Window Film**: Install a special film on windows that harnesses solar energy to heat or cool the room. This film would change its opacity or transparency based on the temperature inside, allowing natural light to enter during cooler hours and blocking it during warmer hours. This would not only regulate temperature but also reduce energy consumption.",
    "**Phase Change Materials**: Incorporate phase change materials (PCMs) into building insulation. These materials absorb and release heat as they change phase from solid to liquid or vice versa, maintaining a stable indoor temperature. This would eliminate the need for traditional heating and cooling systems.",
    "**Evaporative Cooling with Fog**: Implement a fog-based evaporative cooling system. By introducing a fine mist of water into the air, the evaporation process would cool the surrounding environment. This method would be especially effective in dry climates, reducing the need for traditional air conditioning.",
    "**Thermal Energy Storage in Water**: Utilize a network of underground pipes filled with water, which would be heated or cooled during off-peak hours. During peak hours, the water would be pumped through the building's radiators or air handlers, providing a stable and consistent temperature. This system would reduce energy consumption and minimize the impact on the environment.",
    "**Biophilic Design**: Design buildings with a focus on biophilic principles, incorporating natural elements and ventilation strategies. This would include features like living walls, green roofs, and strategically placed windows to maximize natural light and airflow. By leveraging nature's cooling and heating capabilities, buildings could maintain a comfortable temperature without relying on traditional HVAC systems.
