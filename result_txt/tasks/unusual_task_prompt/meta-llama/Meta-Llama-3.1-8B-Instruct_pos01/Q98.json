    "**Smart Power Strip with Energy Monitoring and Scheduling**: A power strip that not only distributes power to multiple devices but also monitors energy consumption and provides real-time feedback on energy usage. It can be controlled remotely through a mobile app, allowing users to schedule power on/off times, set energy budgets, and receive notifications when devices are left on for extended periods. This can help users reduce energy waste, save money, and make informed decisions about their energy consumption.",
    "**Power Strip with Built-in Surge Protection and USB Charging**: A power strip that not only provides surge protection for sensitive electronics but also includes multiple USB ports for convenient charging of mobile devices. The strip can detect when a device is being charged and automatically adjust the power output to prevent overcharging, reducing wear and tear on batteries. This can be especially useful for travelers or those with limited power outlets.",
    "**Smart Power Strip with Energy Harvesting and Storage**: A power strip that incorporates energy-harvesting technology, such as piezoelectric materials or solar panels, to generate power from environmental sources like vibrations or light. This power can be stored in a built-in battery or supercapacitor, allowing devices to be charged even when the power strip is not connected to a wall outlet. This can be particularly useful for remote or off-grid locations.",
    "**Modular Power Strip with Interchangeable Outlets**: A power strip that features interchangeable outlets, allowing users to customize the strip to fit their specific needs. For example, users can swap out outlets for different types of devices, such as USB-C, HDMI, or Ethernet. This can be especially useful for professionals who need to charge and power a variety of devices on the go.",
    "**Power Strip with Integrated Cable Management and Organization**: A power strip that includes built-in cable management features, such as cable ties, clips, or a retractable cable system. This can help keep cords organized and untangled, reducing clutter and making it easier to find the right outlet. This can be especially useful for those with limited desk space or who work with multiple devices."
