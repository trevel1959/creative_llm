    "**Scented Perfume Bottle Capsules**: Create a new product that consists of a perfume bottle with replaceable scent capsules. The user can choose from various fragrances and swap them out as they please. This allows for versatility and personalization, as each person can have their own signature scent or switch it up daily based on their mood or occasion.",
    "**Perfume Bottle Time Capsule**: Design a perfume bottle that has a time-release mechanism to gradually dispense the fragrance over an extended period, say a month. This ensures the scent remains potent and consistent until the end of the month, creating a unique, lasting experience.",
    "**Interactive Perfume Bottle with AR/VR**: Develop a perfume bottle that, when scanned with a smartphone using augmented reality (AR) or virtual reality (VR), presents users with a 3D interactive experience related to the scent. For example, a floral fragrance could transport the user into a virtual garden where they can explore different aspects of the floral world.",
    "**Perfume Bottle with Personalized Engraving and Custom Fragrance**: Offer a service where customers can order a custom perfume bottle with their name or a special message engraved on it. The bottle itself could contain a blend created specifically for them by blending different scents according to their preferences.",
    "**Sustainable Perfume Bottle Made from Recycled Materials**: Create a line of perfume bottles made from recycled glass or plastic. Not only would this be environmentally friendly, but you could also add a feature such as a small plant seed inside the bottle that users can plant after they've finished the perfume. This not only promotes sustainability but also encourages users to contribute positively to the environment. "
