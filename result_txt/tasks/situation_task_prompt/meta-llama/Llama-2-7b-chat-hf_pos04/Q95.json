    "Upholstered Headrest: Create a soft and cushy upholstered headrest that can be attached to a wall or a bed frame. This would provide a comfortable resting place for your head without the need for a pillow.",
    "Pillow Alternative: Develop a device that mimics the support and comfort of a pillow but uses air or water pressure instead of a soft filling. This could be achieved through the use of inflatable or water-filled chambers that can be adjusted to different firmness levels.",
    "Smart Pillow: Create a pillow that incorporates advanced technology to enhance sleep quality. This could include sensors that track sleep patterns, monitor heart rate and breathing, and provide feedback on how to improve sleep quality.",
    "Shape-Shifting Pillow: Develop a pillow that can change shape to accommodate different sleeping positions. This could be achieved through the use of a flexible, shape-memory material that can be molded to different shapes and then return to its original form.",
