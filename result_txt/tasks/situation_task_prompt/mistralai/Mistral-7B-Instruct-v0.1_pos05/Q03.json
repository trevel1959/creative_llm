    "In a treehouse: If my house were to disappear, I would build myself a treehouse in the nearest forest. I love spending time in nature and a treehouse would be the perfect place to live in a sustainable and eco-friendly way.",
    "In a van: I would hit the road and travel in a van. I've always wanted to explore the world and this would be the perfect opportunity to do so. I would live off the grid and find places to park my van wherever I want.",
    "In a yurt: I would build myself a yurt in a remote location. I've always been fascinated by nomadic cultures and a yurt would be the perfect place to live off the grid and be self-sufficient.",
    "In a cottage: I would find a cottage in a rural area and move in. I've always loved the idea of living in a quaint cottage with a fireplace and a garden. I would use my skills to fix up the cottage and make it my own.",
    "In a tiny house: I would build myself a tiny house and park it in a location with beautiful views. I've always been drawn to the minimalist lifestyle and a tiny house would be the perfect place to live. I would use my creativity to design a tiny house that is both functional and beautiful."
