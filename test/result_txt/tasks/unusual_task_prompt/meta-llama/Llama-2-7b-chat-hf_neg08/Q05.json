    "Turn your envy into inspiration: Instead of letting jealousy consume you, use it as motivation to improve your own productivity. Set achievable goals for yourself and work towards them with renewed determination. You could even challenge yourself to complete a task faster or better than the person you're feeling envious of.",
    "Find the root of the issue: Reflect on why you're feeling jealous in the first place. Is it because you're not as organized as the person you're envying? Is it because you're struggling with a particular task? Once you identify the root cause, you can start working on a solution. For example, you could try using a planner or app to help you stay organized, or seek help from a tutor or mentor to improve your skills.",
    "Practice self-compassion: Remember that everyone has their own strengths and weaknesses, and it's okay to struggle with certain tasks. Don't beat yourself up over feeling jealous â€“ instead, offer yourself kindness and support. Remind yourself that you're doing your best, and that it's okay to ask for help when you need it.",
    "Focus on your own goals: Rather than comparing yourself to others, focus on your own goals and aspirations. What do you want to achieve? What are your strengths and passions? By focusing on your own goals, you can tap into your inner motivation and drive, and stop comparing yourself to others.",
    "Create a productivity ritual: Develop a daily or weekly ritual that helps you stay focused and productive. This could be as simple as taking a few minutes each day to plan your tasks, or as elaborate as creating a specific workspace or routine. By having a consistent routine, you can train your mind to stay on track and avoid distractions, helping you to be more productive and efficient."
