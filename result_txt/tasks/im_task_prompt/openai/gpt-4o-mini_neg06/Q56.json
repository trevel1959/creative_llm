    "**Multi-Tone Bicycle Bell**: Instead of a single sound, this bell would feature multiple tones that the rider can customize. For example, the rider could select different sounds for different situations: a gentle chime for pedestrians, a louder alarm for cars, and a melodic tune for fellow cyclists. This would help convey different messages to various road users and make cycling more interactive.",
    "**Light-Up Bicycle Bell**: Incorporating LED lights into the design of the bell, this product would not only make a sound but also flash in various colors when activated. The lights could serve as a visual alert for drivers and pedestrians, especially in low-light conditions, enhancing safety. Riders could even choose from different light patterns to convey specific messages, like a steady flash for caution or a rapid flash for urgency.",
    "**Eco-Friendly Bicycle Bell**: Made from sustainable materials, this bicycle bell would appeal to environmentally conscious cyclists. The design could include recycled metals and bioplastics, and it could feature a unique aesthetic that reflects nature, such as leaf patterns or earth tones. Additionally, a portion of the sales could go towards environmental initiatives, making it a product that supports a good cause.",
    "**Voice-Activated Bicycle Bell**: This innovative bell would respond to voice commands, allowing the rider to activate it without needing to press a button. For example, the cyclist could say \"ring\" to activate the bell, making it especially useful when their hands are full or if they need to signal quickly. This feature could also be integrated with a voice assistant for additional functionalities, like navigation prompts.",
    "**Adjustable Volume Bicycle Bell**: This bell would feature a volume control that allows the rider to adjust the sound based on their environment. In quieter areas, a softer ring could be used, while in busier settings, the volume could be increased for better audibility. This would cater to various riding conditions and help maintain a balance between safety and courtesy towards others."
