    "**Expandable Hose with Built-in UV Protection**: Create a hose that expands when water is turned on and contracts when turned off, but also incorporates UV-resistant materials to prevent damage from sunlight. This would make the hose lighter and easier to store while ensuring it lasts longer, reducing the need for replacements due to sun exposure.",
    "**Self-Repairing Hose**: Design a hose made from a special material that can self-repair minor leaks or punctures when exposed to water. This could be achieved through a combination of polymers that bond together when they come into contact with moisture, ensuring that small issues donâ€™t escalate into larger leaks and prolonging the hose's lifespan.",
    "**Modular Hose System**: Introduce a modular garden hose system where users can connect different sections based on their needs. Each section could serve a different purpose, such as a section with a spray nozzle, a section with a drip irrigation system, or even a section that can filter water. This customizable approach would allow gardeners to adapt their hoses for various tasks without needing multiple hoses.",
    "**Eco-Friendly Hose with Biodegradable Materials**: Develop a garden hose made from biodegradable materials that break down over time without harming the environment. This hose could be marketed towards eco-conscious consumers and would reduce plastic waste. Additionally, the hose could be infused with natural plant-based compounds that promote soil health when it eventually decomposes.",
    "**Hose with Built-in Fertilizer Dispensing System**: Create a hose that has an integrated fertilizer dispenser. Users could fill a compartment with liquid fertilizer, and as they water their plants, the hose would automatically mix the right amount of fertilizer with the water. This would streamline the gardening process, ensuring plants receive nutrients consistently without extra effort."
