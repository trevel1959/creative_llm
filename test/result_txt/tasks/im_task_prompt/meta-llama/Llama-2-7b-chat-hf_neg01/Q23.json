    "Desk of the Future: Imagine a desk that can transform into a smart workstation, equipped with AI-powered tools and interfaces that can help you stay organized and focused. This desk could have a built-in AI assistant that can learn your work habits and preferences, and adapt to your needs over time. It could also have a built-in display that can project holographic images, allowing you to collaborate with remote colleagues in a more immersive and interactive way.",
    "Desk of the Past: Take a nod from the classic workspaces of yesteryear and create a desk that looks like it belongs in a vintage office. This desk could have a wooden top with intricate carvings, metal legs, and a built-in lamp that resembles an old-fashioned gas lamp. The desk could also have a hidden compartment or two, perfect for storing secret documents or treasured mementos.",
    "Desk of the Outdoors: Create a desk that brings the great outdoors inside. This desk could have a rustic wooden top with a natural stone or bark finish, and metal legs that resemble tree branches. The desk could also have built-in planters that allow you to grow small plants or herbs, adding a touch of nature to your workspace.",
    "Desk of the Absurd: Take a break from practicality and create a desk that's a little bit absurd. This desk could have a top made of a giant, inflatable beach ball, or a base that resembles a giant robot foot. The desk could also have a built-in coffee maker that dispenses coffee beans instead of coffee, or a built-in fan that blows around paper clips instead of air.",
    "Desk of the Future: Create a desk that's powered by the sun. This desk could have a solar panel built into the top, which can charge your devices and power your workspace. The desk could also have a built-in compost bin that turns your food scraps into fertilizer for your plants, or a built-in water filtration system that turns your tap water into crystal-clear drinking water."
