    "**Resource Allocation and Budget Constraints**: Large-scale experiments often require significant funding for equipment, personnel, and materials. Budget overruns can occur due to unforeseen expenses, leading to a compromise in the quality or scope of the research. To address this, a detailed budget plan with contingencies should be established, alongside seeking grants or partnerships with academic institutions or industries to share costs.",
    "**Data Management and Integrity Issues**: With large volumes of data generated, maintaining data integrity, accuracy, and security can be challenging. There is a risk of data loss, mismanagement, or breaches of confidentiality. Implementing a robust data management system, including regular backups, encryption, and access controls, is essential. Training staff on data handling protocols can further enhance data integrity.",
    "**Equipment and Technology Failures**: Technical malfunctions can disrupt the experiment, leading to delays or compromised results. This could stem from outdated equipment, software bugs, or power outages. To counter this, conducting thorough pre-experiment checks, having backup equipment available, and ensuring a reliable power supply through generators or UPS systems can help minimize downtime.",
    "**Interdisciplinary Collaboration Conflicts**: Large-scale experiments often require collaboration across various fields of expertise, which can lead to communication breakdowns, differing priorities, or conflicting methodologies. Establishing clear roles, regular meetings, and open lines of communication can foster collaboration and ensure that all team members are aligned with the experiment's goals.",
    "**Compliance with Regulatory Standards**: Navigating the regulatory landscape can be complex, especially with experiments involving human subjects or environmental impacts. Non-compliance can result in legal issues or funding loss. Researchers should familiarize themselves with relevant regulations, seek guidance from compliance officers, and submit necessary documentation well in advance of the experiment."
