    "Solar-powered lighting system: I would install solar panels on my roof or walls to generate electricity and power LED lights or lamps throughout my home. This would ensure that I have enough light during the day even if the sun doesn't rise.",
    "Light-emitting plants: I would research and purchase plants that emit light, such as succulents or certain species of mushrooms. These plants would provide a natural source of light and would also help to purify the air in my home.",
    "Mirror reflecting sunlight: I would place mirrors strategically around my home to reflect sunlight from windows or skylights. This would help to brighten up the rooms and create a sense of depth and space.",
    "LED lights and candles: I would stock up on LED lights and candles to provide ample lighting during the day. LED lights are energy-efficient and long-lasting, while candles provide a warm and cozy atmosphere.",
    "Outdoor activities: If the sun didn't rise, I would take advantage of the daylight by spending time outdoors. I would go for a hike, have a picnic, or participate in outdoor sports to make the most of the daylight hours."
