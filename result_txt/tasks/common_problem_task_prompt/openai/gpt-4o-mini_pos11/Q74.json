    "**Orbital Debris Collision**: As the number of satellites in orbit increases, so does the risk of collisions with existing orbital debris. This poses a significant threat to both the new satellite and others already in space. To combat this problem, mission planners can conduct detailed assessments of the satellite's trajectory and potential collision risks. Implementing active debris removal technologies or designing satellites with the capability to maneuver can also reduce the likelihood of collisions.",
    "**Regulatory and Compliance Issues**: Launching a satellite involves navigating a complex landscape of regulations and compliance requirements, both nationally and internationally. Issues can arise if the launch fails to adhere to licensing regulations or environmental standards. To address this, organizations should engage legal experts early in the planning process to ensure all necessary permits are secured and that the launch complies with international treaties governing space activities.",
    "**Funding and Budget Overruns**: The cost of developing, launching, and operating a satellite can be substantial, and budget overruns are a common issue. This can stem from unexpected technical challenges, delays, or changes in project scope. To prevent this, a robust financial plan should be established with contingency funding. Regular budget reviews and cost management strategies will also help keep the project on track.",
    "**Supply Chain Disruptions**: The satellite launch industry relies on a complex supply chain for components and materials. Disruptions—due to natural disasters, geopolitical tensions, or pandemics—can delay the project timeline. To mitigate this risk, establishing multiple suppliers for critical components and maintaining a buffer stock of essential materials can help ensure continuity in the supply chain.",
    "**Public and Environmental Concerns**: The launch of a satellite can raise public concerns about environmental impacts, such as noise pollution, emissions, and the potential for accidents. Addressing these concerns requires transparent communication with the public and stakeholders. Engaging in environmental impact assessments and promoting the satellite's benefits, such as improved communication or climate monitoring, can help alleviate fears and garner support."
