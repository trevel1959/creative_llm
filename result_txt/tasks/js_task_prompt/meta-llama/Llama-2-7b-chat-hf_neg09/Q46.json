    "Become a Shapeshifter: With the power of shapeshifting, I could transform into any living being I desire. I could turn into a bird and soar through the skies, or a bear and roam the forests.

For instance, I could transform into a firefighter and put out fires, or into a doctor and heal the sick.",
    "Become a Ghost: If I had the power to change my appearance at will, I would love to become a ghost. As a ghost, I could move through walls and objects, invisible to the naked eye.
