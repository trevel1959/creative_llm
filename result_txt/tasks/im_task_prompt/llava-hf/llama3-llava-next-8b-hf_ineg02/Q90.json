    "Multi-Instrument Guitar: Develop a modular guitar system that allows players to switch between different types of guitars (e.g., electric, acoustic, bass) and even different instruments (e.g., violin, cello, drums) with the same guitar body. This would provide a versatile playing experience and cater to a wide range of musical styles.",
    "Ergonomic Guitar: Redesign the guitar to optimize comfort and reduce strain during long playing sessions. This could include adjustable fingerboard height, a contoured body shape, and a built-in ergonomic support system.",
    "Guitar Amplifier: Create a compact, high-quality guitar amplifier that can be worn like a backpack. This would allow players to practice or perform on the go without the need for a bulky amplifier or cable setup.",
    "Guitar Effects Pedal: Develop a compact effects pedal that can be mounted on the guitar itself, providing instant access to a variety of effects without the need for a separate pedalboard.",
    "Guitar Learning App: Create a mobile app that utilizes augmented reality technology to teach guitar playing. The app could overlay virtual guitar strings and frets on the real guitar, providing interactive tutorials and exercises."
