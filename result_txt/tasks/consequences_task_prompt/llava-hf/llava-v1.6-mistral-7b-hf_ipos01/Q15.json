    "Transportation Revolution: Without oil, cars, airplanes, and other fossil fuel-dependent modes of transportation would become obsolete. People would have to adapt to new forms of transportation, such as electric cars, trains, and bicycles. This could lead to improved air quality and reduced traffic congestion in cities.",
    "Agricultural Changes: Oil is used in the production of many agricultural chemicals and fertilizers. In its absence, farmers would have to adopt organic and sustainable farming practices, which could lead to healthier soil and a more diverse range of crops.",
    "Energy-Efficient Infrastructure: The need for energy-efficient infrastructure would become even more critical. Buildings would be designed to maximize energy efficiency, and cities would focus on walkability and public transportation to reduce the need for fuel.",
    "Economic Shift: The oil industry would collapse, leading to a significant loss of jobs and economic instability. However, new industries could emerge to fill the void, such as green technology, sustainable agriculture, and eco-tourism.",
    "Global Collaboration: The absence of oil would force countries to collaborate on a global scale to find solutions and share resources. This could lead to a more equitable distribution of resources and a stronger global community."
