    "Use natural ingredients: If all cosmetic products disappeared, we would have to rely on natural ingredients to maintain our personal grooming habits. This could mean using ingredients like honey, aloe vera, and essential oils for skin care, and using natural brushes and combs for hair care. We could also use natural products like clay and charcoal for teeth cleaning and whitening.",
    "DIY grooming: We could learn how to make our own cosmetic products at home. This could include making our own face masks, moisturizers, and hair treatments. We could also learn how to make our own natural deodorants and perfumes.",
    "Adopt a minimalist approach: Without cosmetic products, we would have to adopt a minimalist approach to grooming. This could mean using fewer products and focusing on the essentials like a goodhead wash, toothbrush, and razor.",
    "Embrace our naturalhead: Without cosmetic products, we would have to embrace our naturalhead. This could mean letting our hair grow out and embracing its natural texture and color. We could also learn how to style our hair using natural products like coconut oil and shea butter.",
    "Focus on overall health: Without cosmetic products, we would have to focus on overall health. This could mean eating a healthy diet, getting enough sleep, and exercising regularly. By taking care of our overall health, we would maintain our personal grooming habits in a natural and healthy way."
