    "One potential consequence of regenerating limbs like starfish could be a significant increase in the ability of humans to adapt to injuries or disabilities. Starfish have the ability to regenerate their limbs and move around with ease, which could inspire the development of prosthetics that are more flexible and adaptable.",
    "Another consequence could be a shift in our understanding of regenerative medicine. If we are able to regenerate limbs like starfish, it could lead to the development of new treatments for a variety of injuries and diseases.",
    "There could also be ethical implications to consider. If we are able to regenerate limbs like starfish, it could lead to questions about the value of human life and the role of technology in shaping our bodies.",
    "A potential consequence could be a change in the way we view the environment. Starfish have the ability to regenerate their limbs in response to damage caused by pollution or other environmental factors. If we are able to regenerate limbs like starfish, it could lead to a greater awareness of the importance of protecting our environment.",
    "There could also be implications for the future of space exploration. If we are able to regenerate limbs like starfish, it could lead to the development of new technologies that would allow us to survive and thrive in environments that are currently inhospitable to humans."
