The challenge could also include a leaderboard or a prize for the participant who shows the most significant improvement in their sleep quality.",
    "Sleep-themed art exhibit: Host an art exhibit featuring works inspired by sleep and dreams.

The exhibit could also include interactive elements, such as a \"dream journal\" where visitors can record their own dreams and share them with others.",
    "Sleep-focused podcast: Launch a podcast that explores the science and culture of sleep. Each episode could feature an interview with an expert in the field, such as a sleep researcher, psychologist, or neuroscientist.

The experience could be offered in a dedicated space or even as a mobile service that travels to different locations."
