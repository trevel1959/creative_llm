    "Plastic-eating microbes: Introducing microorganisms that can break down plastic as efficiently as they do paper. These microbes could be genetically engineered to consume various plastic polymers, reducing the amount of plastic waste in landfills and oceans.",
    "Biodegradable plastic alternatives: Developing plastics that decompose at the same rate as paper, made from renewable resources like corn starch, sugarcane, or potato starch. These biodegradable plastics could replace traditional plastics in packaging, disposable products, and other applications.",
    "Plastic-eating fungi: Harnessing the power of fungi to break down plastic waste. Fungi can naturally degrade organic materials, and with genetic engineering, they could be optimized to consume plastics more efficiently. This approach could also help to clean up existing plastic waste.",
    "Circular plastic economy: Implementing a circular economy model for plastic, where plastic waste is collected, recycled, and reused. This would reduce the amount of plastic waste that ends up in landfills and oceans, and create new business opportunities for plastic recycling and reuse.",
    "Plastic-absorbing plants: Developing plants that can absorb and break down plastic pollutants in the environment. For example, certain types of algae and bacteria can absorb and degrade plastic, reducing the amount of plastic waste in waterways and oceans. These plants could be used to clean up existing plastic waste and prevent further pollution."
