    "Infrastructure Strain: The single city would require a massive amount of infrastructure to support its population. This would put a significant strain on resources like water, energy, and food, as well as on the environment.",
    "Housing Crisis: The demand for housing would be enormous, and there would be a shortage of available homes. This could lead to skyrocketing housing prices and a significant increase in homelessness.",
    "Cultural Diversity Loss: A single city would likely lead to a homogenization of culture as different cultures would merge into one. This could result in the loss of unique traditions, languages, and customs.",
    "Economic Disparity: With everyone living in one place, there would be a concentration of wealth and resources. This could lead to a widening gap between the rich and the poor, as well as increased competition for jobs and opportunities.",
    "Environmental Impact: The concentration of people in one area would have a significant impact on the environment. The single city would produce more pollution, waste, and greenhouse gas emissions, contributing to global warming and climate change."
