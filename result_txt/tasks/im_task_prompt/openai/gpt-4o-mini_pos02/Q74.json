    "**Multi-Functional Watering Can**:    Design a watering can that can also function as a fertilizer dispenser. The can could have a compartment for liquid fertilizer that mixes with water as it pours. A simple dial could allow users to adjust the ratio of water to fertilizer, making it easy to nourish plants while watering. This dual functionality would save time and effort, making gardening more efficient.",
    "**Ergonomic Design with Adjustable Spout**:    Create a watering can with an ergonomic handle that reduces strain on the wrist and forearm. Additionally, the spout could be adjustable in length and angle, allowing users to easily water plants in hard-to-reach areas or delicate seedlings without the risk of over-splashing. This design would enhance comfort and accessibility for gardeners of all ages.",
    "**Solar-Powered Watering Can**:    Equip the watering can with a small solar panel that powers a built-in pump. This pump could draw water from a nearby source (like a rain barrel or pond) and allow for pressurized watering, making it easier to reach higher plants or provide a gentle mist for delicate flowers. This eco-friendly feature would promote sustainable gardening practices and reduce water waste.",
    "**Color-Changing Watering Can**:    Develop a watering can with a color-changing feature that indicates the temperature of the water inside. The can could be made from thermochromic materials that change color when the water is too hot or too cold for plants. This visual cue would help gardeners ensure they are using water at the ideal temperature, promoting healthier plant growth.",
    "**Modular Watering Can**:    Design a modular watering can that can be customized with interchangeable components. Users could add or remove different spouts (e.g., a fine mist for seedlings, a wide spout for larger plants) or attach additional water reservoirs for longer watering sessions. This versatility would cater to various gardening needs and allow for easy storage and transport."
