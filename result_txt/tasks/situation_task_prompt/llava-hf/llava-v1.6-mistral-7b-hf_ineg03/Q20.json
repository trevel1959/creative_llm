    "**High-Speed Rail Network**: A global high-speed rail network could be developed to connect major cities across continents. Trains are an efficient and environmentally friendly mode of transportation, and with the advent of hyperloop technology, they could cover vast distances in a matter of hours.",
    "**Space Travel**: If air travel were to become obsolete, space travel could become a viable alternative. Companies like SpaceX and Blue Origin are already developing reusable rockets that could transport passengers to the International Space Station and beyond. As technology advances, these rockets could be adapted to transport passengers to other continents.",
    "**Underwater Tunnels**: A network of underwater tunnels could be constructed to connect major cities across continents. These tunnels would allow passengers to travel vast distances without ever leaving the water, offering a unique and potentially faster mode of transportation.",
    "**Teleportation**: While still in the realm of science fiction, teleportation could become a reality in the future. If it were possible to teleport people from one place to another, it would eliminate the need for planes and other forms of transportation.",
    "**Hovercrafts**: Hovercrafts, also known as air cushion vehicles, could be adapted to travel long distances over water. These vehicles can travel on land, water, and even ice, making them versatile and potentially fast modes of transportation."
