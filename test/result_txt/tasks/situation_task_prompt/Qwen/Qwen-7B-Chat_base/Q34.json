    "Rainwater harvesting: Collecting rainwater in a storage tank or underground cistern can be an excellent way to water plants without relying on rainfall. The collected water can be used for irrigation, washing, and other household purposes.",
    "Drip irrigation: Drip irrigation is a method of watering plants by delivering water directly to the roots through small emitters attached to the plant's stem. This method reduces water waste and promotes healthy plant growth.",
    "Artificial rainfall: Using an artificial rainfall system can simulate the natural process of rainfall and provide plants with the necessary moisture. These systems are often used in greenhouses and other controlled environments where access to natural rainfall is limited.",
    "Hydroponics: Hydroponics is a method of growing plants in nutrient-rich water instead of soil. By controlling the amount of water and nutrients delivered to the plants, hydroponic systems can be used to grow plants even in areas where rainfall is scarce.",
    "Planters with built-in water reservoirs: Planters with built-in water reservoirs can be used to water plants when rainfall is not available. The reservoir can be filled with water from a tap or other source, and the water can be released into the planter as needed using a drip irrigation system. This method is particularly useful for outdoor plants that cannot be moved indoors during dry periods."
