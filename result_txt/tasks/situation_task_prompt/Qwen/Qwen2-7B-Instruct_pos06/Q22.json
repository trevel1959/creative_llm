    "**Underground Tunnel System**: Create an extensive network of underground tunnels that connect various parts of the town or city. These tunnels could be designed for both pedestrian and vehicular traffic. The system would include lighting, ventilation, and emergency exits. The idea of an underground tunnel system would offer a unique solution to mobility without roads. **Confidence Score: 0.9**",
    "**Aerial Cable Car Network**: Implement a series of cable cars suspended over rooftops and buildings to provide a vertical and horizontal transport system. These cable cars would run on a network of tracks, allowing for efficient movement across the town or city. This method would require careful planning to ensure safety and minimize disruption to existing structures. **Confidence Score: 0.85**",
    "**Automated Underwater Walkways**: In coastal towns or cities near water bodies, develop a series of underwater walkways connecting different areas. These walkways could be equipped with lighting and safety features, providing an alternative means of transportation that avoids the need for roads. **Confidence Score: 0.9**",
    "**Hoverboard or Personal Flyer Routes**: Design dedicated lanes for hoverboards or personal flying devices, creating a network that allows residents to travel swiftly and efficiently. This solution would require airspace management and possibly noise reduction measures. **Confidence Score: 0.8**",
    "**Elevated Walkways and Railways**: Construct elevated pathways and railways above the ground level, using existing trees or natural barriers as support. This approach would not only avoid the need for roads but also incorporate green spaces and enhance the urban landscape. **Confidence Score: 0.9**"
