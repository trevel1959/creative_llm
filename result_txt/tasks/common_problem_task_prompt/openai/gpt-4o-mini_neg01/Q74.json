    "**Weather Conditions**: Launching a satellite is highly dependent on favorable weather conditions. High winds, thunderstorms, or thick clouds can delay a launch or necessitate a complete rescheduling. If the launch window is missed, it could impact the satellite's operational timeline, particularly if it is intended for a specific mission that has time-sensitive elements, such as disaster response or scientific observation.",
    "**Regulatory and Compliance Issues**: The launch of a satellite involves navigating a complex web of regulations from various governmental and international bodies. This includes obtaining launch licenses, ensuring compliance with space debris mitigation guidelines, and adhering to frequency allocation for communication. Failure to meet these requirements could lead to legal issues, fines, or even a launch cancellation.",
    "**Cost Overruns**: The budget for launching a satellite can be unpredictable, with costs potentially spiraling due to delays, design changes, or unanticipated technical challenges. If the project exceeds its budget, it could jeopardize funding for future missions or require the team to make compromises on satellite capabilities, impacting its effectiveness.",
    "**Public and Stakeholder Expectations**: Launching a satellite often involves multiple stakeholders, including government agencies, private companies, and the public. Each group may have different expectations regarding the satellite's capabilities, timelines, and results. If the launch does not meet these expectations—due to delays, failures, or less-than-anticipated performance—it can lead to dissatisfaction, loss of trust, and reputational damage.",
    "**International Relations and Space Debris**: The launch of satellites can raise concerns among other nations, especially if the satellite has military applications or if its orbit intersects with that of other satellites. There may be fears of espionage or militarization of space, leading to strained international relations. Additionally, the potential for creating space debris during the launch or from the satellite's operational life poses risks to other spacecraft, necessitating careful planning and coordination."
