    "Once upon a time, in a quaint village, lived a young girl named Lila who discovered a magic paintbrush hidden in her attic. Whatever she painted came to life! One day, she painted a beautiful garden filled with flowers that bloomed with vibrant colors. The villagers were amazed, and soon, Lila painted food for the hungry and toys for the children. However, a greedy merchant sought to steal the brush. Lila, clever and brave, painted a massive wall that encircled her village, protecting it. The merchant, trapped outside, learned that true wealth lies in sharing, and Lilaâ€™s kindness painted a brighter world.",
