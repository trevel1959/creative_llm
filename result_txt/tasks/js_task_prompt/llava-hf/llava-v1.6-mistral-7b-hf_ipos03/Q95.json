    "**Vertical Forest**: This habitat would be a tall, multi-tiered structure designed to house animals that naturally inhabit high-altitude environments, such as mountain goats or birds of prey. The structure would include climbing walls, platforms, and nesting sites, allowing the animals to move vertically and engage in their natural behaviors.",
    "**Submerged Ecosystem**: This habitat would be a large, submerged enclosure that simulates an underwater environment, complete with coral reefs, seaweed, and fish. It would be designed to house marine animals and provide a safe and enriching environment for them to thrive.",
    "**Trophic Cascade**: This habitat would be designed to mimic the natural trophic cascade, with different levels representing different parts of the food chain. Predators would be housed on the top levels, while prey species would be on the lower levels. This would allow for natural predator-prey relationships and provide a more realistic environment for the animals.",
    "**Thermal Vault**: This habitat would be a large, temperature-controlled enclosure designed to house animals that are native to extreme climates, such as polar bears or desert-dwelling lizards. The enclosure would be able to adjust the temperature and humidity to replicate the animals' natural habitats, ensuring their comfort and well-being.",
    "**Eco-Tourism Sanctuary**: This habitat would be designed to house animals in a way that allows visitors to observe them in a more natural setting. The enclosure would be surrounded by a moat, and the animals would be housed in enclosures that blend seamlessly with the surrounding landscape. Visitors could observe the animals from a safe distance, providing an educational and immersive experience."
