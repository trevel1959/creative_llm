    "**Modular Wheelchair Design**: Create a modular wheelchair that allows users to customize and upgrade parts according to their needs. For instance, users could swap out wheels for different terrains (e.g., rugged, smooth), adjust seating for comfort, or add accessories like storage compartments or trays. This flexibility would enable users to adapt their wheelchair for various activities, whether it’s outdoor adventures or daily commuting.",
    "**Energy-Generating Wheelchair**: Design a wheelchair equipped with a kinetic energy recovery system that captures energy from the user’s movements. As the user propels the wheelchair, the system could charge a battery that powers lights, USB ports for charging devices, or even small assistive technologies. This would promote sustainability and provide users with extra convenience.",
    "**Wearable Exoskeleton Integration**: Develop a hybrid wheelchair that can be paired with a lightweight exoskeleton. This system would allow users to transition from sitting to standing, providing independence in social settings and helping with mobility in tight spaces. The exoskeleton could assist with balance and provide support for users to walk short distances, enhancing their overall mobility experience.",
    "**Virtual Reality Training and Support**: Create a virtual reality (VR) platform for wheelchair users that simulates different environments and scenarios. This could help users practice navigating through challenging spaces, like crowded areas or uneven terrain, improving their confidence and skills. Additionally, VR could be used for rehabilitation purposes, allowing users to engage in physical therapy exercises in an immersive environment.",
    "**Customizable Aesthetic Panels**: Introduce interchangeable aesthetic panels for wheelchairs, allowing users to express their personality and style. These panels could come in various designs, colors, and textures, making the wheelchair not just a mobility aid but also a fashion statement. This could help reduce stigma and promote inclusivity by allowing users to showcase their individuality."
