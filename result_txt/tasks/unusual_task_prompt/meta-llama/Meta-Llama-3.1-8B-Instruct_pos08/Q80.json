    "**Obstacle Course Challenge**: Design an immersive obstacle course where participants must navigate through a series of challenges that simulate real-life scenarios, such as navigating through a dense forest, crossing a \"river\" (a large inflatable), or climbing a \"mountain\" (a tall inflatable structure). Each obstacle would require participants to use problem-solving skills, physical strength, and teamwork to overcome. The course would be designed to be adjustable, allowing participants to choose their level of difficulty and adapt to their progress.",
    "**Escape the Island**: Create a survival-themed escape room where participants are \"stranded\" on a deserted island. They must work together to find and use clues to build a raft, start a fire, and signal for help. The twist? The room would be designed to be fully immersive, with realistic props, special effects, and even a \"storm\" that would simulate the challenges of being stranded. Participants would have to use their problem-solving skills, creativity, and communication to escape the island before time runs out.",
    "**The Great Challenge**: Host a series of challenges that test participants' physical and mental abilities, such as rock climbing, parkour, and mental math. Each challenge would be designed to push participants out of their comfort zones and force them to adapt to new situations. The twist? Participants would be competing against themselves, with each challenge building on the previous one to create a sense of progression and growth.",
    "**The Mysterious Laboratory**: Create a mystery-themed escape room where participants are \"scientists\" trying to uncover a conspiracy. They must work together to solve puzzles, decode messages, and uncover hidden clues to escape the laboratory before it self-destructs. The twist? The room would be designed to be highly interactive, with participants able to manipulate objects, conduct experiments, and even hack into computer systems to uncover the truth.",
    "**The Future City**: Design a futuristic-themed escape room where participants are \"city planners\" trying to save a city from a catastrophic event. They must work together to solve puzzles, allocate resources, and make decisions to prevent the disaster. The twist? The room would be designed to be highly dynamic, with participants able to influence the environment, interact with AI-powered characters, and even make decisions that would affect the outcome of the game.
