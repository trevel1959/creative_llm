    "**Smart Coat Rack with Air Purification**: Design a coat rack that doubles as an air purification system. The rack features a series of mesh panels that filter the air, removing pollutants and allergens. The coat hooks are equipped with sensors that detect the type of clothing hung on them, and the system adjusts the air purification settings accordingly. For example, if a wool coat is hung, the system would increase the air purification rate to prevent the release of allergens. The rack also comes with a built-in air quality monitor, displaying the current air quality index and providing recommendations for improvement.",
