    "**Urban Planning and Development**: City planners could utilize this power to analyze existing infrastructure and urban layouts. By seeing through walls, they could evaluate the density of buildings, identify underutilized spaces, and better understand how neighborhoods interact with one another. This insight would enable more strategic planning for parks, public transportation, and community resources, leading to more sustainable and livable cities.",
    "**Emergency Response and Safety**: First responders could greatly benefit from this ability during emergencies. Firefighters could locate victims trapped in burning buildings, while police could assess potential threats in hostage situations without putting themselves in danger. This power would enhance situational awareness and improve response times, ultimately saving lives and reducing risks during crises.",
    "**Art and Interactive Installations**: Artists could create immersive installations that incorporate the concept of seeing through walls. They could design spaces where viewers can experience multiple layers of storytelling, revealing hidden narratives or messages that are normally obscured. For example, an installation could allow participants to see the historical layers of a building, showing how it has changed over time and connecting the past with the present in a visually stunning way.",
    "**Home Security and Maintenance**: Homeowners could use this power to monitor their properties more effectively. They could check for potential issues like mold growth, pests, or plumbing leaks without the need for costly inspections. Additionally, this ability could deter crime, as would-be burglars would know that their actions could be easily seen. This could lead to a new industry of “wall scanners” that provide homeowners with insights into their property’s health and security.",
    "**Historical Research and Preservation**: Historians and archaeologists could use this power to investigate historical sites and buildings without disturbing them. By seeing through walls, they could identify artifacts, structural changes, and historical features that are no longer visible. This could lead to more accurate preservation efforts and a deeper understanding of historical contexts, allowing for a more comprehensive narrative of human history."
