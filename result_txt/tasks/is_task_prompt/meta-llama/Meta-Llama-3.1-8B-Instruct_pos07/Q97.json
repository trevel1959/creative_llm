    "**Solar-Powered Sunflower Sculpture**: Create a stunning sunflower sculpture that harnesses solar energy to power a network of tiny lights embedded within its petals. As the sun shines, the sculpture will come alive, radiating a warm, golden glow. The lights can be programmed to respond to the sun's movement, creating an immersive experience that simulates the sun's journey across the sky.",
    "**Sunflower-Inspired Urban Farm**: Design a vertically integrated urban farm that mimics the structure and functionality of a sunflower.

This innovative design will maximize space, reduce water consumption, and increase crop yields while promoting a sense of community and connection to nature.",
    "**Augmented Reality Sunflower Adventure**: Develop an immersive AR experience that transports users into a vibrant, sunflower-filled world. Participants will navigate through a sunflower field, interacting with virtual blooms that respond to their movements and emotions. The AR app will use machine learning algorithms to adapt the experience to each user's preferences, creating a unique and engaging journey.",
    "**Sunflower-Themed Wellness Retreat**: Create a serene and rejuvenating wellness retreat inspired by the sunflower's uplifting energy. The retreat will feature a series of sunflower-themed spaces, each designed to promote relaxation, self-reflection, and personal growth. Guests can participate in guided meditation sessions, yoga classes, and workshops focused on mindfulness and self-care, all set amidst a tranquil sunflower-inspired environment.",
    "**Sunflower-Infused Artisanal Products**: Develop a line of artisanal products that capture the essence of the sunflower, from fragrances to textiles to home decor items. Each product will be carefully crafted to evoke the sunflower's warm, optimistic spirit. For example, a sunflower-scented candle will fill a room with a bright, sunny aroma, while a sunflower-print throw pillow will add a pop of color and joy to any living space."
