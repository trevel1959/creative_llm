    "Indoor Lighting: With no longer nights, we would rely on artificial lighting to create a nighttime-like environment for sleep. This could involve using dimmable lights or light-blocking curtains to help regulate our body's natural sleep-wake cycle.",
    "Sleep Chambers: In a world with no night-time, people could invent sleep chambers that could induce a state of deep, restorative sleep that would replace the need for night-time. These chambers could use a combination of light, sound, and temperature control to create an environment conducive to sleep.",
    "Daytime Napping: With no night-time, napping during the day would become a more common and accepted practice. People could schedule in naps during the middle of the day or during their least productive hours to maintain their energy levels and prevent fatigue.",
    "Shift Changes: In a time without night-time, work schedules could be changed to accommodate the lack of a consistent 24-hour clock. Companies could experiment with flexible work hours, rotating shifts, or even a \"4-day week\" schedule to accommodate people's different sleep and wake patterns.",
    "Melatonin Production: In a world without night-time, researchers could find new ways to produce melatonin, the hormone that regulates sleep and wakefulness. They could develop a natural, herbal supplement or even a nasal spray that could induce sleep when needed, regardless of the time of day."
