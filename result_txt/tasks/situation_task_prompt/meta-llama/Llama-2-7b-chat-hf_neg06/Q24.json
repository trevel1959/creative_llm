    "Artificial Vision Technology: With glasses and contact lenses no longer available, people with poor vision could turn to artificial vision technology, such as bionic eyes or retinal implants. These devices could provide a digital display directly onto the retina, allowing individuals to see the world in a new way. For example, a bionic eye could be equipped with a camera and image processing algorithms to enhance visibility in low light conditions or even recognize faces.",
    "Virtual Reality Glasses: Virtual reality (VR) glasses could become the new norm for people with poor vision. These glasses would provide a virtual display that could be customized to the individual's vision needs, allowing them to see the world in a more accurate and detailed manner. VR glasses could also be used for training and education, allowing individuals to learn new skills and information in a more immersive and interactive way.",
    "Reflective Surfaces: In a world without glasses or contact lenses, people could use reflective surfaces to enhance their vision. For example, they could use mirrors or reflective tape to bounce light onto their eyes, allowing them to see more clearly. This method could be especially useful for people who are visually impaired but not completely blind.",
    "Braille and Tactile Communication: Without glasses or contact lenses, people with poor vision could rely more heavily on Braille and tactile communication. This could involve using raised dots or symbols to communicate, as well as tactile maps and guides to help navigate the world. This approach would require a shift in culture and society, but it could provide a new way of interacting and communicating.",
    "Telepathic Communication: In a world without glasses or contact lenses, people with poor vision could use telepathic communication to connect with others. This could involve using brain-computer interfaces (BCIs) or other neurotechnologies to transmit thoughts and ideas directly from one person's brain to another. This approach would require significant advances in neuroscience and engineering, but it could provide a new way of communicating and connecting with others."
