    "**Self-Cleaning Mechanism**: Introduce a self-cleaning feature that uses ultrasonic waves to dislodge pulp and residue from the juicer's components. After juicing, the user could simply add water and press a button, allowing the juicer to clean itself, making it easier to maintain and ensuring hygiene without the hassle of manual cleaning.",
    "**Adjustable Pulp Control**: Create a juicer with an adjustable pulp control system that allows users to customize the amount of pulp in their juice. By turning a dial, users could select their desired pulp level, ranging from completely smooth to a thicker texture, accommodating different preferences without needing to strain the juice afterward.",
    "**Juice Preservation System**: Integrate a vacuum-sealing feature that can store juice in glass jars immediately after juicing. This system would remove air from the jars to prevent oxidation, extending the juice's shelf life and retaining its nutrients and flavor. Users could prepare multiple servings at once and store them for later consumption.",
    "**Modular Design**: Design a modular juicer that allows users to swap out different components for specific juicing needs. For example, there could be attachments for citrus fruits, leafy greens, or hard vegetables, allowing the juicer to perform optimally for each type of ingredient while minimizing waste and maximizing efficiency.",
    "**Eco-Friendly Materials**: Utilize sustainable and biodegradable materials in the construction of the juicer. By using plant-based plastics and recycled metals, the juicer would appeal to environmentally conscious consumers. Additionally, a program could be established to recycle old juicer parts, encouraging a circular economy."
