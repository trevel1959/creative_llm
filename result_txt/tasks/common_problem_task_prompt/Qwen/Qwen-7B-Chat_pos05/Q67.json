    "Create a community-supported agriculture (CSA) program where members receive fresh produce directly from the farm on a weekly or bi-weekly basis. This will not only provide customers with high-quality, locally grown food but also help support the farm financially.",
    "Offer educational workshops and tours of the farm to educate the public about sustainable farming practices and the benefits of eating organic. This can include hands-on activities such as composting and seed planting.",
    "Sell organic products online through a website or marketplace like Amazon Fresh or Etsy. This will allow customers who live outside the local area to purchase organic produce and other products from the farm.",
    "Partner with local restaurants and cafes to source ingredients for their menus. By providing them with fresh, high-quality organic produce, the farm can expand its customer base and increase revenue.",
    "Consider hosting events such as farmers markets or festivals to promote the farm and raise awareness about the importance of organic farming. These events can also serve as opportunities to sell products and connect with potential customers."
