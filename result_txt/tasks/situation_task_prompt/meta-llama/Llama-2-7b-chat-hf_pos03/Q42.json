    "Find or create a shelter: The first thing to do when stranded on a deserted island is to find or create a shelter to protect yourself from the elements. You can use natural materials like palm fronds, branches, and rocks to build a lean-to or a hut. You can also use a large piece of driftwood or a fallen tree to create a makeshift roof. Make sure the shelter is sturdy enough to withstand wind, rain, and other harsh weather conditions.",
    "Find a source of fresh water: Finding a source of fresh water is crucial for survival on a deserted island. Look for streams, rivers, or ponds, or collect rainwater in a container. Make sure to purify the water before drinking it to avoid waterborne illnesses. You can use sand, charcoal, or bleach to purify the water.",
    "Start a fire: Fire can provide warmth, light, and a way to cook food. Look for dry wood, twigs, and other flammable materials to start a fire. You can also use magnifying glasses or other reflective surfaces to focus sunlight and start a fire. Make sure to keep the fire contained and away from flammable materials like leaves and branches.",
    "Catch fish and other seafood: If you are near the coast or a body of water, you can try to catch fish and other seafood for food. Use a makeshift fishing net or try spear fishing with a stick or rock. You can also collect shellfish like clams or mussels from the beach. Make sure to cook the seafood thoroughly to avoid foodborne illnesses.",
    "Create a signal fire: To increase your chances of being rescued, create a signal fire on a hill or a high point on the island. Use dry wood and other flammable materials to create a large fire that can be seen from a distance. You can also use mirrors or other reflective surfaces to reflect sunlight towards any passing aircraft or boats."
