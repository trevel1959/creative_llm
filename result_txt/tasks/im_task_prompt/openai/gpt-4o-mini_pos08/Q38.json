    "**Mood Color-Changing Fabric**:    Develop a sweater using thermochromic or photochromic dyes that change color based on the wearerâ€™s mood or the surrounding temperature. For example, the sweater could shift from a calm blue to a vibrant red when the wearer is feeling energetic or excited. This feature could add a fun and expressive element to fashion while also serving as a conversation starter.",
    "**Built-in Fitness Tracker**:    Incorporate a discreet fitness tracker within the fabric of the sweater. This could include sensors that monitor heart rate, calories burned, and body temperature. The data could sync with a mobile app, allowing the wearer to track their fitness goals while enjoying the comfort of their sweater. This would cater to health-conscious individuals who want to maintain an active lifestyle without sacrificing style.",
    "**Eco-Friendly Materials with a Twist**:    Create a line of sweaters made from upcycled materials, such as recycled plastic bottles or discarded textiles, but with a unique twist. Each sweater could feature a different artistic design or pattern created from the upcycled materials, making each piece one-of-a-kind. This would not only promote sustainability but also encourage consumers to embrace individuality in their fashion choices.",
    "**Modular Design with Interchangeable Components**:    Design a modular sweater with interchangeable components, such as detachable sleeves, collars, or pockets. This would allow wearers to customize their sweater based on the occasion or their mood. For instance, a sweater could transform from a casual look with short sleeves to a more formal style with long sleeves and a sophisticated collar, all while maintaining comfort.",
    "**Integrated Lighting for Visibility**:    Develop a sweater with integrated LED lighting along the seams or in fun patterns. This feature would enhance visibility for outdoor activities during low-light conditions, such as jogging at dusk or walking in the evening. The lights could be rechargeable and controlled via a smartphone app, allowing users to choose different colors or patterns based on their preferences."
