    "**Aerius**: A high-speed vacuum tube transportation system that uses magnetic levitation and advanced propulsion technology to transport passengers at speeds of up to 4,000 km/h (2,500 mph). The system would consist of evacuated tubes with capsules that use electromagnetic forces to propel and suspend the capsules within the tubes. This would eliminate air resistance, allowing for faster travel times and reduced energy consumption.",
    "**Aquasphere**: An underwater transportation system that utilizes a network of pressurized capsules connected by a series of underwater tunnels. The capsules would be designed to accommodate both passengers and cargo, and would be propelled through the tunnels using advanced hydrodynamics and electric motors. This system would enable efficient and environmentally friendly transportation between coastal cities and underwater habitats.",
    "**Graviton**: A space-based transportation system that uses gravitational manipulation technology to create stable wormholes for near-instant travel between destinations. The system would consist of a network of orbiting satellites that generate artificial gravitational fields, allowing for the creation of stable wormholes that can be traversed by spacecraft. This would revolutionize space travel and make interstellar exploration possible.",
    "**Terraverde**: A sustainable and eco-friendly transportation system that utilizes a network of elevated, vacuum-sealed tubes to transport passengers and cargo using advanced magnetic levitation technology. The system would be powered by renewable energy sources, such as solar and wind power, and would significantly reduce greenhouse gas emissions and energy consumption.",
    "**AeroRail**: A hybrid transportation system that combines the efficiency of high-speed rail with the convenience of air travel. The system would consist of elevated, vacuum-sealed tubes that crisscross the globe, with capsules that use magnetic levitation and advanced propulsion technology to reach speeds of up to 4,000 km/h (2,500 mph). The capsules would be designed to accommodate both passengers and cargo, and would be equipped with advanced life support systems and communication technology. This would enable fast, efficient, and environmentally friendly transportation between cities and regions. [/INST] "
