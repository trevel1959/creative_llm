    "**Scented Air Freshener**: Beyond providing light, candles can also be used to freshen up your space. If you have a candle that has lost its scent, you can place it in a warm area (like near a radiator) or light it briefly to release its fragrance. Alternatively, you can melt the wax and mix it with essential oils, creating a custom scent that can be poured into a small container for a DIY air freshener.",
    "**Waterproofing Fabric**: By rubbing a candle over fabric, such as a piece of canvas or a tarp, you can create a waterproof barrier. This is particularly useful for outdoor gear or tents. After applying the wax, you can heat it with a hairdryer or iron (on low heat) to help it penetrate the fabric, making it resistant to moisture.",
    "**Temporary Wood Filler**: If you have a small scratch or dent in wooden furniture, you can use the wax from a candle as a temporary filler. Just melt the wax slightly and pour it into the scratch, allowing it to harden. This can help to mask imperfections until you can properly refinish the surface.",
    "**Zipper Lubricant**: If you have a stubborn zipper that’s hard to pull, a candle can come to the rescue. Rubbing the wax along the teeth of the zipper can provide a quick fix, making it glide smoothly. This is especially useful for zippers on jackets, bags, or tents that tend to get stuck.",
    "**DIY Crayon**: If you have leftover candle stubs, you can repurpose them into homemade crayons. Simply melt the wax and pour it into crayon molds or ice cube trays, adding non-toxic pigments if desired. Once cooled, you’ll have unique, colorful crayons that can be used for art projects or kids’ crafts."
