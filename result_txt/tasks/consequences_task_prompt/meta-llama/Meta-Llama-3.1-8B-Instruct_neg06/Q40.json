    "**The Rise of a New Class System**: With diseases cured, the concept of \"sickness\" as a social stigma would disappear. However, a new class system could emerge based on other factors, such as genetic predispositions, cognitive abilities, or physical characteristics.",
    "**The End of Mortality**: With diseases cured, the concept of mortality would need to be reevaluated. People might live longer, healthier lives, but the question of what it means to be \"old\" or \"dying\" would need to be redefined.",
    "**The Loss of Purpose**: With diseases cured, the sense of purpose and meaning that often comes from fighting against illness and disease would be lost. People might struggle to find new reasons to contribute to society and make a positive impact."
