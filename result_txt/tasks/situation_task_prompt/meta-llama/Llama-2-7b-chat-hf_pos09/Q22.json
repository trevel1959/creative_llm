    "Floating Transportation: With all roads disappearing, you could use a network of interconnected floating platforms to move around the town or city. These platforms could be powered by solar panels or wind turbines, providing a clean and sustainable means of transportation. Each platform could have designated lanes for different types of vehicles, such as cars, buses, and bicycles, to ensure efficient and safe transportation.",
    "Magnetic Vehicles: In a world without roads, magnetic levitation technology could be used to create vehicles that float above the ground. These vehicles could be powered by electricity and propelled by magnetic fields, allowing for smooth and quiet movement. The magnetic fields could also be used to guide the vehicles and prevent collisions, ensuring a safe and efficient transportation system.",
    "Airborne Cargo Delivery: With all roads disappearing, a new system of airborne cargo delivery could be established. Drones or airships could be used to transport goods and supplies between locations, reducing the need for traditional roads and increasing the speed and efficiency of delivery. This system could also be used for emergency supplies and medical transportation, providing a vital lifeline in times of crisis.",
    "Subterranean Tunnels: In the absence of roads, a network of subterranean tunnels could be built to connect different parts of the town or city. These tunnels could be used for both transportation and utilities, providing a safe and efficient means of moving people and goods. The tunnels could be powered by renewable energy sources, such as geothermal or solar power, to minimize environmental impact.",
    "Personal Gravity Propulsion: In a world without roads, personal gravity propulsion devices could be developed to allow individuals to move around with ease. These devices could use advanced magnetic or gravitational technology to create a localized field that counteracts the force of gravity, allowing users to float or move in any direction they choose. This technology could revolutionize personal transportation, providing a safe and efficient means of getting around without the need for roads."
