    "Gestures and Body Language: In a world without language, humans would rely heavily on non-verbal communication, such as hand gestures, facial expressions, and body language. People could use these visual cues to convey emotions, ideas, and intentions. For example, a person could raise their eyebrows to indicate curiosity or surprise, or use a thumbs-up gesture to indicate approval.",
    "Visual Storytelling: People could use drawings, paintings, or other forms of visual art to convey stories and ideas. This could include illustrating scenes from daily life, telling myths and legends, or depicting important events. Visual storytelling could be a powerful way to pass on knowledge and cultural traditions.",
    "Music and Sound: Music has long been a universal language, transcending cultural and linguistic barriers. In a world without language, people could use music to communicate emotions and ideas. They could compose songs or melodies to convey messages, tell stories, or evoke emotions. Music could also be used to coordinate actions or signal important events.",
    "Dance: Dance has been used throughout history as a form of non-verbal communication. In a world without language, people could use dance to convey emotions, tell stories, or convey information.
