    "Floating Cities: One creative solution to accommodate a drastic rise in ocean levels would be to construct floating cities. These cities would be built on large platforms or islands that could float on the water, providing a stable and habitable environment for inhabitants. The platforms could be designed to resemble traditional cities, complete with residential areas, commercial districts, and public spaces.",
    "Underwater Bases: Another option would be to build underwater bases, where people could live and work in a submerged environment. These bases could be designed to mimic the layout of traditional cities, with residential areas, laboratories, and other facilities. The underwater environment could also provide a unique opportunity for scientific research and exploration.",
    "Floating Gardens: For a more sustainable and eco-friendly option, floating gardens could be created to provide a habitat for people and wildlife. These gardens could be built on a series of interconnected platforms, with a variety of plants and trees growing on each platform. The gardens could provide a natural habitat for marine life, while also providing a safe and peaceful living space for humans.",
    "Artificial Islands: Artificial islands could be created using advanced technology to provide a stable and habitable environment for people. These islands could be built using materials such as sand, gravel, or even recycled materials, and could be designed to resemble traditional islands or be entirely new creations. The artificial islands could provide a unique living space for people, with a variety of amenities and activities available.",
    "Submersible Cities: For a truly futuristic solution, submersible cities could be built that are completely submerged in the ocean. These cities could be designed to mimic the layout of traditional cities, with residential areas, commercial districts, and public spaces. The submersible cities could be powered by advanced technology, such as solar panels or nuclear reactors, and could provide a unique and sustainable living environment for people."
