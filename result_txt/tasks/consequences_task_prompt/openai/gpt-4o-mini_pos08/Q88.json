    "**Innovative Policy Approaches**: Women leaders might bring fresh perspectives to governance, leading to innovative policy solutions. For instance, they may advocate for family-friendly policies such as paid parental leave and flexible working arrangements, recognizing the importance of balancing work and family life. Such initiatives could contribute to higher workforce participation rates and economic growth."
