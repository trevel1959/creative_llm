    "**Creative Hair Accessories**: Develop a hairbrush that doubles as a fashion accessory. The brush can be designed in various shapes and sizes to complement different hairstyles. For instance, it could have a sleek, modern design that looks like a small piece of jewelry when not in use, or a whimsical shape like a unicorn horn or a butterfly. This could be especially appealing for those who value both functionality and style in their personal grooming products.",
    "**Smart Hairbrush**: Create an advanced hairbrush that includes sensors and micro-motors to analyze hair health and provide personalized grooming advice. It could measure factors like scalp condition, hair strength, and even stress levels (via heart rate variability) to suggest treatments or changes in routine. The data collected could be synced with a smartphone app, offering tips on hair care, styling, and diet modifications.",
    "**Portable Charging Hairbrush**: Design a hairbrush that is powered by solar panels or a mini battery pack. This would be particularly useful for individuals who travel frequently or live in areas with limited access to electricity. Users could charge the hairbrush during sunny days or use the built-in battery for charging mobile devices when needed, making it a versatile tool for everyday life.",
    "**Ergonomic Hairbrush for Seniors**: Focus on creating a hairbrush that accommodates the needs of older adults who may have arthritis or reduced hand strength. The brush could have a larger, more comfortable grip, softer bristles, and possibly even a vibrating feature to help ease tension in the scalp. Additionally, it might include a magnifying mirror or LED lights for better visibility while styling.",
    "**Scented Hairbrush**: Introduce a hairbrush that incorporates fragrance technology, allowing users to choose from various scents or have the brush release a subtle scent like lavender or mint each time they brush their hair. This could enhance the overall grooming experience and provide a relaxing effect, particularly beneficial for those looking for aromatherapy benefits during their morning routine."
