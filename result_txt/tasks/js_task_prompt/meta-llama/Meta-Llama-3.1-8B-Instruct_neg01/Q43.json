    "**Wall- Walking Explorer**: I would use this power to explore abandoned buildings, ruins, and other hidden spaces that are inaccessible to the general public. I'd walk through walls to uncover secrets, hidden rooms, and mysterious artifacts. This would not only be an adventure but also a way to document and preserve history. I'd create a YouTube channel or a podcast to share my findings with the world.",
    "**Home Security Specialist**: With the ability to see through walls, I'd offer my services as a home security consultant. I'd help homeowners identify potential vulnerabilities in their walls, such as hidden gaps or weaknesses in the structure, and provide recommendations for improvement. This would not only enhance home safety but also provide peace of mind for homeowners.",
    "**Underground Utility Locator**: I'd use this power to locate and map underground utility lines, pipes, and cables. This would be particularly useful for construction projects, utility companies, and emergency responders. By visualizing the underground infrastructure, I'd help prevent accidents, reduce costs, and improve efficiency.",
    "**Artistic Expression**: I'd use my ability to see through walls to create innovative and immersive art installations. By visualizing the hidden spaces and structures within buildings, I'd design interactive exhibits that challenge people's perceptions of architecture and the built environment. This would be a unique way to engage audiences and spark conversations about the relationship between art and architecture.",
    "**Environmental Investigator**: With the power to see through walls, I'd investigate environmental issues such as pollution, contamination, and climate change. I'd use this ability to detect hidden pollutants, track the flow of pollutants through walls and soil, and identify areas of high environmental risk. This would inform policy decisions, guide environmental remediation efforts, and help mitigate the effects of climate change."
