    "Unemployment: One potential consequence of all wars ending suddenly is a significant reduction in the military and defense industry workforce. With no more wars to fight, millions of soldiers, military personnel, and defense contractors would find themselves without jobs. This could lead to widespread unemployment and economic disruption, particularly in countries that rely heavily on the military industry. Confidence Score: 0.8",
    "Refugee Crisis: Another possible consequence of all wars ending is a massive influx of refugees. As wars cease, people who have been displaced or forced to flee their homes may return to their countries of origin, leading to a significant strain on resources and infrastructure. This could result in a humanitarian crisis, as countries struggle to accommodate and provide for the newly displaced individuals. Confidence Score: 0.9",
    "Power Vacuum: With the end of wars, the power structures that have been in place during times of conflict may collapse. This could lead to a power vacuum, as various factions and groups vie for control in the absence of a central authority. This could result in political instability, as well as the potential for new conflicts to arise from the struggle for power. Confidence Score: 0.8",
    "Economic Boom: On the other hand, the end of wars could also lead to a significant economic boom. With the resources previously dedicated to war efforts now available for other purposes, there could be a surge in investment and innovation. This could lead to increased economic growth and development, as well as improved living standards for people around the world. Confidence Score: 0.9",
    "New Global Order: The end of wars could also mark the beginning of a new global order. With the old power structures no longer in place, there could be a shift towards a more cooperative and peaceful global society. This could lead to increased international cooperation and the establishment of new global institutions dedicated to promoting peace and security. Confidence Score: 0.9"
