    "**Solar-Powered Emergency Lanterns**: Develop compact, portable, and efficient solar-powered lanterns that can be easily charged during the day. These lanterns would provide reliable and sustainable light for at least 12 hours, using advanced solar panels and energy storage systems. The lanterns could be designed with a built-in battery backup system, allowing them to function even on cloudy days or during periods of low sunlight.",
    "**LED Light-Infused Window Film**: Design a specialized window film that incorporates LED lights, allowing windows to double as a light source. This film could be applied to any window, providing a unique and energy-efficient way to illuminate spaces. The LED lights could be programmed to adjust brightness and color temperature to simulate natural daylight, reducing the need for artificial lighting.",
    "**Bioluminescent Plant-Based Lighting**: Research and develop bioluminescent plants that can be grown indoors, providing a sustainable and self-sustaining light source. These plants would absorb CO2 and release oxygen while emitting a soft, warm glow. This innovative approach would not only provide light but also contribute to a healthier indoor environment.",
    "**Kinetic Energy Harvesting Lighting**: Create a system that harnesses kinetic energy from everyday activities, such as footsteps or vibrations, to generate electricity for lighting. This could be achieved through advanced piezoelectric materials or electromagnetic induction. The system would be integrated into flooring or walls, providing a unique and innovative way to power lighting.",
    "**Atmospheric Water Vapor Condensation Lighting**: Develop a device that condenses atmospheric water vapor into liquid water, which is then used to generate electricity through a fuel cell or electrolysis. This electricity would power LED lights, providing a sustainable and self-sufficient lighting solution. The device could be designed to be compact and portable, making it suitable for emergency or off-grid applications."
