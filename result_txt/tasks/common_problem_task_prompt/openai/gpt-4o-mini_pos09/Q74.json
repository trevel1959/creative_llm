    "**Weather Conditions**: Adverse weather conditions, such as high winds, thunderstorms, or lightning, can pose serious threats to a satellite launch. If the weather is not suitable, it could delay the launch or lead to a decision to abort the mission. To address this, meteorological teams must continuously monitor weather patterns leading up to the launch, and backup launch windows should be established.",
    "**Regulatory Compliance**: Launching a satellite involves navigating a complex web of regulatory requirements from various authorities, including national and international space agencies. Failing to comply with these regulations can result in legal repercussions or launch delays. To prevent this, thorough research and communication with regulatory bodies should be prioritized during the planning phase.",
    "**Orbital Debris Collision**: The risk of collision with existing orbital debris is a growing concern for satellite launches. A collision could damage the satellite or cause it to malfunction. To mitigate this risk, teams can utilize tracking systems to monitor debris and adjust the satellite's trajectory if necessary. Additionally, designing satellites with debris mitigation strategies can further reduce this risk.",
    "**Supply Chain Disruptions**: The launch of a satellite requires numerous components and materials, and any disruption in the supply chain can lead to delays or increased costs. Issues such as natural disasters, geopolitical tensions, or pandemics can affect the availability of critical components. To counter this, companies should diversify their suppliers and maintain an inventory of essential parts to ensure continuity.",
    "**Funding and Budget Constraints**: Launching a satellite is a capital-intensive endeavor, and budget overruns or funding shortages can threaten the mission. Unexpected costs, such as increased material prices or additional testing requirements, can arise. To manage this, a robust financial plan should be established, including contingency funds and clear communication with stakeholders regarding potential risks."
