    "**Augmented Reality Overlay**: Integrate augmented reality (AR) capabilities into the television. Viewers could wear AR glasses or use their smartphones to see additional content overlaid on the screen, such as character backgrounds, trivia, or interactive elements related to the show. For example, while watching a cooking show, viewers could see the recipe ingredients and nutritional information appear in real-time.",
    "**Mood-Responsive Features**: Develop a television that can detect the mood of the viewers through facial recognition or voice analysis. Based on this data, the TV could suggest shows, adjust brightness, and even change the color of the screen to enhance the viewing experience. For instance, if it detects that viewers are stressed, it might suggest a calming nature documentary and adjust the screen to softer colors.",
    "**Multi-Sensory Experience**: Create a television that engages multiple senses beyond sight and sound. Incorporate scent emitters that release aromas related to the content being watched, such as the smell of popcorn during a movie or the scent of rain during a nature documentary. Additionally, integrate haptic feedback devices that vibrate or simulate physical sensations during action scenes, making viewers feel more immersed.",
    "**Personalized Viewing Pods**: Design modular viewing pods that can be customized for individual preferences. These pods could be equipped with adjustable screens, surround sound systems, and personalized lighting to create an immersive environment tailored to each viewer. Family members can have their own pods that can be connected for group viewing or separated for individual experiences.",
    "**Content Creation Mode**: Introduce a feature that allows viewers to create their own content directly from their television. This could include editing tools for videos, voiceovers, and even basic animation capabilities. Users could share their creations with friends or upload them to a community platform, turning passive viewers into active content creators."
