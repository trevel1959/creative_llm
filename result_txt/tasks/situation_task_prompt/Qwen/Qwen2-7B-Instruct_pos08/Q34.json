    "**Rainwater Harvesting System**: Build a rainwater harvesting system that collects rainwater during rainy seasons. This system could include gutters, downspouts, storage tanks, and filtration systems. The collected water can then be used to water your plants when there's no rain.",
    "**Recycling and Reusing Water**: Implement a system where used water from your household activities (e.g., washing dishes, showering) is collected and treated for reuse in your garden. Use a simple water purification method such as sedimentation or filtration. This water can be used to water your plants during dry spells.",
    "**Aquaponics**: Create an aquaponics system where fish waste provides nutrients for plants, and plants filter the water for the fish. This self-sustaining system requires less water than traditional gardening methods and can provide a steady supply of water for your plants.",
    "**Water Storage Tanks**: Install large water storage tanks underground or above ground to collect and store water from sources like wells, cisterns, or treated greywater. You can then pump this water into your garden when needed.",
    "**Drip Irrigation**: Set up a drip irrigation system that delivers water directly to the base of each plant. This minimizes water loss due to evaporation and runoff, ensuring that the water goes directly to the roots where it is needed. You can use timers to automate the watering process, ensuring your plants receive the appropriate amount of water at the right time."
