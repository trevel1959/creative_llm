    "**Language Barriers**: Language differences can hinder effective communication and lead to misunderstandings. To address this, the summit could utilize real-time translation services and hire interpreters fluent in the languages of all delegations. Additionally, providing materials in multiple languages beforehand can ensure all participants are on the same page.",

    "**Logistical Challenges**: Coordinating travel, accommodations, and schedules for delegates from various countries can be complex. To streamline this process, organizers could create a centralized online platform for registration and travel arrangements, providing clear instructions and assistance for participants. Additionally, contingency plans should be in place for potential delays or changes in travel plans.",
    "**Diverse Political Agendas**: Participants may come with conflicting political agendas, making consensus difficult. To facilitate productive discussions, pre-summit workshops could be organized to identify common goals and establish a foundation for dialogue. Utilizing skilled mediators to guide discussions can also help in navigating contentious topics and finding common ground.",
    "**Sustainability Concerns**: Organizing large events can have a significant environmental impact. To address sustainability, the summit could prioritize eco-friendly practices, such as sourcing local food, minimizing waste through recycling initiatives, and using digital materials instead of printed ones.
