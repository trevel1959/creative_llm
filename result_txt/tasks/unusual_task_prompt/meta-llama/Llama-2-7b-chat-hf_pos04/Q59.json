    "Hose-Based Art Installation: Create a large-scale art installation that utilizes garden hoses as the primary medium. The installation could take the form of a sprawling, winding pathway or a series of interconnected \"rooms\" filled with flowing water. The hoses could be colored or patterned to create a visually striking display, and could even incorporate LED lights or other interactive elements.",
    "Hose-Powered Irrigation System: Design a hose-based irrigation system that can be used in small-scale agricultural applications, such as in greenhouses or small gardens. The system could use a series of hoses to deliver water directly to the roots of plants, reducing water waste and improving crop yields.",
    "Hose-Based Exercise Equipment: Create a line of exercise equipment that utilizes garden hoses as resistance bands. Users could perform a variety of exercises, such as bicep curls or shoulder presses, by grasping the hoses and pulling them in different directions. The hoses could be adjustable in length and resistance level to accommodate users of different fitness levels.",
    "Hose-Based Musical Instrument: Design a musical instrument that utilizes garden hoses as the primary sound-producing element. The instrument could take the form of a large, hose-based flute, with different lengths and diameters of hose producing different notes. Users could play the instrument by blowing into one end of the hose, creating a unique and soothing sound.",
    "Hose-Based Fountain: Create a large-scale fountain that utilizes garden hoses as the primary water source. The fountain could take the form of a central \"heart\" of hoses, with water flowing outward through a series of smaller hoses and nozzles. The hoses could be arranged in a spiral or circular pattern, creating a visually striking display of water and sound. The fountain could be illuminated at night with colored LED lights, creating a magical and memorable display."
