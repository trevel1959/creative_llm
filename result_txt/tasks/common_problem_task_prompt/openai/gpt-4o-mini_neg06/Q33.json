    "**Shelter Construction**: Building a shelter that can protect against the elements (rain, wind, sun) is essential. The challenge lies in finding suitable materials and a safe location. Without prior experience, it may be difficult to create a structure that provides adequate insulation and protection. To overcome this, one could use natural resources like palm fronds and driftwood, while considering the island's terrain and potential hazards like falling branches or flooding.",
    "**Navigation and Communication**: If the island is remote, the risk of not being found increases. Without a way to signal for help or navigate back to civilization, survival becomes more complicated. One creative solution is to create large SOS signals on the beach using rocks or logs, and to make smoke signals using a fire during the day. Learning about the stars for navigation at night can also help if there is a need to explore the island.",
    "**Health Risks**: The potential for injury or illness is heightened in a survival situation. Cuts, scrapes, or insect bites can become infected without proper care. Additionally, exposure to the elements can lead to hypothermia or heat exhaustion. A proactive approach would be to develop natural remedies from the island's plants for minor injuries and to create a first aid kit from available materials, like using large leaves as bandages.",
    "**Psychological Strain**: Isolation can take a toll on mental health. Loneliness, fear, and despair can lead to poor decision-making and a decrease in morale. To combat this, establishing a daily routine can provide structure, while journaling or creating art from natural materials can serve as emotional outlets. Practicing mindfulness or meditation can also help maintain a positive mental state.",
    "**Wildlife Encounters**: The presence of wild animals can pose threats, whether they are predators or simply pests. Learning to identify dangerous species and understanding their behavior is crucial. One could create a perimeter around the shelter using rocks or thorny branches to deter animals, while also ensuring food is stored securely to avoid attracting unwanted visitors."
