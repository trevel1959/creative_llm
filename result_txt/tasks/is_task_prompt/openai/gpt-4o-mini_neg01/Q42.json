    "As the dawn broke, the world stirred awake to the rhythmic sound of the Snoring Sun. It was said that when the sun snored, dreams danced across the sky, painting vibrant colors that awakened the sleepy townsfolk. Children laughed as they chased the shimmering rays, while elders sat on porches, reminiscing about their own dreams. But one day, the sun's snores grew louder, and clouds gathered, threatening to drown the colors. In a desperate attempt, the townspeople gathered, singing lullabies to soothe the sun back to sleep. As it quieted, the colors returned, and peace settled once more over the land.",
