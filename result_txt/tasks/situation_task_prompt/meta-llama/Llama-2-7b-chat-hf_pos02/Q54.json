    "Hydrofoils: Hydrofoils are boats that use wings or foils to lift the hull of the boat out of the water, reducing drag and increasing speed. Without ships and boats, hydrofoils could be a viable option for traveling across large bodies of water. They could be powered by electric or hybrid engines, making them more environmentally friendly.",
    "Personal Submarines: Personal submarines are small, portable underwater vessels that can accommodate one or a few people. They could be used to travel across large bodies of water without the need for a large boat or ship. These submarines could be powered by electric or diesel-electric propulsion systems and could be equipped with advanced navigation and communication systems.",
    "Seagliders: Seagliders are small, wing-like devices that use the wind and currents to glide across the water. They could be used to travel long distances without the need for a large boat or ship. Seagliders could be powered by solar panels or small electric motors, making them a sustainable option for traveling across large bodies of water.",
    "Water Bikes: Water bikes are bicycles that are designed to be used on water instead of land. They could be used to travel across large bodies of water without the need for a large boat or ship. Water bikes could be powered by pedaling or by electric motors, making them a fun and sustainable option for traveling across the water.",
    "Aqua Sleds: Aqua sleds are small, inflatable vessels that are designed to be pulled by a person on a board or by a tow rope. They could be used to travel across large bodies of water without the need for a large boat or ship. Aqua sleds could be powered by the person pulling them or by small electric motors, making them a sustainable and fun option for traveling across the water."
