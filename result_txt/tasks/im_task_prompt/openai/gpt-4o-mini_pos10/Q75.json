    "**Interchangeable Plates**:    Design the sandwich toaster with interchangeable cooking plates that allow users to create different types of sandwiches, such as paninis, waffles, or even stuffed pancakes. These plates could be non-stick and dishwasher-safe for easy cleaning. The plates could also have different textures (grill, smooth, etc.) to create unique sandwich experiences.",
    "**Built-in Ingredient Dispenser**:    Incorporate a built-in ingredient dispenser that allows users to add fillings directly into the sandwich while it toasts. The dispenser could have compartments for cheese, vegetables, and sauces, allowing for customized sandwiches without the mess. A user-friendly interface would let users select their desired fillings and portion sizes.",
    "**Dual-Sided Cooking**:    Create a dual-sided sandwich toaster that can toast two sandwiches at once, with independent temperature controls for each side. This feature would allow users to prepare different types of sandwiches simultaneously, catering to different tastes or dietary preferences within a single household.",
    "**Recipe Suggestion Feature**:    Add a digital display that suggests sandwich recipes based on the ingredients users have on hand. By scanning barcodes or inputting items manually, the toaster could recommend unique combinations and cooking times, encouraging culinary creativity. This feature could also include a community aspect where users can share their favorite recipes.",
    "**Self-Cleaning Mechanism**:    Implement a self-cleaning mechanism that uses steam and high temperatures to sanitize the interior of the toaster after use. This would help eliminate grease and food particles, making maintenance effortless. A simple button could activate the cleaning cycle, and users would only need to wipe down the exterior afterward."
