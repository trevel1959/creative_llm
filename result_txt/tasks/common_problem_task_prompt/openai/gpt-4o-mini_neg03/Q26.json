    "**Weather Conditions**: Mount Everest is notorious for its unpredictable weather, which can change rapidly and dramatically. Sudden storms can lead to whiteouts, extreme cold, and high winds, putting climbers at risk. To address this, climbers could utilize a smart weather monitoring device that provides real-time updates and forecasts specific to their location, allowing them to make informed decisions about when to ascend or descend.",
    "**Avalanches and Icefall Hazards**: The Khumbu Icefall and surrounding areas are prone to avalanches and falling ice. These natural hazards can occur without warning and pose a significant risk to climbers. A potential solution could involve the use of drones equipped with thermal imaging and structural analysis technology to monitor the stability of ice formations and predict potential avalanche activity.",
    "**Overcrowding and Route Congestion**: In recent years, the number of climbers attempting to summit Everest has increased, leading to dangerous congestion on the climbing routes, particularly during peak season. This can result in long wait times, which increase the risk of exhaustion and exposure to harsh conditions. To alleviate this issue, a digital reservation system could be implemented that limits the number of climbers allowed on the mountain at any given time, ensuring a safer and more manageable climbing experience.",
    "**Environmental Impact**: The increasing number of climbers has raised concerns about the environmental impact on Everest, including waste management and pollution. A creative approach could involve establishing a \"Leave No Trace\" initiative that includes a deposit system where climbers pay a fee that is refunded upon proof of waste removal from the mountain, incentivizing climbers to take care of the environment.",
    "**Inexperienced Climbers**: The allure of summiting Everest can attract climbers with insufficient experience or training, leading to dangerous situations. To combat this, a certification program could be developed that requires climbers to demonstrate specific skills and knowledge before being allowed to attempt the ascent. This program could include practical training in mountaineering techniques, survival skills, and emergency response."
