    "**Smart Mouse with Integrated Biometric Security**: Imagine a computer mouse that doubles as a biometric authentication device. The mouse would have a built-in fingerprint reader, facial recognition camera, or even a vein recognition sensor. When a user wants to log in to their computer, they simply place their finger or face in front of the mouse, and the device verifies their identity. This adds an extra layer of security to the traditional password or PIN system. The mouse could also be integrated with a smart home system, allowing users to unlock their doors, turn on lights, or control other smart devices with a simple gesture.",
    "**Haptic Feedback Mouse for Gamers**: A haptic feedback mouse would provide gamers with a more immersive experience. The mouse would have tiny motors that create vibrations, tactile feedback, and even temperature changes to simulate the sensations of a real-world environment. For example, when a player is in a hot desert, the mouse would vibrate and heat up to simulate the sensation of sand beneath their feet. This technology could also be used to create more realistic gaming experiences, such as simulating the feel of a gun or the sensation of a character's movements.",
    "**Ergonomic Mouse with Built-in Posture Correction**: An ergonomic mouse with built-in posture correction would help users maintain proper posture while working or gaming. The mouse would have sensors that track the user's posture and provide real-time feedback through vibrations, lights, or even a built-in display. If the user slouches or leans forward, the mouse would alert them to adjust their posture. The mouse could also be designed to adjust its shape and size to fit the user's hand, promoting a comfortable and natural grip.",
    "**Wireless Mouse with Integrated Charging Station**: A wireless mouse with an integrated charging station would eliminate the need for separate charging cables or stations. The mouse would have a small charging pad built into its base, allowing users to simply place the mouse on the pad to charge. This would be especially useful for users who work or travel frequently, as they could easily charge their mouse on the go. The charging station could also be designed to hold other devices, such as smartphones or earbuds.",
    "**Adaptive Mouse for Users with Disabilities**: An adaptive mouse would be designed for users with disabilities, such as arthritis, Parkinson's disease, or paralysis. The mouse would have a variety of features that allow users to interact with their computer in a more accessible way. For example, the mouse could have a large,"
