    "**Inadequate Cooling**: Insufficient cooling can cause the computer to overheat, leading to damage to the components and potentially causing a fire. To mitigate this risk, it's crucial to select a suitable cooling system, such as a liquid cooling system or a high-quality air cooling system.",
    "**Incompatible Components**: Choosing components that are not compatible with each other can lead to installation issues, reduced performance, and even render the computer unusable. To avoid this, it's essential to research and verify the compatibility of each component before purchasing.",
    "**Electrical Safety**: When building a computer, there's a risk of electrical shock or fire due to improper handling of electrical components. To minimize this risk, it's crucial to follow proper electrical safety procedures, such as grounding the system and using surge protectors.",
    "**Warranty and Support**: When building a computer from scratch, the warranty and support options may be limited compared to purchasing a pre-built computer. This can lead to difficulties in resolving any issues that may arise. To mitigate this, it's essential to research the warranty and support options for each component before purchasing.",
    "**Space Constraints**: Building a computer in a small space can be challenging, especially when working with large components such as the power supply or graphics card. To overcome this, it's essential to plan the layout of the components carefully and consider using a compact case or a custom-built enclosure."
