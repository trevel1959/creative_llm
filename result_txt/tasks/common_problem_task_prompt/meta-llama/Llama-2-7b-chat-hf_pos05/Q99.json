This technology can be especially useful for individuals who are learning braille or who need to read text in braille for everyday tasks.",
    "AI-Powered Object Recognition: This technology uses artificial intelligence and computer vision to recognize objects in the user's surroundings and provide audio or tactile feedback to help them identify the objects. For example, the technology could recognize a door and provide a tactile signal to indicate that it is a door, or recognize a person and provide an audio signal to identify them.",
    "Virtual Reality Mobility Training: Virtual reality technology can be used to provide immersive mobility training for visually impaired individuals. The training program can simulate real-world environments, such as a grocery store or a park, and provide audio or haptic feedback to help the user navigate the environment. This can help individuals build confidence and independence in their daily mobility.",
    "Smart Contact Lenses: These contact lenses are designed with a built-in camera and sensors that can detect objects and people in the user's surroundings. The lenses can provide real-time audio or haptic feedback to help the user navigate their surroundings, and can also be connected to a smartphone or other device to provide additional information and assistance.
