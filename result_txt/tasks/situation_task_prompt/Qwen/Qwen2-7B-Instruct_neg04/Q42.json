    "**Building a Shelter:** Upon waking up on a deserted island, your first priority should be to build a shelter to protect yourself from the elements. You can construct a simple shelter using natural resources like branches, leaves, and vines. Ensure that it's elevated off the ground to avoid potential water sources, and make sure it has a sturdy roof to shield you from rain and strong winds.",
    "**Creating Tools:** To survive, you'll need tools to help gather food, start fires, and create other useful items. You can use stones, sticks, and shells to make a variety of tools such as knives, spears, and fishing hooks. Learning basic stone tool-making techniques can significantly increase your chances of survival.",
    "**Locating Fresh Water:** Access to clean drinking water is crucial for survival. You can find fresh water by digging near a source of saltwater or collecting rainwater in containers made from leaves or bark. Building a water trap by digging a hole and covering it with a clear plastic sheet can also help collect rainwater.",
    "**Gathering Food:** To ensure a steady food supply, learn how to identify edible plants, fruits, and nuts on the island. Additionally, catch fish by making traps or using your spear. If there are no fish, try to hunt for small animals like birds, insects, or even crabs if they're available.",
    "**Making Fire:** A reliable source of fire can keep you warm, cook food, and help ward off predators. Start by creating a fire pit and gathering dry wood, twigs, and leaves. Use friction methods like rubbing two sticks together or using a bow drill to ignite the tinder. If you have a lighter or matches, these can be invaluable for starting fires quickly."
