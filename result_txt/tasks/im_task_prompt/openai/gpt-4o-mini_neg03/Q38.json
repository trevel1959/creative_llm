    "**Modular Design Sweater**: Create a sweater with detachable sleeves, collars, or even sections of the body that can be interchanged or removed. This would allow wearers to customize their look and adapt to changing weather conditions. For example, on a warmer day, users could opt to wear just the body of the sweater without sleeves, while on colder days, they could attach the sleeves for added warmth.",
    "**Built-in Pocket for Tech**: Design a sweater with a discreet, built-in pocket specifically for tech gadgets like smartphones, earbuds, or even a small power bank. The pocket could have a cable management system that allows users to charge their devices while wearing the sweater, keeping them secure and accessible without the need for a bulky bag.",
    "**Mood-Enhancing Color-Changing Fabric**: Utilize innovative fabric technology that can change color based on the wearer’s mood or surrounding environment. This could be achieved through thermochromic or photochromic materials that react to temperature or light. For example, the sweater could shift to warmer tones in cooler settings, creating a visually appealing effect that reflects the wearer’s emotions or enhances their mood.",
    "**Eco-Friendly Reversible Sweater**: Create a sweater made from sustainable materials that is reversible, offering two different styles in one garment. This would not only reduce the need for multiple sweaters but also promote eco-conscious fashion. One side could feature a bold design while the other could be more subtle, allowing wearers to switch up their look easily.",
    "**Integrated Fitness Tracker**: Incorporate a fitness tracker into the sweater that monitors heart rate, calories burned, and activity levels. The technology could be woven into the fabric, providing a seamless look without the bulk of traditional fitness wearables. Data could be synced to a mobile app, helping users keep track of their health and fitness goals while wearing a stylish sweater."
