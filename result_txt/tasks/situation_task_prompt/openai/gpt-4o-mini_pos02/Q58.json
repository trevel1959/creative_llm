    "**Microbial Pest Control**: Develop a range of beneficial microbes that can be applied to crops and gardens. These microbes would specifically target pest species, either by outcompeting them for resources or by infecting them with disease. For instance, a strain of bacteria that targets aphids could be engineered to thrive in agricultural settings, thereby reducing aphid populations without harming beneficial insects or plants.",
    "**Robotic Predators**: Design small, autonomous robotic devices that mimic the behavior of natural predators. For example, tiny drones that look and move like birds or bats could be deployed to hunt down and scare away insects. These robots could use sound or light to attract insects, creating a safe and non-toxic way to manage pest populations.",
    "**Insect-Repelling Plant Varieties**: Engineer hybrid plants that produce natural repellents. For example, plants could be modified to emit scents that are naturally repulsive to common pests like mosquitoes and ticks. By integrating these plants into gardens and urban areas, they could act as a natural barrier against pests while also enhancing biodiversity.",
    "**Smart Environmental Sensors**: Develop a network of smart sensors that monitor pest populations in real-time. These sensors could track the movements and breeding patterns of pests and send alerts when populations reach a critical threshold. Homeowners and farmers could then take targeted action, using non-toxic methods to control pests based on data-driven insights.",
    "**Companion Planting Workshops**: Organize community workshops focused on companion planting techniques, where participants learn to grow plants that naturally deter pests. For example, teaching how marigolds can repel nematodes or how garlic can ward off aphids would empower individuals to create their own pest-resistant gardens. This approach fosters community engagement and promotes sustainable gardening practices."
