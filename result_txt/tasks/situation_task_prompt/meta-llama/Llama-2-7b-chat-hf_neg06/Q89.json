    "Cellulose-based materials: Cellulose is a renewable and biodegradable polymer found in plant cell walls. With the absence of plastic, designers could utilize cellulose-based materials like cellulose acetate, cellulose nitrate, or even nanocellulose to create sustainable alternatives for plastic products like packaging, clothing, and even building materials.",
    "Bamboo: Bamboo is a highly renewable and sustainable resource that can be used to create a variety of products, from paper and textiles to building materials and even biodegradable plastics. Bamboo has a high cellulose content, making it an ideal substitute for traditional plastics.",
    "Hemp: Hemp is a versatile crop that can be used to create a wide range of products, including textiles, paper, and even bioplastics. Hemp is a highly sustainable crop that requires less water and land than many other crops, making it an attractive alternative to plastic.",
    "Mycelium-based materials: Mycelium is the vegetative part of a fungus, and it has the potential to be used as a sustainable alternative to plastic. Mycelium-based materials can be grown from agricultural waste, and they can be biodegradable and compostable. These materials could be used to create packaging, insulation, and even building materials.",
    "Seaweed-based materials: Seaweed is a highly renewable and sustainable resource that can be used to create a variety of products, from packaging and textiles to building materials and even biodegradable plastics. Seaweed has a high cellulose content, making it an ideal substitute for traditional plastics. Additionally, seaweed requires minimal land and water to grow, making it an attractive alternative to plastic."
