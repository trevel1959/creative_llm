    "Insect Hotels: Design and construct multi-story insect hotels made from sustainable materials like bamboo, straws, or recycled paper. These hotels would provide a habitat for insects to thrive, while also serving as a natural pest control mechanism.",
    "Bug-Based Food Systems: Create a closed-loop system where insects are raised on food waste and other organic matter, providing a sustainable source of protein for both humans and insects. This would reduce the need for traditional livestock farming, minimizing pest problems and promoting a more circular economy.",
    "Insect-Powered Transportation: Develop electric or solar-powered vehicles that utilize insects as a source of energy. For example, a small colony of ants could generate enough power to propel a small car over short distances. This would not only eliminate pests but also provide a clean and sustainable means of transportation.",
    "Insect-Based Medicine: Harness the medicinal properties of insects to create natural remedies for various ailments. For example, the venom of certain spiders and wasps could be used to treat pain, while the saliva of ants could be used to treat infections. This would not only reduce the need for synthetic medicines but also promote a more holistic approach to healthcare.",
    "Insect-Aided Agriculture: Utilize insects as a natural form of pest control in agricultural fields. By introducing beneficial insects, such as ladybugs or lacewings, to crops, these insects would feed on harmful pests, reducing the need for chemical pesticides. This approach would promote a more sustainable and eco-friendly method of agriculture, while also supporting biodiversity."
