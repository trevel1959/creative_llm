    "**Communication Blackout**: The team would need to rely on underwater communication devices, which could be prone to interference or equipment failure. This could lead to a communication blackout, making it difficult for the team to coordinate and respond to emergencies.",
    "**Limited Supply Chain**: The team would need to bring all necessary supplies with them on the mission, which would be heavy and difficult to transport. This could lead to limited supplies and increased risk of running out of essential resources.",
    "**Dive Planning and Navigation**: The team would need to carefully plan and navigate their dives to avoid running out of oxygen, getting lost, or colliding with underwater obstacles. This would require precise calculations and regular updates to their dive plan.",
    "**Psychological Factors**: The isolation and confinement of living at the bottom of the ocean could take a toll on the team's mental health. The team would need to develop strategies to maintain their mental well-being and prevent the effects of prolonged isolation.",
    "**Underwater Hazards**: The team would be exposed to various underwater hazards, such as strong currents, underwater landslides, and marine life encounters. They would need to be trained to recognize and respond to these hazards."
