    "**Natural Ventilation System:** Design a system that utilizes natural forces like wind and temperature differences to regulate indoor temperatures. This could involve large, operable windows that open automatically based on sensors detecting outside conditions. In hot weather, these windows would open to let in cool breezes while blocking out the sun's heat. In colder weather, they would close to retain heat from inside the building. ",
    "**Thermal Mass Walls:** Construct walls using materials with high thermal mass such as concrete or stone. These materials absorb and store heat during the day when the sun is shining and release it slowly at night when temperatures are cooler. This can help maintain a more consistent indoor temperature without relying on mechanical systems.",
    "**Sun-Shading and Reflective Surfaces:** Install sun-shades or reflective surfaces around the exterior of buildings to reflect sunlight away during the hottest parts of the day. This reduces the amount of heat absorbed by the building, helping to keep interior temperatures lower.",
    "**Underground Temperature Regulation:** Utilize the natural cooling effect of underground temperatures. Buildings could have portions built underground where the earth acts as a constant temperature regulator. The deeper into the ground a building extends, the cooler its interior will tend to be, providing a natural way to manage temperatures.",
    "**Water-Based Cooling Systems:** Create a closed-loop water circulation system where water is pumped through pipes under the floor or through walls. The water absorbs heat as it circulates, which can then be released back into the ground or used for other cooling purposes. This system can effectively maintain a cooler indoor environment without needing electricity or traditional HVAC systems."
