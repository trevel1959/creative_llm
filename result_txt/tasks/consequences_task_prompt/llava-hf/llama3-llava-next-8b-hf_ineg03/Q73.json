    "Ecosystem disruption: The loss of animals could also disrupt the balance of ecosystems. For example, herbivores help control the growth of plants, while predators keep the populations of prey species in check. Without these animals, the balance of ecosystems could be severely impacted, leading to an imbalance that could be difficult to restore.",
    "Soil erosion: Many animals play a role in maintaining the structure of soil, such as through their burrowing activities. Without these animals, the soil could become more prone to erosion, which could have significant effects on the stability of landscapes and the quality of water.",
    "Loss of natural fertilizers: Some animals play a role in the natural fertilization of the soil through their droppings. Without these animals, the soil could become less fertile, which could have significant effects on plant growth and overall ecosystem health.",
    "Loss of pollinators: Many animals, including bees and butterflies, play a critical role in the pollination of plants. Without these animals, plant reproduction could be severely impacted, leading to a loss of plant diversity and potentially a decrease in the overall health of ecosystems.",
    "Loss of natural pest control: Many animals, including birds and small mammals, help control insect populations. Without these animals, insect populations could increase, leading to a decrease in the overall health of ecosystems and potentially causing significant damage to crops and other plants."
