    "A Global Language Academy: With everyone speaking the same language, it would be easier to establish a global language academy where individuals from different cultures can come together to learn and master the new language. This would promote cultural exchange and understanding, as people from different backgrounds could learn from each other and share their unique perspectives.",
    "Language Translation Technology: The sudden shift to a single language would likely lead to a surge in investment in language translation technology.

Cultural organizations and language enthusiasts could come together to promote language diversity and support language revitalization efforts.",
    "Identity Crisis: The adoption of a single global language could lead to an identity crisis for individuals who identify strongly with their native language and culture. They may feel that their cultural identity is being erased or marginalized, leading to feelings of loss and disconnection. It would be important to address these concerns and find ways to preserve cultural diversity and identity.",
    "New Forms of Art and Literature: A single global language could lead to new forms of art and literature as artists and writers experiment with the new medium.
