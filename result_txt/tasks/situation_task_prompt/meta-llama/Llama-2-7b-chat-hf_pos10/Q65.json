    "Solar Powered Window Translucent Film: One creative solution would be to use solar-powered window translucent film. This film can be applied to windows and doors, allowing natural light to pass through during the day while providing a soft, diffused glow at night. The film can be charged by the sun during the day and provide light for several hours at night, providing a sustainable and eco-friendly lighting solution.",
    "Bioluminescent Plants: Another creative solution would be to incorporate bioluminescent plants into the room's design. These plants, such as certain species of mushrooms, bacteria, and algae, have the ability to produce their own light. By incorporating these plants into the room's design, they can provide a soft, natural light source at night. This not only provides light but also adds a touch of nature and beauty to the space.",
    "Glowing Paint: A third creative solution would be to use glowing paint on the walls and ceiling of the room. This paint emits a soft, diffused light and can be charged by a small solar panel or a USB port. This would provide a soft, ambient light source that can be adjusted to the desired level of brightness.",
    "LED-Coated Fabrics: Another creative solution would be to use LED-coated fabrics to create a soft, ambient light source. These fabrics can be used for curtains, upholstery, or even furniture cushions. By incorporating LED lights into the fabric, a soft, diffused light can be emitted, providing a warm and inviting ambiance in the room.",
    "Mirrored Surfaces: A final creative solution would be to use mirrored surfaces to reflect light in the room. By placing mirrors on walls, ceilings, and even floors, the light from any source can be reflected and dispersed throughout the room, creating a bright and airy atmosphere. This solution is particularly effective in small or poorly lit spaces, as it can make the room appear larger and brighter than it actually is."
