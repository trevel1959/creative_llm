The retractable blade also makes the scissors safer to handle and store, as it reduces the risk of accidental injury.",
    "Scissors with a temperature-controlled blade: This innovative scissors design includes a special coating on the blade that allows users to adjust the temperature of the blade. This feature would be useful for people who need to cut materials that are sensitive to heat, such as thin plastics or delicate fabrics. By adjusting the temperature of the blade, users can avoid damaging the materials they are cutting.",
    "Scissors with a built-in level: This design includes a built-in level that helps users ensure that the materials they are cutting are perfectly straight and level.

This feature would be especially useful for people who need to cut straight lines, such as carpenters, sign makers, and graphic designers.",
    "Scissors with a magnetic tip: This innovative design features a magnetic tip on the blade of the scissors that can be used to pick up and hold small metal objects, such as paper clips or nails. This feature would be useful for people who need to work with small metal objects in their daily work, such as jewelry makers, craftspeople, and handymen. The magnetic tip also makes it easier to handle and store the scissors, as it prevents the blade"
