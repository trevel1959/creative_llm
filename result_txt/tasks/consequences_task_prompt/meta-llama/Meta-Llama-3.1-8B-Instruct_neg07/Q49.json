Governments, institutions, and social structures would collapse as individuals would be unable to recall laws, rules, and protocols. This would result in a complete breakdown of society, with people resorting to primal survival instincts. In the initial stages, there would be a surge in crime, as individuals would be unable to distinguish right from wrong.

Without the constraints of past experiences and knowledge, artists, musicians, and writers would be free to explore new ideas and forms of expression. This could lead to a new era of artistic innovation, as people would be inspired by their surroundings and the world around them. The lack of memories would also lead to a loss of cultural heritage, but this could be compensated by the emergence of new forms of art and expression.",
