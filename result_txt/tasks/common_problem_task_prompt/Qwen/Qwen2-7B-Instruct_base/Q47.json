    "**DIY Modular Desktop Computer**: Design a modular desktop computer that allows users to customize their system piece by piece. Each component (CPU, motherboard, GPU, RAM, storage) is contained in a separate, easily replaceable module. The modules are interconnected using a standardized interface, allowing for quick assembly and easy upgrades. This concept promotes sustainability and personalization.",
    "**3D Printed Modular PC Case**: Create a 3D printable modular case that can be customized to fit various motherboard sizes and components. Users can print different parts of the case at home and assemble them into a unique, personalized computer enclosure. This approach reduces waste and provides an opportunity for users to express their creativity through design.",
    "**Smartphone-Integrated Portable PC**: Build a portable computer that incorporates smartphone technology. Use a Raspberry Pi or similar device as the main computing unit and integrate it with a smartphone via Bluetooth or USB-C connection. The smartphone can serve as the display, keyboard, and touchpad, turning the Raspberry Pi into a powerful, lightweight computer that's easy to carry around. This concept merges two popular devices and offers versatility for on-the-go computing needs.",
    "**Sustainable Water Cooling System**: Design a computer cooling system that utilizes water as its coolant. This system would be more environmentally friendly than traditional air cooling, as it doesn't require power-hungry fans. The water could be sourced from a nearby water source or even recycled from the computer itself. The water circulation could be powered by renewable energy sources, such as solar panels, further reducing the carbon footprint of the computer.",
    "**Interactive AI-Assisted Assembly**: Develop a virtual reality (VR) application that guides users through the process of building a computer. The user wears VR goggles and interacts with digital components, selecting and placing them in the correct positions while receiving real-time feedback and assistance from an AI. This immersive experience not only makes the process educational but also engaging and enjoyable for those who might find traditional assembly daunting."
