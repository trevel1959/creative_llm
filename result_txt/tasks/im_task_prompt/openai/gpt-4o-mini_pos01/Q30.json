    "**Air Quality Monitoring and Purification**:    - Equip air conditioners with built-in air quality sensors that detect pollutants, allergens, and CO2 levels. The unit could automatically switch to a purification mode when poor air quality is detected, utilizing HEPA filters and UV light technology to clean the air. Users could receive alerts on their smartphones, along with recommendations for improving indoor air quality.",
    "**Personalized Microclimate Zones**:    - Design an air conditioning system that creates personalized microclimates within a single space. By using smart vents and localized cooling units, different areas of a room could maintain different temperatures based on individual preferences, allowing multiple users to coexist comfortably without compromising each other's comfort.",
    "**Eco-Friendly Refrigerants**:    - Develop air conditioners that use innovative, eco-friendly refrigerants that have a lower global warming potential. This could include natural refrigerants like ammonia or hydrocarbons, or new synthetic options that minimize environmental impact. This change would not only improve sustainability but also align with global climate initiatives.",
    "**Energy Harvesting Technology**:    - Integrate energy harvesting technology into air conditioners, allowing them to generate power from their own operation. For example, using thermoelectric generators that convert temperature differences into electricity could help power internal sensors or controls, reducing overall energy consumption and enhancing efficiency.",
    "**Augmented Reality Maintenance Assistance**:    - Implement an augmented reality (AR) feature for maintenance and troubleshooting. Users could wear AR glasses or use a smartphone app that overlays visual instructions and diagnostic information on the air conditioner. This would simplify tasks such as filter replacement, system checks, and troubleshooting, making it easier for users to maintain their units effectively."
