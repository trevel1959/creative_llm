    "**Human-Powered Climbing Ladder System**: You could install a series of ladders connected by ropes or chains that can be manually hauled up by individuals as they ascend. Each floor could have a small platform where people can rest before continuing their climb. This system would require physical strength and endurance but could potentially allow anyone, regardless of age or fitness level, to reach the top.",
    "**Elevated Catwalks and Zip Lines**: Construct a network of elevated catwalks and zip lines between floors. These could be installed temporarily or permanently, depending on the situation. The zip lines would allow for quick movement from one floor to another, while the catwalks provide a safer, slower route. Safety gear would be mandatory for all users.",
    "**Inflatable Ramps**: Inflatable ramps could be deployed between floors using a series of air pumps. These ramps would be made of durable, non-slip materials to ensure safety. People could walk or even crawl up these ramps, which could be inflated in a matter of minutes during an emergency.",
    "**Vertical Staircase Relay Race**: If the building has multiple staircases, you could set up a relay race where individuals run from one staircase to another, passing off a baton to the next person. This would increase the speed at which people can evacuate, as multiple individuals can ascend simultaneously.",
    "**Customized Lifts or Elevator Alternatives**: Design and implement a series of customized lifts or alternative elevators specifically tailored for emergency use. These could include features like hydraulic lifts, pneumatic lifts, or even magnetic levitation systems (maglev). They would need to be robust enough to withstand the conditions of an emergency and could potentially be faster than traditional elevators."
