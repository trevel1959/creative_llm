    "Once in a village nestled between misty mountains, lived a witch named Elara, known for her enchanting spells but lacking a broomstick. Instead, she rode a peculiar inventionâ€”a whimsical cloud made of spun sugar and dreams. The villagers laughed, believing a witch needed a broomstick to be powerful. Undeterred, Elara decided to prove them wrong. One moonlit night, she conjured a storm of colorful fireflies, lighting up the sky like stars. The villagers watched in awe, realizing magic comes in many forms. From that day on, they celebrated Elara, the witch without a broomstick, who taught them that true power lies within.",
