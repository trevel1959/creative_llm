    "Smart Candleholder: Create a candleholder that can detect when a candle is about to burn out and automatically orders a replacement. This can be done through a smartphone app that connects to the candleholder via Bluetooth. The app can track the wax level and send notifications when it's time to restock.",
    "Customizable Candle Design: Develop a candleholder that allows users to create their own custom candle designs using a 3D printer. Users can design their candle using a software program and then print it using the candleholder's built-in 3D printer. This would allow for endless possibilities in terms of design and creativity.",
    "Candlelight Ambiance: Create a candleholder that can adjust the brightness and color of the candlelight based on the user's mood. For example, a warm yellow light could be used for relaxation, while a cool blue light could be used for focus and productivity. This could be achieved through the use of LED lights and a mood-sensing chip.",
    "Scent-Controlled Candleholder: Develop a candleholder that can release different scents based on the user's preferences. This could be done through the use of essential oils or fragrance oils that are stored in a cartridge within the candleholder. The user could simply twist the base of the candleholder to release the desired scent.",
    "Interactive Candleholder: Create a candleholder that can interact with the user through a series of games or challenges. For example, the candleholder could have a built-in motion sensor that detects when the user is nearby, and then light up in a specific pattern or color. The user could then try to replicate the pattern using their own candle, creating a fun and interactive experience."
