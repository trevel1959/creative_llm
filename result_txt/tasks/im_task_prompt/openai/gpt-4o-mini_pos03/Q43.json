    "**Self-Cleaning and Maintenance Alerts**: Enhance the oven with a self-cleaning feature that not only cleans the interior but also alerts users when maintenance is needed. This could include reminders for filter changes, checking seals, or cleaning the vents. By using sensors, the oven could monitor its own performance and notify the user when itâ€™s time for a deep clean or inspection, ensuring optimal functionality and longevity.",
    "**Multi-Zone Cooking Technology**: Design an oven with multiple independent cooking zones, each with adjustable temperature and cooking methods (bake, broil, steam). This would allow users to cook different dishes simultaneously without flavor transfer or temperature interference. Each zone could have its own timer and settings, making it perfect for preparing complex meals.",
    "**Interactive Recipe Screen**: Install a touch-screen display on the oven that allows users to browse recipes, watch cooking tutorials, and even control the oven settings. This screen could connect to the internet, providing access to a vast library of recipes and the ability to save favorites. Users could also share their own recipes and tips, creating a community around the oven.",
    "**Energy Efficiency Mode**: Introduce an energy-saving mode that optimizes cooking time and energy usage. This feature could use sensors to determine the size and type of food being cooked and adjust the heating elements accordingly. Additionally, the oven could have a \"preheat on demand\" function that only preheats when the user is ready to cook, reducing unnecessary energy consumption.",
    "**Built-in Air Fryer and Steamer**: Combine the functionality of an air fryer and a steamer into the oven. This would allow users to enjoy healthier cooking options without needing additional appliances. The oven could come with specialized trays and settings that optimize air circulation for frying or steaming, providing versatility for different cooking styles."
