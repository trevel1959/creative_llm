    "Transportation Revolution: The lack of oil would force a transportation revolution. Electric and hybrid vehicles would become the norm, and cities would need to be redesigned to accommodate for this shift. This would require new infrastructure, such as charging stations, and new roadways that can accommodate for the different size and weight of electric vehicles.",
    "Changes in Agriculture: Oil is used heavily in agriculture for pesticides, fertilizers, and machinery. Without oil, agriculture would need to adapt to new methods, potentially including more organic and sustainable farming practices. This could lead to a shift towards local, small-scale farming and a greater emphasis on sustainable agriculture.",
    "Impact on Economy: The loss of oil would have significant economic implications. Oil is a major export commodity for many countries, and the loss of this industry would lead to a decline in GDP and employment. This would also lead to a shift in the global economy, with some countries gaining from the transition to alternative energy and others losing out.",
    "Impact on Transportation: The lack of oil would lead to a significant shift in transportation. This would require the development of new infrastructure and transportation systems, such as high-speed trains and subways, as well as the development of new types of vehicles that are not reliant on oil.",
    "Impact on Industry: The lack of oil would also have a significant impact on industry. Oil is used as a raw material in many industries, such as plastics, and the loss of this resource would lead to a shift towards alternative materials and manufacturing processes."
