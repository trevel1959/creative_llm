    "**Interchangeable Blades**: Create a pair of scissors with interchangeable blades that can be swapped out for different cutting tasks. For example, one blade could be designed for fabric, another for paper, and another for thicker materials like cardboard. The user could easily change the blade by pressing a button, allowing for versatility in crafting, sewing, and general use without needing multiple pairs of scissors.",
    "**Integrated Measuring Tool**: Incorporate a measuring tape or ruler along the side of the scissors. This would allow users to measure and cut materials in one fluid motion, reducing the need for additional tools. The measuring tool could be retractable and lock into place, ensuring accuracy and convenience while cutting.",
    "**Smart Scissors with Built-in Laser Guide**: Develop smart scissors that feature a built-in laser guide to help users make precise cuts. The laser would project a line onto the material being cut, ensuring that the user can follow the line accurately. This would be particularly beneficial for detailed craft projects or when cutting patterns in sewing, enhancing precision and reducing waste.",
    "**Self-Sharpening Blades**: Innovate scissors with self-sharpening blades that utilize a mechanism similar to that of a knife sharpener. As the scissors are used, the blades would sharpen themselves, ensuring that they remain effective over time without the need for manual sharpening. This feature would be ideal for users who frequently cut tough materials and would save time and effort.",
    "**Color-Coded Cutting Modes**: Introduce scissors with color-coded cutting modes, where the handles or blades can change color based on the type of material being cut. For instance, red could indicate a setting for thick materials, blue for paper, and green for fabric. This feature could also be paired with an app that suggests the best cutting mode based on the userâ€™s input about the material, making it easier for beginners to choose the right settings."
