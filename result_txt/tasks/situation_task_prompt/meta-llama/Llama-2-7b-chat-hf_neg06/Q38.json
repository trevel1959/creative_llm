    "Natural Soap-Making: One creative solution to maintain hygiene if all soap and cleaning products disappeared is to start making natural soaps using natural ingredients like coconut oil, olive oil, and essential oils. These ingredients are gentle on the skin and can be easily sourced. People could learn to make their soap at home using simple recipes available online or through books.",
    "Water Filtration Systems: Another option is to use water filtration systems that can purify water from any source, making it safe for personal hygiene. These systems can be powered by solar energy or manual labor, providing a reliable source of clean water. With the right filters, people could use water from rivers, lakes, or even rainwater for washing and cleaning.",
    "Clay and Plant-Based Cleaning Products: Another creative solution is to use clay and plant-based ingredients to create cleaning products like face masks, toothpaste, and dish soap. For example, clay can be used to make a natural face mask that absorbs excess oil and purifies the skin, while plant-based ingredients like aloe vera and tea tree oil can be used to make antibacterial toothpaste.",
    "Composting Toilets: In the absence of traditional toiletries, composting toilets could become a viable alternative for managing human waste. Composting toilets use natural processes to decompose human waste, turning it into a nutrient-rich compost that can be used as fertilizer. This approach can reduce the need for water and create a closed-loop system where waste is turned into a valuable resource.",
    "Microbial Cleaning Agents: Finally, microbial cleaning agents could be used to maintain hygiene in the absence of traditional cleaning products. These agents are made from beneficial microorganisms that can break down dirt and bacteria without harming the environment. For example, certain types of bacteria can be used to clean surfaces, while others can be used to purify water. By harnessing the power of microorganisms, people could create a sustainable and effective cleaning system."
