    "Natural Beauty: If all cosmetic products disappeared, we would have to rely on natural ingredients to maintain our personal grooming habits. We could use fruits, vegetables, and other natural products to cleanse our skin, style our hair, and even color our nails. For example, we could use lemon juice to cleanse our skin, honey to moisturize it, and cinnamon to color our hair.",
    "DIY Projects: We could start DIY projects to create our own cosmetics. We could make our own facial scrubs, lip balms, and even perfumes using essential oils and natural ingredients. This would give us more control over what we put into our products and allow us to create personalized grooming routines.",
    "Community Support: We could rely on our community to help us maintain our personal grooming habits. We could trade products and tips with friends and family, or even start a community garden to grow our own ingredients. This would not only help us maintain our grooming habits but also build stronger relationships with those around us.",
    "Upcycling: We could upcycle old products to create new ones. For example, we could use old toothbrushes to clean our teeth or old toothpaste containers to store our homemade toothpaste. This would not only help us maintain our grooming habits but also reduce waste.",
    "Technology: We could use technology to maintain our personal grooming habits. We could use apps to track our skincare routines, or even use virtual reality to try on makeup. This would allow us to maintain our grooming habits while still having access to the latest products and techniques."
