    "In a vibrant jungle, there lived a parrot named Pico who was unlike any other. While his feathered friends could mimic human speech flawlessly, Pico had a peculiar quirk—he could never repeat a single word. Instead, he spoke in colorful riddles and poetic verses, enchanting the animals around him. One day, a lost traveler stumbled into the jungle, frustrated by the silence of the wildlife. Pico approached him, sharing a riddle about finding one's path. Intrigued, the traveler pondered and soon discovered his way home. From that day on, Pico became the jungle’s wise storyteller, proving that sometimes, originality speaks louder than repetition.",
