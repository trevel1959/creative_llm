    "**Multi-Function Wine Opener**: Design a wine opener that incorporates additional functions such as a built-in aerator and pourer. After opening the bottle, users can easily aerate the wine as they pour, enhancing its flavor and aroma. This would be especially useful for wines that benefit from aeration, streamlining the process into one tool.",
    "**Ergonomic Design with Adaptive Grip**: Create a wine opener with an adjustable grip that conforms to the userâ€™s hand size and strength. The opener could feature soft-touch materials and customizable grips that can be changed based on the user's preference. This would make it easier for individuals with limited hand strength or dexterity to open wine bottles comfortably.",
    "**Rechargeable Electric Wine Opener with UV Sanitizer**: Develop an electric wine opener that not only opens bottles at the touch of a button but also includes a UV light feature to sanitize the bottle neck before pouring. This dual functionality would ensure that the wine is not only opened effortlessly but also served in a clean manner, appealing to health-conscious consumers.",
    "**Wine Opener with Built-in Temperature Sensor**: Incorporate a temperature sensor into the wine opener that can measure the temperature of the wine bottle. This feature would alert the user if the wine is at the optimal temperature for serving. An accompanying LED display could indicate the current temperature, ensuring that wine enthusiasts serve their wine at its best.",
    "**Personalized Wine Opener**: Offer customizable wine openers that allow users to engrave their names, initials, or a special date on the handle. This could be a great gift option for wine lovers and would add a personal touch to the wine-opening experience. Additionally, different color options and materials could be available to suit individual styles."
