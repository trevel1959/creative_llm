    "**Scent Layering Candles**: Design candles with multiple layers of wax, each infused with different scents that are released sequentially as the candle burns down. This could allow users to enjoy a journey of fragrances—starting with a fresh citrus top layer, transitioning to a floral middle, and finishing with a warm vanilla base. Users could choose candles based on the time of day or their mood, creating a personalized sensory experience.",
    "**Smart Candles with App Integration**: Develop candles that can connect to a smartphone app via Bluetooth. The app could allow users to control the candle’s burn time, scent intensity, and even set timers for when to light or extinguish the candle. Users could also access a library of curated playlists that sync with the candle’s light or scent, creating an immersive experience for events like dinner parties or relaxation sessions.",
    "**Eco-Friendly Refillable Candles**: Introduce a line of refillable candles made from sustainable materials. The outer shell could be a beautifully designed ceramic or glass container that can be reused indefinitely. Users would simply purchase refill packs of wax and wicks in various scents, minimizing waste and encouraging eco-conscious habits. This would also allow for customization of scents and colors based on personal preference.",
    "**Interactive Candle Holders**: Create candle holders that respond to the flicker of the flame. These holders could be designed with LED lights that mimic the candle’s flicker, creating a mesmerizing visual effect. Additionally, they could incorporate sound elements that play soft music or nature sounds, enhancing the overall atmosphere. This would make the experience of lighting a candle more dynamic and engaging.",
    "**Candle with Embedded Seeds**: Design candles that have embedded seeds in the wax. Once the candle has burned down, users can plant the leftover wax and seeds in the ground. As the wax melts, it nourishes the seeds, allowing flowers or herbs to grow from what was once a candle. This idea promotes sustainability and gives users a tangible way to connect with nature, transforming their candle experience into a gardening opportunity."
