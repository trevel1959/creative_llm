    "Shadow portraits: People might also turn to techniques like taking shadow portraits, where silhouettes representing oneself or others are created by the light source and captured on a surface.",

    "Alternate means of self-viewing: People might opt to view themselves in other ways, like through digital devices that use computer vision technology to identify features and create virtual representations of oneself."
