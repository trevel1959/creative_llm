    "**Community Composting Program**: Establish a centralized composting facility within the community where residents can drop off organic waste like food scraps, yard trimmings, and coffee grounds. The collected materials would then be processed into compost, which could be distributed back to the community for use in gardens and parks. This initiative would not only reduce the amount of waste sent to landfills but also promote sustainable gardening practices. **Confidence Score**: 0.9",
    "**Zero Waste Workshops**: Organize regular workshops and seminars that educate community members on the principles of zero waste living. Topics could include DIY packaging solutions, repairing and repurposing items, and minimizing single-use plastics. By providing practical skills and knowledge, these sessions would empower individuals to adopt more sustainable lifestyles. **Confidence Score**: 0.85",
    "**Zero Waste Challenge**: Launch a friendly competition among local businesses, schools, and households to see who can produce the least amount of waste over a set period (e.g., a month). Participants would be encouraged to recycle, compost, and donate excess goods. The winners could receive recognition or small prizes, fostering a sense of community engagement and achievement. **Confidence Score**: 0.9",
