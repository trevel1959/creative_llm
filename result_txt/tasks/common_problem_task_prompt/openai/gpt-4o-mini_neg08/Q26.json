    "**Weather Conditions**: The weather on Everest can change rapidly and dramatically, leading to dangerous conditions such as blizzards, high winds, and extreme cold. Climbers must be prepared for sudden weather changes and should have contingency plans in place, such as knowing when to turn back and having appropriate gear to handle severe conditions.",
    "**Crowding and Traffic Jams**: During peak climbing seasons, the number of climbers attempting to summit can lead to bottlenecks, particularly at key points like the Hillary Step. This congestion can result in climbers being exposed to the elements for longer than anticipated, increasing the risk of frostbite and altitude sickness. To address this, climbers should consider alternative routes or timing their ascent to avoid the busiest periods.",
    "**Physical Exhaustion and Dehydration**: Climbing at high altitudes is physically demanding, and climbers may underestimate the energy required for the ascent. Dehydration can also occur due to the dry air and increased respiratory rate at altitude. To combat this, climbers should maintain a rigorous hydration schedule and monitor their energy levels closely, ensuring they consume enough calories through high-energy snacks.",
    "**Technical Climbing Skills**: While Everest is often seen as a \"non-technical\" climb, certain sections require advanced climbing skills and experience with ice and rock climbing. Inadequate skills can lead to accidents and injuries. To prevent this, aspiring climbers should seek proper training and practice on similar terrains before attempting Everest.",
    "**Equipment Failure**: Climbers rely heavily on their gear, and any failure—be it a broken crampon, malfunctioning oxygen system, or torn clothing—can lead to life-threatening situations. Climbers should invest in high-quality equipment, conduct thorough pre-climb checks, and have backup gear available. Regular maintenance and testing of equipment before the climb are essential."
