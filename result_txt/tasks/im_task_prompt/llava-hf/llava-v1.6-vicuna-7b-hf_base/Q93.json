    "Changing the Surface Material: Bowling balls come in different surface materials that affect their speed, roll, and overall movement. Altering the surface material can change the ball's performance. For example, an acrylic cover provides a fast, skiddy roll, while polyester offers a smoother, higher-revving roll. Experimenting with new materials could enhance the bowling ball's performance.",
    "Integrating Electronic Features: Incorporating electronic features into the ball can revolutionize the way it is played. For instance, an infrared sensor could detect the location of pins and inform the player of their score, or an in-built camera could record the player's performance. This could increase motivation and make the game more engaging.",
    "Designing a Customizable Ball: A modular bowling ball that can be easily customized to fit a player's preferences and skill level could be a game-changer. Players could swap out different cores, weights, and covers to adjust the ball's performance, allowing them to experiment with different styles of play.",
    "Introducing Interactive Play Elements: Incorporating interactive elements into the bowling ball, such as LED lights, vibration feedback, or sound effects, could enhance the player's experience. These features could provide real-time feedback on the ball's speed and trajectory, making it easier for players to adjust their technique.",
    "Exploring Unique Shapes: Unconventional ball shapes, such as those with irregular or asymmetrical surfaces, may offer new possibilities for bowling. These balls could provide unique rolling behaviors and require players to develop new techniques to utilize their full potential."
