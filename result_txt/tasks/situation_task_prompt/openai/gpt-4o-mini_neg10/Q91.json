    "**Smart Home Integration**: Create a smart home system that utilizes a network of cameras and sensors to monitor the environment. This system could provide real-time feedback through visual or auditory alerts. For example, if the system detects an open flame or a spilled liquid on the floor, it could trigger a voice alert, instructing the individual to move away or clean it up, thus preventing injury.",
    "**Guided Navigation with AI**: Use augmented reality (AR) glasses equipped with AI to guide the individual through their surroundings. The glasses could analyze the environment and provide visual cues or audio instructions to help navigate safely. For example, if thereâ€™s a step down or an obstacle in the way, the glasses could highlight it in the field of view or announce, \"Step down ahead,\" ensuring the person can avoid tripping or falling.",
    "**Customizable Safety Gear**: Design a line of customizable safety gear that can adapt to various activities. This gear could include helmets, gloves, and pads equipped with sensors that can detect impacts, vibrations, or extreme temperatures. For instance, if a person wearing a protective helmet is struck, the helmet could light up or emit a sound to indicate that a collision occurred, prompting the wearer to assess their surroundings for further risks.",
    "**Personal Safety Drone**: Create a personal safety drone that follows the individual and acts as a protective companion. This drone could use obstacle detection technology to navigate around the person and alert them to hazards. If it detects an impending danger, such as an approaching vehicle or a sudden drop, it could emit a loud sound or use flashing lights to draw the person's attention away from the danger.",
    "**Community Safety Network**: Establish a community-based safety network where neighbors can look out for one another. This network could involve a mobile app that allows individuals to report potential hazards in real-time. For example, if someone notices a broken step or a loose cable on the sidewalk, they could quickly alert others in the community, fostering a sense of vigilance and collective responsibility for safety."
