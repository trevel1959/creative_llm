    "Sponge-Inspired Furniture: Design a line of furniture pieces that incorporate the properties of a sponge. For example, a sofa with built-in sponge cushions that can absorb and retain heat, or a desk with a sponge-textured surface that can help reduce noise and improve acoustics.",
    "Sponge-Based Water Filtration System: Develop a water filtration system that uses sponges as the primary filtration medium. The sponges would be able to absorb and remove impurities from water, making it safe for drinking and other uses.",
    "Sponge-Inspired Building Materials: Create new building materials that mimic the properties of a sponge. For example, a sponge-like insulation material that can absorb and retain heat, or a sponge-like concrete that can improve the structural integrity of buildings.",
    "Sponge-Based Art: Use sponges as a medium for creating art. Create sponge paintings, sculptures, or installations that explore the unique textures and patterns that can be created with this versatile material.",
    "Sponge-Inspired Sports Equipment: Design sports equipment that incorporates the properties of a sponge. For example, a sponge-covered baseball that can absorb and dissipate impact, or a sponge-padded helmet that can absorb and distribute impact."
