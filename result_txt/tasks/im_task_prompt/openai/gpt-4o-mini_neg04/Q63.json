    "Smart Roller Skates**: Integrate a Bluetooth-enabled device into the roller skates that connects to a smartphone app. The app can track speed, distance, and calories burned, while also offering tutorials for beginners. Additionally, it could include a safety feature that alerts emergency contacts if the skater has a fall or accident, using GPS to share their location."
