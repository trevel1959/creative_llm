    "**Solar Window Panes**: Develop a revolutionary new window technology that harnesses solar energy during the day and stores it in a built-in battery. At night, the windows can release this stored energy to produce a soft, ambient glow, lighting up the room without the need for external lamps or fixtures.",
    "**Bioluminescent Wall Decals**: Design and create bioluminescent wall decals that can absorb and store energy during the day. At night, these decals emit a gentle, soft light, providing a warm and cozy ambiance to the room. This innovative solution would eliminate the need for traditional lighting fixtures.",
    "**Smart Fiber Optic Cables**: Engineer a new type of fiber optic cable that can be woven into the fabric of furniture, walls, or even clothing. These cables can absorb and transmit light energy, allowing for a network of subtle, ambient lighting throughout the room.",
    "**Nano-Particle Lighting**: Develop a technology that utilizes nanoparticles to absorb and emit light. These nanoparticles can be embedded in various materials, such as paint, wallpaper, or even fabrics, creating a room-wide, soft glow. This innovative solution would eliminate the need for traditional lighting fixtures.",
    "**Electro-Active Polymers**: Design and develop a new type of electro-active polymer (EAP) that can be molded into various shapes and forms. When an electric current is applied, these EAPs can change their shape and emit light, creating a dynamic, interactive lighting system that can be integrated into furniture, walls, or other room elements."
