    "Metal House: If all natural materials like wood and stone disappeared, we could build a house using only metal. This could be done by constructing a steel or aluminum frame, and then filling it with insulation made of recycled materials like cardboard or plastic bottles. The roof could be made of metal sheets or corrugated steel, and the walls could be finished with metal panels or painted to give the house a modern look.",
    "Earthbag House: Another option would be to build an earthbag house, which uses large bags filled with soil or sand to create the walls. The bags are stacked on top of each other and then secured with ropes or straps. This type of house is eco-friendly, energy-efficient, and can be built quickly and inexpensively.",
    "Recycled Plastic House: We could also build a house using recycled plastic. This could be done by using plastic lumber, which is made from recycled plastic bottles, to construct the frame. The walls could be made of recycled plastic panels, and the roof could be made of recycled plastic shingles. This type of house is durable, low-maintenance, and can be built quickly and inexpensively.",
    "Straw Bale House: We could also build a straw bale house, which uses large bales of straw to create the walls. The bales are stacked on top of each other and then secured with ropes or straps. This type of house is eco-friendly, energy-efficient, and can be built quickly and inexpensively.",
    "Glass House: Finally, we could build a glass house, which uses large sheets of glass to create the walls. This type of house is modern, sleek, and allows for plenty of natural light. The roof could be made of glass or metal, and the walls could be finished with glass panels or painted to give the house a unique look."
