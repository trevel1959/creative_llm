    "Build a Solar-Powered Dome: Create a large, translucent dome that can collect and focus sunlight, even when the sky is cloudy. The dome could be made of a specialized material that allows sunlight to pass through, while keeping the rain and clouds out. This way, the collected sunlight could be channeled into homes, buildings, or even entire cities, providing a reliable source of natural light.",
    "Cloud-Busting Drone Fleet: Develop a fleet of drones equipped with specialized technology that can break up and disperse clouds. These drones could be deployed in areas where cloud cover is a significant issue, and they could use advanced sensors and algorithms to identify the best locations to target. By breaking up clouds, more sunlight could reach the ground, providing a solution to the cloud cover problem.",
    "Sunlight-Harvesting Fabric: Create a new type of fabric that can absorb and store sunlight during the day, then release it at night. This fabric could be used for clothing, tents, or even entire buildings. By harnessing the sun's energy in this way, people could have access to natural light even when the sky is cloudy.",
    "Cloud-Based Energy Storage: Develop a system that uses clouds as a medium for storing energy. This could involve creating a network of specialized clouds that can store excess energy generated from renewable sources, such as wind or solar power. When the sun is shining or the wind is blowing, the excess energy could be stored in the clouds, and then released when needed, providing a reliable source of energy even when the sky is cloudy.",
    "Cloud-Avoiding Technology: Create a technology that can detect and avoid clouds, allowing buildings or vehicles to move to areas where the sky is clear. This could involve using advanced sensors and algorithms to detect cloud formations and adjust the path of a building or vehicle accordingly. By avoiding clouds, people could still enjoy natural light and warmth, even when the sky is cloudy."
