    "**Smart Integration**: Integrate the washing machine with smart home technology, allowing it to be controlled remotely through a smartphone app. This would enable users to start, stop, or monitor the cycle from anywhere in the house.",
    "**Customizable Programs**: Offer customizable programs that cater to different fabric types and care labels. Users could select from pre-programmed options for different types of laundry or even create their own programs for specific fabrics or care requirements.",
    "**Automatic Sorting**: Implement an automatic sorting system that separates and sorts laundry based on fabric type, care labels, and color. This would save users time and effort in pre-sorting their laundry.",
    "**Integrated Drying System**: Incorporate an integrated drying system that uses heated air or microwave technology to dry clothes after the washing cycle. This would eliminate the need for a separate dryer and reduce energy consumption.",
    "**Wastewater Recycling**: Design the washing machine to recycle the wastewater produced during the cleaning process. This could be achieved through a built-in filtration system that purifies the water and returns it to the washing machine for reuse."
