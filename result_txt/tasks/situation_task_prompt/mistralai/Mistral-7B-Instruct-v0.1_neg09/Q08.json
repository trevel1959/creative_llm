    "Desalination: Another option would be to desalinate seawater to obtain clean drinking water. This process involves removing salt and other minerals from seawater through a series of filtration and distillation processes.",
    "Rainwater harvesting: Collecting rainwater from rooftops, surfaces, or ground catchments can also provide clean drinking water. This method involves filtering and purifying the collected water to remove any contaminants or impurities.",
    "Water filtration systems: Installing water filtration systems in homes and businesses can also provide clean drinking water. These systems use activated carbon, ceramic, or other materials to remove contaminants and impurities from tap water.",
    "Water conservation: Conserving water by reducing usage and waste can also help ensure that there is enough clean drinking water available. This can involve fixing leaks, taking shorter showers, and using water-efficient appliances.",
    "Water reuse: Reusing water from sources such as greywater (wastewater from sinks, showers, and washing machines) or treated wastewater can also provide clean drinking water. This process involves treating the water to remove contaminants and impurities and then using it for non-potable purposes such as irrigation or flushing toilets."
