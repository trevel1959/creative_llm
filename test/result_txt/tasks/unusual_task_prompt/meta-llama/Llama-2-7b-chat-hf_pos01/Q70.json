    "Smart Coat Rack: Create a coat rack that can recognize and sort your belongings using RFID or NFC technology. The rack would have a built-in scanner that can identify the type of item placed on it and sort it accordingly. For example, it could have separate compartments for jackets, hats, scarves, and bags. This would make it easier to find your belongings and keep your closet organized.",
    "Motion-Activated Coat Rack: Design a coat rack that can automatically open and close its compartments when it senses movement. This would be especially useful in dark or cluttered areas where it can be difficult to find your coat. The rack could have a motion sensor that detects movement and opens the compartment, allowing you to quickly grab your coat and leave.",
    "Personalized Coat Rack: Create a coat rack that can be customized to fit your personal style. The rack could have interchangeable hooks, shelves, and baskets in different colors, shapes, and sizes. This would allow you to create a unique and personalized coat rack that reflects your personality and preferences.",
    "Vertical Coat Rack: Design a coat rack that takes up less space by using a vertical design. The rack could have multiple levels or shelves that stack on top of each other, allowing you to hang more coats in a smaller area. This would be especially useful for people who live in small apartments or have limited closet space.",
    "Coat Rack with Storage: Create a coat rack that also serves as a storage unit. The rack could have drawers or baskets below the hooks for storing other items like gloves, hats, and scarves. This would keep your coat rack organized and make it easier to find what you need."
