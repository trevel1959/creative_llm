    "Turtle-Powered Wind Turbines: Design a wind turbine that uses turtles as the primary power source. The turbine could be shaped like a giant turtle shell and have the turtles inside the shell move their flippers to generate electricity. The turbine could be placed in areas with strong winds, such as coastal areas or mountain tops, and could provide a sustainable source of renewable energy.",
    "Flying Turtle Race Car: Imagine a race car that is powered by a flying turtle. The car could be designed to look like a turtle shell, with the turtle inside the shell providing the power to propel the car forward. The race car could participate in races around the world, with the turtle's speed and agility giving it an advantage over traditional gas-powered"
