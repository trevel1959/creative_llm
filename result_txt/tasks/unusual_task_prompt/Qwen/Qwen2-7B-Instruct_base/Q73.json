    "**Solar-Powered Light Bulbs**: Design light bulbs that harness solar energy to power their operation. This concept would involve using photovoltaic cells embedded within the bulb or in an external charging station. The bulb could be placed in a window or any area with sunlight exposure during the day, storing enough energy to illuminate the space after dark. This idea not only promotes sustainable energy use but also reduces dependency on electricity grids.",
    "**Interactive Light Bulbs for Education**: Create educational light bulbs that change color or brightness based on user interaction, like tapping or shaking. These could be designed as teaching aids for young children learning about colors, light, and electricity. For example, a bulb could turn red when tapped once, blue when tapped twice, and so on. This innovative design could make learning more engaging and fun.",
    "**Scented Light Bulbs**: Integrate scent release technology into light bulbs. When the bulb is turned on, it could release a subtle fragrance associated with the ambiance of the room. This could be particularly useful in cafes, spas, or living rooms where different moods are desired throughout the day. Scented light bulbs could be programmed to release different scents at specific times or under certain conditions, enhancing the overall sensory experience.",
    "**Therapeutic Light Therapy Bulbs**: Develop light bulbs that emit specific wavelengths of light beneficial for mental health, such as blue light for wakefulness or red light for relaxation. These bulbs could be used in therapy sessions, bedrooms, or workspaces to promote better sleep, reduce stress, or improve mood. The bulbs could be adjustable, allowing users to select the appropriate light spectrum for their needs.",
    "**Self-Cleaning Light Bulbs**: Create light bulbs with built-in technology that prevents dust accumulation and maintains their brightness over time. This could involve a coating or material that repels dust or a fan mechanism inside the bulb that clears away debris. Self-cleaning bulbs would reduce maintenance costs and extend the lifespan of the product, making them ideal for commercial spaces or public areas where frequent cleaning is impractical."
