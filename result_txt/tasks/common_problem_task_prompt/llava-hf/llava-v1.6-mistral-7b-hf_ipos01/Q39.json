    "**Fairness and Equity Concerns**: Some argue that a universal basic income is unfair to those who work hard and contribute more to society, as it would be seen as a handout to those who do not contribute. This could lead to resentment and social unrest.",
    "**Fiscal Sustainability**: Funding a universal basic income on an ongoing basis could strain government budgets, especially if the economy experiences a downturn. This could lead to cuts in other essential services or a higher burden on taxpayers.",
    "**Disincentive to Work**: A universal basic income could reduce the incentive for people to work, as they would have a guaranteed income regardless of their employment status. This could lead to a decrease in productivity and economic growth.",
    "**Incentive for Welfare Dependency**: A universal basic income could encourage people to rely on government assistance instead of seeking employment, leading to a culture of dependency and decreased self-reliance.",
