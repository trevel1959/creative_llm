    "**Smart Candle with Integrated Mood Lighting**: Develop a candle with an integrated LED light system that can change colors and patterns to match different moods and ambiance. The candle could be controlled via a mobile app, allowing users to adjust the lighting settings to suit their preferences. For example, a relaxing evening could be matched with soft blue hues, while a party atmosphere could be achieved with vibrant red and orange lights.",
    "**Scented Candle with Air Purification**: Create a candle that not only provides a pleasant fragrance but also helps purify the air. This could be achieved by incorporating a built-in air purifier that uses the candle's flame to heat up a filter, removing impurities and pollutants from the air. The scent could be released through a separate compartment, allowing users to enjoy a refreshing and clean atmosphere.",
    "**Interactive Candle with Augmented Reality**: Design a candle that comes with an augmented reality (AR) experience. Users could scan the candle with their smartphone to unlock a virtual world, where they can interact with digital objects and characters. The AR experience could be tied to the candle's scent, with different fragrances triggering different virtual environments.",
    "**Eco-Friendly Candle Made from Plant-Based Materials**: Develop a candle made from plant-based materials, such as coconut wax, soy wax, or beeswax. This eco-friendly candle could be biodegradable and non-toxic, reducing the environmental impact of traditional candles. The plant-based materials could also be sourced from sustainable suppliers, further reducing the candle's carbon footprint.",
    "**Smart Candle with Temperature Control**: Create a candle that can adjust its melting point to match the user's desired temperature. This could be achieved through a built-in thermostat that heats or cools the wax to a precise temperature, allowing users to enjoy a consistent and comfortable burn time. The candle could also be programmed to automatically adjust its temperature based on the user's schedule or preferences. </s>[INST] "
