    "**Tree Migration Patterns**: Trees that can walk could migrate to areas with optimal growing conditions, leading to a shift in global ecosystems. They might move towards regions with abundant water, nutrient-rich soil, and favorable temperatures. This could result in the displacement of other plant species, altering the composition of forests and potentially leading to new, unforeseen relationships between trees and their environments. Confidence: 0.8",
    "**Urban Tree Architecture**: Trees with mobility could adapt to urban environments, transforming cityscapes with their unique, dynamic architecture. They might grow in unexpected places, such as rooftops, alleys, or abandoned buildings, providing shade, improving air quality, and creating new public spaces. This could lead to innovative urban planning and a reevaluation of the role of trees in urban ecosystems. Confidence: 0.7",
    "**Tree Communication Networks**: Trees that can walk could establish complex communication networks, enabling them to share information about their surroundings, including weather patterns, soil conditions, and potential threats. This could lead to the development of a collective, tree-based intelligence, allowing them to coordinate their actions and respond to environmental challenges in a more coordinated manner. Confidence: 0.9",
    "**Ecological Engineering**: Trees with mobility could engage in ecological engineering, actively modifying their environments to create new habitats for other species. They might build complex networks of branches, roots, and canopies, providing shelter, food, and resources for a diverse range of organisms. This could lead to the creation of novel ecosystems, with trees playing a central role in shaping their surroundings. Confidence: 0.8",
    "**Mythological Significance**: Trees that can walk could become imbued with mythological significance, taking on symbolic roles in human cultures. They might be revered as sacred beings, embodying the wisdom, strength, and resilience of nature. This could lead to the development of new mythologies, folklore, and cultural practices centered around the enigmatic, walking trees. Confidence: 0.6"
