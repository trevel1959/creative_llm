    "**Augmented Reality (AR) Overlay**: Develop an AR application that pairs with the guitar assistant, allowing users to see chord diagrams, tablature, and finger placements projected onto their guitar or in their field of vision through smart glasses or mobile devices. This would help beginners visualize where to place their fingers while playing and provide interactive tutorials that can enhance their learning experience.",
    "**Built-in Tuner and Metronome**: Integrate a high-precision tuner and customizable metronome directly into the guitar assistant. The tuner could automatically adjust to different tunings and provide visual or audio feedback. The metronome could feature various rhythms and time signatures, allowing players to practice in different styles, with the option to set up play-along tracks for a more immersive experience.",
    "**Collaborative Jamming Feature**: Introduce a feature that connects users with other guitarists around the world for virtual jam sessions. The assistant could sync their devices to ensure that everyone plays in time, regardless of their location. This could also include a library of backing tracks in various genres, allowing users to practice improvisation and collaboration skills with real-time feedback.",
    "**Maintenance and Care Reminders**: Incorporate a maintenance tracking system that reminds users when to change strings, adjust the neck, or perform other upkeep tasks. The assistant could provide step-by-step video tutorials on how to perform these tasks and even connect with local luthiers for repairs or setups, ensuring the instrument remains in optimal condition.",
    "**Song Composition Assistant**: Develop a songwriting tool that helps users compose original music. This could include chord progression generators, lyric suggestions based on themes or emotions, and even an AI that analyzes existing songs to provide inspiration. Users could record their ideas directly into the assistant, which would then help them structure their compositions and offer tips on arrangement."
