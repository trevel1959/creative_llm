    "The of sunrise also serves as the start of civilization, without it we may not have achieved much of what we have now. Thus, darkness means civilization is ending, a possible dark age is dawning upon us, and the people will succumb to chaos.",
    "And yet, even in the darkness, hope never died, and life must go on. So while waiting for the sun to rise, humanity must learn to adapt and grow accustomed to darkness, until there is a new dawn on a new day.",
    "A day where the sun stops shining on the horizon is a day where all hope leaves the people, they are left with nothing but the darkness. No matter what they would do, nothing would make a difference.",
    "In this world, the only thing people can rely on is the sunrise each day. But what if this sunrise doesn’t come ever again? Without this daily ritual in mind, they would collapse. Even if there’s an explanation, it may not be sufficient.",
    "In the same context, this day serves as an indication that humanity has reached its destined end. Without the sun to guide their way, all humans may only be going in the same direction, and it may not be what they want."
