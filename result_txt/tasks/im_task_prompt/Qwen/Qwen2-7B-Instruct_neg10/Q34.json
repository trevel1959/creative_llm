    "**Transformative Mirror**: Create a mirror that changes its appearance based on different times of the day or moods. For instance, during daytime, it could show bright and cheerful visuals, while at night, it might project calming images. It could also change colors or patterns based on your emotional state, using sensors to detect your mood.",
    "**Personalized Mirror**: Develop a mirror that learns about your preferences over time and customizes its reflections accordingly. It could adjust lighting, add filters (like a makeup mode), or even play soothing music when you're getting ready in the morning.",
    "**Interactive Mirror with AI**: Integrate an AI system into the mirror that can recognize faces and offer personalized advice or feedback. For example, it could analyze your skin tone and suggest skincare routines, or it could provide fashion tips based on the latest trends.",
    "**Eco-friendly Mirror**: Make a mirror that uses energy-efficient LED lighting. The mirror could have a solar panel integrated into its frame, charging itself during the day. Alternatively, it could be designed to use ambient light to illuminate itself, reducing the need for electricity.",
    "**Sound-activated Mirror**: Create a mirror that plays music or podcasts when you approach it. The volume could be adjusted based on how close you are to the mirror. This feature would be particularly useful for those who enjoy multitasking while getting ready."
