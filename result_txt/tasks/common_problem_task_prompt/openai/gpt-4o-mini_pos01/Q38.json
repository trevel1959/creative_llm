    "**Budget Overruns**: Blockbuster movies often have substantial budgets, but unexpected expenses can arise, such as special effects costs, location permits, or last-minute script changes. If the budget exceeds initial estimates, it can lead to pressure from producers and stakeholders, potentially compromising the film's quality or the director's creative vision.",
    "**Creative Differences**: Directors may have a specific vision for the film, but producers, screenwriters, or even actors might have differing opinions on how the story should unfold. These creative differences can lead to tension on set, hinder collaboration, and ultimately impact the film's overall coherence and success.",
    "**Technical Challenges**: Filming a blockbuster often involves advanced technology, such as CGI, drones, or elaborate stunts. Technical failures can occur, whether due to equipment malfunctions or unforeseen challenges during filming. This could lead to delays in the shooting schedule and increased costs as the team scrambles to resolve the issues.",
    "**Public Relations and Marketing Missteps**: The success of a blockbuster is not just about the film itself; it's also about how it is marketed. Missteps in PR, such as inappropriate comments from cast members, controversies, or poor promotional strategies, can alienate potential audiences and negatively affect box office performance.",
    "**Location Issues**: Filming on location can provide authenticity, but it can also lead to logistical nightmares. Issues such as weather conditions, local regulations, or unexpected closures can disrupt the shooting schedule. Additionally, if the location is far from the main production hub, it can create logistical challenges in transporting crew and equipment."
