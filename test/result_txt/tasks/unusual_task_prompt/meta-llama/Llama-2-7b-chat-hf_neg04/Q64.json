    "Thermos with a built-in cooling system: Create a thermos with a built-in cooling system that can keep drinks cold for a longer period. This can be achieved by incorporating a small refrigeration unit or a phase-change material that can absorb and release heat. This would ensure that the drink inside the thermos remains at a consistent temperature, regardless of the outside temperature.",
    "Smart Thermos with a Bluetooth Connectivity: Design a thermos that can connect to a user's smartphone via Bluetooth. This would allow the user to track the temperature of their drink, receive notifications when the temperature deviates from the desired range, and even control the temperature remotely. This would be particularly useful for people who are always on the go and need to keep their drinks at a specific temperature.",
    "Thermos with a built-in water filtration system: Create a thermos with a built-in water filtration system that can remove impurities and contaminants from the water. This would provide users with clean and safe drinking water, even when they are on the go. The filtration system could be made up of a series of tiny filters that can remove impurities as small as 0.2 microns.",
    "Thermos with a self-healing capability: Design a thermos that can repair itself in case of damage. This could be achieved by incorporating a special type of plastic that can heal cracks and breaks on its own. This would ensure that the thermos remains functional even after it has been dropped or damaged.",
    "Thermos with a built-in speaker: Create a thermos with a built-in speaker that can play music or other audio content. This would provide users with a convenient way to listen to their favorite tunes while on the go. The speaker could be powered by a small battery that can be recharged via a USB port. This would be particularly useful for people who enjoy listening to music while they exercise or work."
