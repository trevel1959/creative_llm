    "**Reflective Safety Leash**: Create a dog leash that is covered with highly reflective materials, making it visible in low-light conditions.

The leash comes in various colors and patterns, allowing pet owners to choose styles that match their personal tastes or their dog's personality.",
    "**Bungee Dog Leash with Adjustable Tension Control**: A bungee leash with a dial control mechanism that adjusts the tension based on how much pull your dog exerts.

The bungee material also absorbs shock and reduces strain on both the dog and the handler.",
    "**Biodegradable Dog Leash**: Craft a dog leash made entirely from eco-friendly materials, such as recycled plastics or plant-based fibers.

Additionally, consider packaging the leash with tips on reducing waste during pet ownership, encouraging responsible pet care."
