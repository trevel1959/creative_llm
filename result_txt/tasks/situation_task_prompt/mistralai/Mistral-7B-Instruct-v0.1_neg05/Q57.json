    "Build a floating city: If the ocean levels rise drastically, we can build a floating city that can withstand the water. The city can be made of lightweight materials that are resistant to water and can be built on a large platform. The city can have its own energy source and can be designed to be self-sufficient.",
    "Build an underwater city: Another option would be to build an underwater city. The city can be designed to be sustainable and can be built using materials that are resistant to water. The city can have its own energy source and can be designed to be self-sufficient.",
    "Build a platform city: A platform city can be built on top of the ocean. The city can be designed to be lightweight and can be built using materials that are resistant to water. The city can have its own energy source and can be designed to be self-sufficient.",
    "Build a floating island: A floating island can be built in the middle of the ocean. The island can be designed to be self-sufficient and can have its own energy source. The island can be built using materials that are resistant to water.",
    "Build a dome city: A dome city can be built on top of the ocean. The dome can be designed to be lightweight and can be built using materials that are resistant to water. The city can have its own energy source and can be designed to be self-sufficient."
