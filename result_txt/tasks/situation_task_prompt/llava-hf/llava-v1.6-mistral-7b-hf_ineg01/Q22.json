    "Develop a public transportation system: In the absence of roads, a comprehensive public transportation system would be essential. This could include buses, trams, or trains that are specifically designed to navigate the urban landscape without the need for road infrastructure. These vehicles could be powered by electricity, reducing air pollution and noise pollution in the city.",
    "Implement a pedestrian-friendly environment: A pedestrian-friendly environment could be created by widening sidewalks, adding pedestrian crossings, and incorporating more green spaces such as parks and tree-lined walkways. This would encourage walking as a primary mode of transportation and promote a healthier lifestyle.",
    "Utilize waterways: If the town or city has any waterways such as rivers, canals, or lakes, these could be utilized for transportation. Waterways can be used to create water taxis or water buses that can transport passengers across the city.",
    "Create underground tunnels: Underground tunnels could be constructed to allow vehicles to move beneath the surface of the city. These tunnels could be used for cars, bicycles, and even pedestrians, providing a reliable and safe transportation option.",
    "Establish a network of drones: In a futuristic scenario, a network of drones could be used to transport people and goods across the city. These drones could be controlled by a centralized system, ensuring efficient and safe transportation."
