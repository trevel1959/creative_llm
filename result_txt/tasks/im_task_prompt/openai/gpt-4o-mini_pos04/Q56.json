    "**Multifunctional Bell with LED Lights**: Combine a bicycle bell with an LED light system. When the bell is pressed, it not only rings but also activates a series of bright LED lights that flash in patterns. This could enhance visibility during night rides, ensuring that cyclists are seen by others while also alerting them with the sound of the bell.",
    "**Eco-Friendly Solar-Powered Bell**: Design a bicycle bell that is powered by a small solar panel. This bell would not only function as a sound alert but could also charge a small battery that powers additional features like LED lights or a GPS tracker. This eco-friendly option would appeal to environmentally conscious cyclists.",
    "**Personalized Sound Module**: Create a bell that allows users to upload their own sounds or choose from a library of pre-recorded sounds. For instance, riders could opt for a classic bike bell sound, a quirky animal noise, or even a short musical jingle. This would make each bike unique and add a personal touch to the cycling experience.",
    "**Vibration Alert System**: Develop a bell that includes a vibration alert feature for cyclists who may have hearing impairments or prefer not to use sound. The bell could be attached to the handlebars and vibrate when activated, ensuring that the rider is alerted to obstacles or other cyclists without relying solely on auditory signals.",
    "**Interactive Safety Bell**: Introduce a bell that can connect to other smart bike accessories, like a helmet or lights. When the bell is rung, it could trigger an alert to those accessories, such as flashing the lights or sending a notification to the rider's helmet display. This would create a comprehensive safety system that enhances communication between the rider and their surroundings."
