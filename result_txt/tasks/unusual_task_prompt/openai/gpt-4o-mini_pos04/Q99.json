    "**Picture Frame Hanger**: Instead of traditional hooks or nails, use a hair clip to hang lightweight picture frames. Attach the clip to the back of the frame and then hang it on a wall-mounted hook or a nail. This method allows for easy rearrangement of your artwork.",
    "**Zipper Pull**: If a zipper on your jacket or bag breaks, a hair clip can serve as a temporary zipper pull. Simply attach the clip to the zipper slider, giving you a functional way to open and close the zipper until you can get it repaired."
