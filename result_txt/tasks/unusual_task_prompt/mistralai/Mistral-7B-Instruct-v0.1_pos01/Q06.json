This could be integrated into a smartphone app or dashboard, and could also provide recommendations for the best types of tires based on driving habits and vehicle type.",
    "Develop a tire that is made from sustainable materials, such as recycled rubber or natural fibers, to reduce the environmental impact of tire production and disposal.",
    "Create a tire that is designed to be easily recycled, making it easier for consumers to dispose of their old tires in an environmentally friendly way.",
    "Develop a tire that is designed to be more energy-efficient, by reducing rolling resistance and improving traction. This could help to improve fuel efficiency and reduce emissions from vehicles.",
    "Create a tire that is designed to be more durable and long-lasting, by using advanced materials and manufacturing techniques. This could help to reduce the frequency of tire replacements and lower the overall cost of tire ownership."
