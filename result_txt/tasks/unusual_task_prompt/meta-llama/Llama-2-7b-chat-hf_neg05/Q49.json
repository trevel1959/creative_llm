    "Illuminated Frame: Create a picture frame that doubles as a light source. The frame could have a hidden LED strip or a small solar panel that powers a soft, warm glow. This would add a touch of magic to any room, making the picture inside come alive.",
    "Interactive Frame: Design a frame that allows users to interact with the picture inside. For example, the frame could have a touch-sensitive screen that allows users to swipe through images, or a voice-activated feature that lets them hear stories or memories associated with the picture.",
    "Smart Frame: Create a frame that can connect to the internet and display information about the picture or the person in the picture. For example, a frame with a built-in camera could take a photo of the person in the picture and display their social media profile or a map of where the photo was taken.",
    "Personalized Frame: Develop a frame that allows users to personalize the frame to match their personal style. Users could choose from different colors, fonts, or designs to create a one-of-a-kind frame that reflects their personality.",
    "Time-Lapse Frame: Create a frame that takes a time-lapse photo every hour, day, or month, and displays the sequence of photos inside the frame. This would create a unique and dynamic display that shows the passage of time in a visually striking way."
