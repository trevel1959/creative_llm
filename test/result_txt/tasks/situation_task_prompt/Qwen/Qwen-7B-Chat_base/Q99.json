    "Use texture: While colors may be lost, textures can still provide a unique way to differentiate between different objects. For example, rougher surfaces will feel different than smoother ones, or certain materials like wood or metal may have distinct patterns that can be felt.",
    "Sound: Another way to differentiate between objects is through sound. Different objects will make different sounds when they are touched or moved, even if they appear identical in color.",
    "Smell: Some objects may have distinct smells that can help distinguish them from others. For example, flowers may have a sweet scent, while grass may smell fresh and earthy.",
    "Taste: If all colors disappeared and food became grayscale, taste could become an important factor in distinguishing different foods. Different flavors may be more pronounced or easier to detect in a monochromatic environment.",
    "Use of shadows: Shadows can be used to create visual cues and differentiate between objects. For example, if two objects are placed side by side, one may cast a longer shadow than the other, allowing for easy differentiation."
