    "**Eco-Friendly Invitations**: Traditional paper invitations can contribute significantly to deforestation and waste. An alternative solution would be to use digital invitations, which save trees and reduce carbon emissions from printing and shipping. Alternatively, one could opt for invitations made from recycled paper or biodegradable materials, such as bamboo or hemp, which are more sustainable options.",
    "**Local and Seasonal Food Sourcing**: Sourcing food from local farmers ensures a reduced carbon footprint due to shorter transportation distances. However, this may also limit the variety of dishes available if the wedding date doesn't coincide with peak seasons for certain produce. To tackle this, the couple could plan the wedding during the best season for local ingredients or creatively incorporate a mix of seasonal and non-seasonal items, focusing on flavor combinations rather than strict adherence to seasonality.",
    "**Reducing Waste in Decorations**: Traditional wedding decorations often involve single-use items like balloons, floral arrangements, and disposable tableware, leading to significant waste. To mitigate this, the couple could choose biodegradable or reusable decorations, such as natural elements like wood, stone, or driftwood, or incorporate upcycled materials into their decor. Additionally, they could avoid disposable items by opting for reusable linens, glassware, and cutlery.",
    "**Sustainable Transportation**: Encouraging guests to use public transportation, carpool, or ride-sharing services can significantly reduce the carbon footprint associated with attending the wedding. The couple could offer incentives like discounted tickets for public transportation, provide shuttle services from major hubs, or arrange a carpool system. They could also consider hosting the event in a location easily accessible by public transport to further promote eco-friendly choices.",
    "**Eco-Friendly Accommodations**: If guests need overnight accommodations, the couple could encourage them to stay at eco-friendly hotels or resorts that prioritize sustainability through practices like energy-efficient lighting, water conservation, and waste reduction initiatives. They could provide information on nearby green accommodations or offer a list of options that meet specific environmental criteria."
