    "**Atmospheric Water Harvesting**: Develop a network of towering, vertically-stacked mesh structures that capture water vapor from the air. These structures would be treated with a proprietary coating that attracts and condenses water droplets, allowing for efficient collection and storage. The water would then be channeled into a centralized system for distribution.",
    "**Cloud-Seeding Drone Swarms**: Deploy swarms of drones equipped with cloud-seeding technology to enhance precipitation in areas with low rainfall. The drones would release substances like silver iodide or dry ice into clouds, stimulating the formation of larger droplets and increasing the likelihood of precipitation. This would allow for targeted water collection in areas of need.",
    "**Water-Condensing Solar Windows**: Develop and install solar windows that not only generate electricity but also condense water vapor from the air. These windows would be coated with a specialized material that attracts and traps water droplets, which would then be collected and stored for use. This technology could be integrated into buildings, homes, and even entire cities.",
    "**Fog Collection Nets**: Design and deploy large, mesh-like nets that capture fog droplets in areas with frequent fog. The nets would be suspended between trees or buildings, allowing the fog to pass through and condense onto the mesh. The collected water would then be channeled into a collection system for distribution.",
    "**Atmospheric Water Generators**: Develop compact, household-scale devices that harness the humidity in the air to produce clean drinking water. These devices would use advanced technologies like nanomaterials, heat exchangers, and membrane filtration to extract water from the air, making it possible for individuals to collect water without relying on traditional sources.
