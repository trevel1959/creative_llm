    "**Logistical Challenges in Coordination**: Organizing events across multiple time zones can complicate scheduling, resource allocation, and communication. There could be issues with inconsistent messaging or misalignment in campaign goals among various regional teams. To mitigate this, a centralized project management tool could be implemented, allowing for real-time updates, shared resources, and clear communication channels to ensure all teams are aligned.",
    "**Varied Regulations and Legal Compliance**: Fundraising laws and regulations differ significantly by country. Some regions may have strict guidelines regarding fundraising activities, requiring specific licenses or permits. This can lead to delays or legal challenges if not properly addressed. To avoid this, a legal advisory team with expertise in international fundraising laws should be established to guide compliance in each targeted region.",
    "**Digital Divide and Accessibility Issues**: Not all regions have equal access to technology or the internet, which can hinder participation in an online campaign. This digital divide could limit the campaign's reach and effectiveness. To combat this, the campaign could incorporate offline strategies, such as community events or local partnerships, ensuring inclusivity for those without reliable internet access.",
    "**Engagement Fatigue**: In a world saturated with fundraising campaigns, potential donors may experience fatigue and become desensitized to pleas for support. This could result in lower engagement and contributions. To counteract this, the campaign could utilize storytelling techniques, highlighting personal stories of cancer survivors and researchers, creating emotional connections that motivate people to contribute.",
    "**Transparency and Trust Issues**: Donors are increasingly concerned about where their money goes and how it will be used. A lack of transparency can lead to distrust and reduced contributions. To foster trust, the campaign should commit to regular updates on funding allocation, project progress, and success stories. Incorporating third-party audits and endorsements from reputable organizations can also enhance credibility."
