    "Community composting program: Create a composting program that encourages residents to separate their organic waste from their regular trash. This can be done through workshops, educational materials, and easy-to-use compost bins provided by the community. The compost can then be used to fertilize local gardens or sold to local farmers as a source of revenue.",
    "Zero-waste grocery store: Partner with local farmers and producers to create a zero-waste grocery store where all products are packaged in reusable containers or bulk bins. Customers can bring their own bags or containers to fill up with produce, bread, etc.",
    "Clothing swap event: Host a clothing swap event where residents can exchange gently used clothing items instead of buying new ones. This not only reduces waste but also creates a sense of community and connection among residents.",
    "Recycling education campaign: Launch an education campaign that teaches residents about the importance of recycling and how to properly sort their waste. This can include workshops, online resources, and interactive games to make learning fun and engaging.",

This could include live music, food vendors, and workshops on topics such as composting, upcycling, and reducing plastic use. By hosting this event, the community can come together to celebrate sustainability and inspire others to join the zero waste movement."
