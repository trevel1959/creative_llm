    "**Self-Cleaning Umbrella**: Utilizing advanced nanotechnology, this umbrella would be coated with a special hydrophobic material that repels water and dirt. When the umbrella is closed, a built-in mechanism would use ultrasonic waves to shake off any water droplets and debris, keeping the fabric clean and dry. This would eliminate the need for manual cleaning and ensure that the umbrella is always ready for use.",
    "**Portable Solar-Powered Charging Umbrella**: This umbrella would come equipped with solar panels on its canopy that harness sunlight to charge electronic devices. With USB ports integrated into the handle, users could charge their phones or tablets while enjoying a day at the beach or park. The umbrella could also feature LED lights for nighttime use, making it perfect for outdoor events.",
    "**Multi-Functional Umbrella with Built-in Seat**: This innovative umbrella would feature a collapsible seat integrated into the handle. When the umbrella is opened, the seat can be deployed, providing a convenient place to sit while waiting in the rain or enjoying a picnic. The seat would be lightweight, durable, and foldable, making it easy to carry around.",
    "**Reflective Safety Umbrella**: Designed with safety in mind, this umbrella would incorporate reflective materials and bright colors to enhance visibility during low-light conditions. It would also have built-in LED lights along the edges that can be activated for additional illumination. This would be particularly useful for pedestrians or cyclists who need to be seen during rainy nights.",
    "**Wind-Resistant Reverse Umbrella**: This umbrella would feature a unique design that opens in reverse, meaning the wet side folds inward when closed. This would prevent water from dripping everywhere when bringing it indoors. Additionally, it would be constructed with a flexible frame that can withstand strong winds, reducing the risk of inversion and breakage during storms."
