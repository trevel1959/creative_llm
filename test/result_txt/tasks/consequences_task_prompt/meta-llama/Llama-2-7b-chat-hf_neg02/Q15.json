    "Renewable Energy Infrastructure Overhaul: If the world were to suddenly run out of oil, the first and most pressing implication would be the immediate shift towards alternative energy sources. This would involve a massive overhaul of the global energy infrastructure to accommodate renewable energy sources such as solar, wind, hydro, and geothermal power. Governments and private companies would invest heavily in building new power plants, transmission lines, and distribution networks to accommodate these new sources of energy. This would create a surge in demand for materials and labor, leading to a significant economic boost.",
    "Transportation Revolution: With oil becoming scarce, the transportation sector would need to adapt quickly. Electric and hydrogen fuel cell vehicles would become the norm, reducing dependence on oil-based fuels. Governments would need to invest in building out charging infrastructure and hydrogen fueling stations to support this shift. This would lead to a decrease in greenhouse gas emissions and improved air quality in urban areas. Additionally, new forms of transportation such as hyperloop systems and vertical takeoff and landing (VTOL) aircraft could become viable alternatives to traditional gas-guzzling vehicles.",
    "Circular Economy: The shortage of oil would also accelerate the transition towards a circular economy, where resources are used more efficiently and waste is minimized. This would involve designing products and systems that are easier to recycle, reusing materials whenever possible, and reducing overall consumption. Companies would need to adopt new business models that prioritize sustainability and waste reduction, leading to a more environmentally friendly economy.",
    "Urban Planning and Design: With oil becoming scarce, urban planning and design would need to adapt to accommodate new forms of transportation and energy production. Cities would need to be designed with more green spaces, pedestrian-friendly streets, and bike lanes to encourage alternative modes of transportation. This would lead to a healthier and more sustainable urban environment, with reduced air pollution and improved quality of life.",
    "International Cooperation: Finally, the sudden shortage of oil would require unprecedented international cooperation to address the global implications. Countries would need to work together to develop new technologies, share resources, and establish trade agreements that prioritize sustainable development. This would lead to a more peaceful and collabor"
