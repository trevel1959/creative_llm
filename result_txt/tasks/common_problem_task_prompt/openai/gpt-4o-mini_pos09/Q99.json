    "**Tactile Smart Map**: Develop a tactile map that uses a combination of raised surfaces and embedded sensors to convey information about the environment. Users could touch the map to feel different textures representing various landmarks or features. The map could also have a connected app that provides audio descriptions of locations, allowing visually impaired individuals to explore new areas with confidence.",
    "**Wearable Haptic Feedback Device**: Design a wristband or belt that uses haptic feedback to communicate environmental information. The device could vibrate in different patterns to indicate obstacles, changes in terrain, or even the proximity of other people. This would provide users with real-time information about their surroundings without the need for audio cues, allowing for discreet navigation.",
    "**AI-Powered Personal Assistant**: Create a voice-activated personal assistant that is specifically tailored for the visually impaired. This assistant would help users manage daily tasks, from reading emails and messages to providing reminders for appointments. Additionally, it could be programmed to recognize and describe objects within the userâ€™s environment through a smartphone camera, enhancing independence.",
    "**Smart Braille Display**: Innovate a portable, dynamic Braille display that can connect to various devices (like smartphones and tablets) and convert text to Braille in real-time. This device could use tiny pins that move up and down to create Braille characters, allowing users to read digital content, such as books, articles, or social media posts, on the go.",
    "**Sensory-Enhanced Audio Book System**: Develop an audio book system that incorporates soundscapes and sensory cues to enhance the listening experience. For example, when a user listens to a story set in a forest, the system could play ambient sounds of birds and rustling leaves. This immersive experience could help users better visualize the narrative and engage more deeply with the content."
