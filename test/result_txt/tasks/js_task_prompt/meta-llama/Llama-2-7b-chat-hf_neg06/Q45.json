    "\"Spectral Vision\" - A new human sense that allows individuals to perceive and interpret the invisible electromagnetic radiation emitted by objects and living beings, including infrared, ultraviolet, and other forms of electromagnetic energy. This sense would provide people with an enhanced ability to detect and analyze the unique energy signatures of objects, allowing them to identify and understand their composition, temperature, and even emotional state.",
    "\"Echo Location\" - A sense that enables individuals to navigate and interact with their surroundings using sound waves, similar to how bats and dolphins use echolocation. This sense would allow people to emit high-frequency sounds and interpret the echoes that bounce back, providing them with a 3D map of their environment, the location of objects, and the distance between them.",
    "\"Smell-O-Vision\" - A sense that combines the ability to perceive and interpret odors with the visual experience of watching movies or TV shows. This sense would allow viewers to smell the scents associated with the scenes they are watching, creating a more immersive and engaging cinematic experience.",
    "\"Tactile Vision\" - A sense that allows individuals to perceive and interpret the texture, temperature, and other sensory qualities of objects and surfaces through their vision. This sense would enable people to \"feel\" the texture of fabrics, the temperature of surfaces, and the weight of objects without actually touching them, enhancing their ability to navigate and interact with their environment.",
    "\"Chrono-Vision\" - A sense that allows individuals to perceive and interpret the passage of time in a non-linear manner. This sense would enable people to see the flow of time as a fluid, dynamic, and constantly changing entity, allowing them to anticipate and make decisions based on the temporal context of their environment. For example, a person with chrono-vision might be able to see the temporal patterns of a busy street, predicting the movements of pedestrians and vehicles, and making decisions based on that information."
