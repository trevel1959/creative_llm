    "Intelligent Transportation System (ITS): Develop an integrated transportation management system that utilizes artificial intelligence, machine learning, and data analytics to optimize public transportation routes, schedules, and services. This system can analyze real-time traffic data, passenger demand, and other factors to minimize congestion, reduce travel times, and improve overall efficiency.",
    "Autonomous Vehicles: Implement autonomous buses and trains that can navigate through designated routes without human intervention. This technology can increase safety, reduce labor costs, and improve the overall passenger experience.",
    "Hyperloop System: Develop a high-speed transportation system that connects different parts of the city using vacuum-sealed tubes and magnetic levitation technology. This system can reduce travel times between destinations to just minutes, making it a more attractive option for long-distance commutes.",
    "Vertical Takeoff and Landing (VTOL) Aircraft: Develop and deploy VTOL aircraft that can take off and land vertically, eliminating the need for traditional runways. These aircraft can operate on designated routes, providing fast and efficient transportation between different parts of the city.",
    "Smart Buses: Upgrade existing buses with advanced technologies such as real-time traffic updates, GPS tracking, and automated fare collection systems. This will improve the overall passenger experience, reduce commute times, and make public transportation more convenient and accessible."
