    "**Exoskeleton Suit**: A wearable exoskeleton could enable individuals to stand and walk again, even if they cannot do so naturally. This suit would be equipped with motors and sensors that respond to the user’s intentions. With training, users could control the suit with their movements, allowing them to walk, climb stairs, or even run. The suit could also have features that provide feedback on posture and movement, enhancing rehabilitation and physical fitness.",
    "**Personal Mobility Drone**: Envision a small, personal drone that can lift and transport a person in a seated position. This drone would be equipped with advanced stabilization technology and sensors to navigate through various terrains and environments. Users could control the drone via a mobile app or voice commands, making it an innovative way to travel short distances, especially in crowded or inaccessible areas.",
    "**Smart Robotic Scooter**: A robotic scooter that autonomously navigates based on the user’s desired destination. Users would simply input their destination via a touchscreen or voice command, and the scooter would take them there while avoiding obstacles and following traffic rules. The scooter could also have a collapsible design for easy storage and transport, making it a versatile option for both indoor and outdoor mobility.",
    "**Interactive Floor Tiles**: Imagine a home or public space where the floor is made up of interactive tiles that respond to the user's movements. If someone is unable to stand, they could use a mobility device to roll over the tiles, which would light up and create a path to guide them to their destination. The tiles could also provide sensory feedback, like vibrations or sounds, to enhance the navigation experience and make it more engaging.",
    "**Portable Hoverboard with Stability Features**: A hoverboard designed specifically for individuals with mobility challenges. This board would have a wider base for stability and built-in gyroscopic sensors to maintain balance. Users could control their movement with gentle shifts in weight, and the board could have safety features like automatic braking and obstacle detection. This would provide a fun and modern way to get around without the need for traditional mobility aids."
