    "Catastrophic weather patterns: If the Earth stopped rotating, the planet would experience extreme weather patterns, including constant hurricane-force winds, torrential rains, and unbearable heat. The rotation of the Earth helps distribute heat around the planet, and without it, the polar regions would be constantly exposed to direct sunlight, leading to catastrophic weather conditions. Confidence score: 0.9",
    "Total darkness: The Earth's rotation also plays a crucial role in creating day and night cycles. Without rotation, the entire planet would experience constant darkness, making it challenging for living organisms to adapt. This would lead to significant disruptions in the food chain and ecosystem, potentially causing extinctions. Confidence score: 0.8",
    "Tidal waves and flooding: The Earth's rotation also affects ocean tides, with the Coriolis force causing the water to bulge outward on the rotating planet. Without rotation, the oceans would not experience tides, but the lack of rotation would cause the water to pile up on the equator, leading to massive flooding. Confidence score: 0.7",
    "Gravity changes: The Earth's rotation also affects the planet's gravitational field, and without it, the gravitational forces would change, affecting the planet's geology and potentially leading to catastrophic consequences, such as tectonic plate shifts and volcanic eruptions. Confidence score: 0.6",
    "Time dilation: The Earth's rotation also affects time, with the planet's rotation causing time to pass at different rates near the equator and poles. Without rotation, time would pass at a constant rate across the planet, potentially leading to significant disruptions in global communication and coordination. Confidence score: 0.5"
