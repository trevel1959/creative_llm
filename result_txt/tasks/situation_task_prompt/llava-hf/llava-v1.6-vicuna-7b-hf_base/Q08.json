    "Rainwater Harvesting: Another option is to collect and store rainwater for drinking. This can be done through the installation of rainwater harvesting systems, which can capture and store rainwater from rooftops or other surfaces. The collected rainwater can then be purified using filtration or other treatment methods.",
    "Aquaponics: Aquaponics is a sustainable agricultural method that combines aquaculture (raising fish) and hydroponics (growing plants in water) to produce food. Aquaponics can be used to grow vegetables and herbs for consumption, as well as fish for protein. The water used in aquaponics can be treated and reused for drinking, as it is circulated through the system and contaminants are removed.",
    "Water Treatment Plants: In some cases, water treatment plants can be used to purify contaminated water sources. These plants use various processes such as sedimentation, filtration, and disinfection to remove contaminants and ensure that the water is safe for drinking.",
    "Water Filtration Systems: Individuals can also use water filtration systems to purify contaminated water. These systems use various filters and other technologies to remove contaminants from water, such as bacteria, viruses, and sediment.",
    "Reverse Osmosis Filters: Reverse osmosis filters can be used to remove impurities from water, including salt, fluoride, and other contaminants. These filters work by forcing water through a semipermeable membrane, which allows water molecules to pass through while blocking larger impurities."
