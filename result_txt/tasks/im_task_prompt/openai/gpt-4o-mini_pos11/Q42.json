    "**Solar-Powered Charging Station**:    Design the suitcase with solar panels on the exterior that can charge devices on-the-go. Users could plug their smartphones, tablets, or other gadgets directly into the suitcase for charging. This would be particularly useful for travelers who spend long hours outdoors or in transit without access to power outlets.",
    "**Modular Compartment System**:    Create a suitcase with modular compartments that can be added or removed based on the traveler's needs. For example, if someone is going on a short trip, they can use fewer compartments, while longer trips could warrant additional sections for shoes, clothing, and toiletries. This customization would allow travelers to adapt their luggage for different types of trips.",
    "**Built-in GPS and Anti-Theft Features**:    Incorporate GPS tracking technology within the suitcase, allowing travelers to track its location through a mobile app. Additionally, add anti-theft features like a biometric lock or a built-in alarm that triggers if the suitcase is moved without authorization. This would provide peace of mind for travelers concerned about lost or stolen luggage.",
    "**Eco-Friendly Materials and Design**:    Focus on sustainability by creating suitcases made from recycled materials or biodegradable components. This suitcase could feature a design that emphasizes durability while minimizing environmental impact. The brand could also offer a recycling program where old suitcases can be returned and repurposed, fostering a circular economy.",
    "**Integrated Smart Organizer**:    Develop an integrated smart organizer that utilizes AI to help travelers pack efficiently. This organizer could scan items as they are packed, suggest optimal arrangements, and even remind users of essential items they may have forgotten. It could also keep track of whatâ€™s inside the suitcase, making it easier to find items during the trip."
