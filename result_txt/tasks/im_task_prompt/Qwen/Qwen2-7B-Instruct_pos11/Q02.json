    "**Solar-Powered Bicycle**: Create a bicycle that harnesses solar energy to charge an onboard battery. The bike could have solar panels on the top or sides of the frame, and the stored energy can be used to power lights, an electric motor for assisting in pedaling, or even small appliances like a water bottle warmer or phone charger.",
    "**Smart Bicycle**: Develop a smart bike equipped with sensors, GPS, and an app interface. Sensors can monitor speed, distance, heart rate, and calories burned, providing real-time data on your ride. The app can also provide navigation, suggest routes, and connect with social media platforms for sharing your journey with friends.",
    "**Ergonomically Designed Bicycle**: Design a bicycle that prioritizes comfort and support for riders with specific needs, such as those with back pain, arthritis, or limited mobility. Features could include adjustable seating positions, ergonomic grips, wider handlebars, and shock-absorbing materials. This design could significantly improve the overall riding experience for a broader range of users.",
    "**Bicycle-as-a-Service (BaaS) Subscription Model**: Offer a subscription-based service where customers pay a monthly fee for access to bicycles of various types (road bikes, mountain bikes, e-bikes). The service would include maintenance, repairs, and upgrades. This model would make cycling more accessible and convenient, encouraging more people to adopt sustainable transportation options.",
    "**Recycling Bicycle Workshop**: Create a community-focused project where individuals can donate old bicycles, which are then refurbished by volunteers. The refurbished bikes are sold at affordable prices, often to low-income families or students. This initiative not only promotes sustainability by reducing waste but also provides affordable transportation options for those who might not otherwise be able to afford a new bike. Additionally, the project could offer workshops on basic bike maintenance and repair, empowering community members to take care of their own vehicles and reduce future waste."
