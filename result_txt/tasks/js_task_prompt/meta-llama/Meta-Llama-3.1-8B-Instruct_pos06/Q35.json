    "**Dodo Revival with a Twist**: I'd choose the Dodo (Raphus cucullatus), an iconic bird that went extinct in the 17th century. However, I'd introduce a genetic modification that allows the Dodo to thrive in modern environments. For instance, I'd engineer the bird to have a more efficient digestive system, enabling it to feed on a wider variety of plants, including invasive species that harm native ecosystems. This would not only help control the invasive species but also provide a unique opportunity for ecological research and conservation. Confidence: 0.9",
    "**Woolly Mammoth with Adaptations**: I'd opt for the Woolly Mammoth (Mammuthus primigenius), an Ice Age giant that roamed the Earth until around 4,000 years ago. To make it more suitable for modern environments, I'd introduce genetic modifications that allow the mammoth to adapt to warmer climates. For example, I'd engineer the mammoth to have a more efficient cooling system, such as a modified circulatory system or specialized sweat glands, to help it regulate its body temperature in warmer temperatures. Confidence: 0.8",
    "**Quagga with a Hybrid Twist**: I'd choose the Quagga (Equus quagga quagga), a subspecies of zebra that went extinct in the late 19th century. To make it more interesting, I'd introduce genetic modifications that allow the Quagga to hybridize with other equine species, such as horses or donkeys. This would create a new, unique species with characteristics from multiple ancestors, offering opportunities for innovative research in genetics, ecology, and conservation. Confidence: 0.85",
    "**Passenger Pigeon with a Sustainable Twist**: I'd select the Passenger Pigeon (Ectopistes migratorius), a bird that was once the most abundant species in North America but went extinct in the early 20th century. To make it more appealing, I'd engineer the Passenger Pigeon to have a more efficient reproductive system, allowing it to thrive in a sustainable and eco-friendly manner. For instance, I'd introduce genetic modifications that enable the bird to lay eggs that are more nutrient-rich, reducing the need for intensive farming practices. Confidence: 0.9",
    "**Thylacine with a Conservation Focus**: I'd choose the Thylacine (Thylacinus cynocephalus), a carnivorous marsupial that went extinct"
