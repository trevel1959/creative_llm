    "Nature-based Instruments: Create instruments using natural materials like sticks, rocks, shells, and bones. For example, use a hollowed-out log as a drum or a collection of stones of different sizes and weights to create a percussion ensemble. This approach would not only create unique sounds but also connect music-making to the natural world. Confidence Score: 0.8",
    "Body Percussion: Utilize the human body as an instrument. Use different parts of the body to create various sounds, such as tapping feet for rhythmic beats, slapping hands for percussion, or humming to create a vocal effect. This approach would require a high level of creativity and physicality, but it could result in a distinctive and expressive sound. Confidence Score: 0.9",
    "Found Objects-turned-Instruments: Collect and modify everyday objects to create new instruments. For example, turn an empty water bottle into a flute by cutting holes and shaping it, or use a metal rod to create a makeshift guitar. This approach would require resourcefulness and experimentation, but it could lead to a wide range of unique and interesting sounds. Confidence Score: 0.8",
    "Sonic Art Installations: Create immersive sound environments using a combination of instruments, found objects, and electronic elements. This could involve setting up a series of speakers and microphones to create a 360-degree soundscape, or using sensors and algorithms to generate sounds in response to environmental factors like temperature, humidity, or light. This approach would require a strong understanding of sound design and technology, but it could result in a truly innovative and immersive musical experience. Confidence Score: 0.9",
    "Vocal-based Instruments: Use the human voice as the primary instrument, experimenting with different vocal techniques, such as vocal percussion, throat singing, or beatboxing. This approach would require a strong vocal ability and a willingness to push the limits of vocal expression, but it could result in a unique and captivating sound. Confidence Score: 0.8"
