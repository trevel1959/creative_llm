    "Create a laundry basket that doubles as a garden planter. The bottom of the basket would be made of waterproof material to prevent any water from seeping through. The sides of the basket could be lined with soil and seeds to create a small garden inside the laundry basket.",
    "Design a laundry basket that can hold multiple loads at once. It would have a large capacity and multiple compartments to separate different types of clothes or items. This would save time and make doing laundry more efficient.",
    "Create a laundry basket that converts into a bookshelf. The basket could be made of durable materials and designed with shelves that can easily be adjusted to fit books of various sizes. This would be a great solution for those who don't have enough space for both a bookshelf and a laundry basket.",
    "Design a laundry basket that can be attached to a wall. This would free up valuable floor space in a small apartment or dorm room. The basket could be made of lightweight materials and feature wheels so it can easily be moved around when needed.",
    "Create a laundry basket that incorporates a water filtration system. This would allow users to collect water from their washing machine and use it for other household chores, such as watering plants or cleaning windows.
