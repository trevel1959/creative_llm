    "**Hitchhiking Network App**: Develop a mobile application that connects travelers looking for rides with drivers who have spare seats. Users can create profiles, verify identities, and rate each other to ensure safety and trust. The app could feature route planning tools, allowing users to find the best pick-up and drop-off points, and even include a social aspect where travelers can share their experiences, tips, and travel stories.",
    "**Long-Distance Walking Tours**: Create guided long-distance walking tours that incorporate local attractions, nature trails, and historical sites. These tours could be organized by local tourism boards or independent companies, providing a structured itinerary for participants. Travelers can enjoy the journey at a leisurely pace, meet new people, and experience the landscape intimately. Accommodation and meals can be arranged along the route to enhance the experience.",
    "**Animal-Pulled Transport**: Revive traditional forms of transport using animals, such as horse-drawn carriages or oxen carts. This could be particularly appealing in rural areas where the terrain is suitable. Communities could establish a network of farmers and animal owners willing to provide transport services, allowing travelers to experience a slower, more scenic journey while promoting local agriculture and tourism.",
    "**Solar-Powered Electric Scooters**: Introduce a rental service for solar-powered electric scooters that can be used for long-distance travel. These scooters would be equipped with solar panels to recharge during the day, allowing for eco-friendly travel. The service could include designated charging stations along popular routes, and users could easily locate available scooters via a mobile app, ensuring convenience and sustainability.",
    "**Train and Boat Combination**: If train services are still operational in certain regions, travelers can utilize trains to reach coastal areas or river ports, where they can switch to boat transport. This method would allow for scenic travel along waterways, providing a unique perspective of the landscape. Special packages could be created for travelers, combining train and boat tickets with meals and guided tours to enhance the experience."
