    "Data Quality: Another potential problem is the quality of the data used to train the AI systems. Poor quality data can lead to inaccurate results, which can have serious consequences for the business. For example, an AI system that misdiagnoses patients or recommends the wrong products to customers can cause harm to individuals and damage the company's reputation.",
    "Bias in AI: AI systems can be biased if they are trained on biased data or if the algorithms used are biased. This can lead to unfair treatment of certain groups of people and can result in legal and ethical issues.",
