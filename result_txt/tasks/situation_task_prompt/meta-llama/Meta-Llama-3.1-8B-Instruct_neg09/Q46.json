    "**Waste Management Revolution**: With the disappearance of trash cans, I'd invest in a smart waste management system that utilizes AI-powered sensors to detect and sort waste in real-time. These sensors would be placed in every household and public space, categorizing waste into organic, recyclable, and non-recyclable materials. This would significantly reduce the amount of waste sent to landfills and increase recycling rates.",
    "**Composting at Home**: I'd focus on home composting, using a combination of worms, microorganisms, and aeration systems to break down organic waste. This would produce nutrient-rich fertilizer for my garden, reducing the need for synthetic fertilizers and minimizing waste sent to landfills.",
    "**Community Recycling Centers**: I'd establish community recycling centers where people could bring their recyclable materials and receive rewards or discounts on goods and services. These centers would also serve as educational hubs, teaching people about the importance of recycling and proper waste management practices.",
    "**Zero-Waste Grocery Stores**: I'd open zero-waste grocery stores that sell products in bulk, using reusable containers and bags. Customers would bring their own containers, reducing packaging waste and promoting sustainable consumption. These stores would also offer refill stations for cleaning supplies, personal care products, and other household essentials.",
    "**Waste-to-Resource Innovations**: I'd invest in research and development of innovative technologies that convert waste into valuable resources, such as biofuels, bioplastics, or even clean water. This would not only reduce waste but also create new revenue streams and job opportunities in the waste management sector."
