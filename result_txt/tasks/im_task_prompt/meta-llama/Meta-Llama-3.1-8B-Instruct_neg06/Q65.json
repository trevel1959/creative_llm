    "**Eco-Friendly Electric Kettle with Integrated Water Purification System**: Design an electric kettle that not only boils water efficiently but also comes equipped with a built-in water purification system. This system can use UV light, ceramic filters, or other eco-friendly technologies to remove impurities and contaminants from the water, making it safe for drinking. The kettle could also have a built-in water quality sensor that alerts the user when the water needs to be replaced or purified.",
    "**Smart Electric Kettle with Automated Recipe Suggestions**: Develop an electric kettle that can connect to a user's smartphone or tablet via Bluetooth or Wi-Fi. The kettle could have a built-in database of recipes that require specific water temperatures, and it could automatically suggest recipes based on the user's cooking preferences and the ingredients they have at home. The kettle could also integrate with popular cooking apps to provide users with step-by-step cooking instructions.",
    "**Electric Kettle with Integrated Food Thermometer**: Design an electric kettle that comes with a built-in food thermometer, allowing users to monitor the internal temperature of their food while it's cooking. This feature would be particularly useful for cooking delicate dishes like eggs, fish, or meat. The thermometer could be a separate probe that can be inserted into the food, or it could be a built-in sensor that uses infrared technology to measure the temperature.",
    "**Electric Kettle with Automatic Cleaning and Descaling System**: Develop an electric kettle that can automatically clean and descale itself, reducing the risk of limescale buildup and bacterial growth. The kettle could have a built-in cleaning cycle that uses a mixture of water and vinegar to remove mineral deposits and bacteria. It could also have a descaling system that uses a combination of citric acid and water to remove limescale buildup.",
    "**Electric Kettle with Integrated Sound Wave Technology for Perfect Tea Brewing**: Design an electric kettle that uses sound wave technology to create the perfect brewing conditions for tea. The kettle could have a built-in speaker that produces a specific sound wave frequency that helps to release the optimal amount of flavor and aroma from the tea leaves. This feature would be particularly useful for tea enthusiasts who want to achieve the perfect cup of tea every time. The kettle could also have a built-in temperature control system that ensures the water is at the ideal temperature for brewing tea."
