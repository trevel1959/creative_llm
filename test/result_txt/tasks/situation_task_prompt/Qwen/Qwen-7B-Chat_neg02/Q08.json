    "Desalination Plant: A desalination plant is a facility that removes salt and other minerals from seawater or brackish water to make it safe for drinking. It works by using a process called reverse osmosis, where the water is forced through a semi-permeable membrane that allows water molecules to pass but blocks larger contaminants.",
    "Rainwater Harvesting: Rainwater harvesting involves collecting rainwater from rooftops, pavements, and other surfaces and storing it in tanks or cisterns for later use. This method can be used in areas where tap water is scarce or contaminated.",
    "Water Filtration Systems: Water filtration systems are devices that remove impurities and contaminants from water. They can be installed at home or community level and come in different types such as ceramic filters, activated carbon filters, and ultraviolet filters.",
    "Cloud Seeding: Cloud seeding involves adding substances like silver iodide or dry ice into clouds to encourage precipitation. The water droplets in the cloud collect these particles and fall to the ground as rain or snow, providing fresh water.",
    "Water Recycling: Water recycling involves treating wastewater to make it suitable for reuse. This can include processes such as biological treatment, chemical treatment, and advanced oxidation processes. Recycled water can be used for irrigation, industrial processes, and even drinking water in some cases."
