    "**Adjustable Multi-Size Hanger**: Create a hanger that can be easily adjusted to accommodate various clothing sizes. This would involve a telescoping design or a sliding mechanism that allows the hanger to expand or contract. This would be especially useful for households with multiple sizes of clothing, such as childrenâ€™s clothes that often change sizes.",
    "**Hanger with Built-in LED Lighting**: Design a hanger that incorporates soft LED lighting to illuminate clothes in dark closets.

These hangers could be made from bamboo or recycled paper, and they could also feature a stylish design that appeals to eco-conscious consumers.",
    "**Hanger with Built-in Clips for Accessories**: Innovate a hanger that includes detachable clips or hooks for holding accessories such as scarves, belts, or ties. This would help keep the closet organized and allow users to display complete outfits on a single hanger, making it easier to choose what to wear.",
    "**Magnetic Hanger System**: Create a magnetic hanger system where multiple hangers can stick together or to a magnetic wall strip. This would allow users to easily group outfits or keep their closet tidy by organizing clothes vertically, thus saving space and making items more accessible."
