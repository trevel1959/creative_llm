    "Size and Shape: Another way to differentiate objects would be by their size and shape. By measuring the dimensions of objects and comparing them to each other, you could determine which object is larger or smaller. Additionally, the shape of objects would still be visible, allowing you to recognize them even without color.",
    "Material: The material of an object could also be discerned without color. For instance, you could identify a metal object by its hardness and the sound it makes when struck, a wooden object by its grain and the way it smells, or a plastic object by its flexibility and transparency.",
    "Sound: Objects often make different sounds when interacted with. By listening to the sounds that objects make when touched or moved, you could differentiate between them. For example, the sound of a rubber band stretching would be different from the sound of a metal spring being compressed.",
    "Smell: The scent of objects could also be a way to differentiate between them. Each object has a unique smell that is tied to its material and manufacturing process. By smelling objects, you could identify their type.",
    "Temperature: The temperature of objects could be another distinguishing factor. Objects made of different materials have different thermal properties, and you could feel the difference between them. For example, a metal object would be colder than a wooden object."
