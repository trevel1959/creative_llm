    "**Solar-Powered Haven**: Create a self-sustaining shelter using solar panels to generate electricity, collect rainwater, and grow a hydroponic garden. This setup would provide a reliable source of food, water, and energy, making it possible to survive without external power.",
    "**Wind-Powered Water Purification**: Develop a wind-powered water purification system that utilizes wind energy to drive a turbine, which in turn powers a water filtration system. This would provide access to clean drinking water, even in areas with limited or no electricity.",
    "**Community-Driven Power Generation**: Establish a community-driven power generation system where members work together to create a network of small-scale renewable energy sources, such as solar panels, wind turbines, and hydroelectric generators. This collective effort would provide a reliable source of power for the community.",
    "**Bio-Luminescent Lighting**: Utilize bioluminescent organisms, such as glowworms or bacteria, to create a sustainable lighting source. This would eliminate the need for electricity and provide a unique, eco-friendly lighting solution.",
    "**Underground Greenhouse**: Design an underground greenhouse that utilizes natural temperature regulation and insulation to create a stable environment for growing a variety of crops. This would provide a reliable source of food and reduce the need for external energy sources.
