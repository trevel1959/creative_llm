    "Braille-to-Speech Synthesizer: Develop a device that converts braille letters into spoken words, allowing visually impaired individuals to read and communicate more easily. This device could be worn as a wristband or pendant, and use machine learning algorithms to recognize braille characters and translate them into spoken language.",
    "Smart Cane: Create a smart cane that provides real-time information about the environment to visually impaired individuals. This cane could include sensors to detect obstacles, such as curbs or stairs, and provide haptic feedback to help users navigate their surroundings more safely. The cane could also include a GPS tracker to help users navigate unfamiliar areas.",
    "Eye-tracking Glasses: Develop glasses with eye-tracking technology that allows visually impaired individuals to control their electronic devices using only their eyes. This technology could be used to control smartphones, tablets, and other devices, allowing users to communicate, access information, and perform tasks more easily.",
    "Tactile Displays: Create a tactile display system that allows visually impaired individuals to read and interact with digital content in a more tactile way. This system could use raised dots or bumps to represent digital information, such as text or images, and allow users to feel and navigate through digital content more easily.",
    "Artificial Intelligence-based Object Recognition: Develop an AI-based system that can recognize objects and provide information about them to visually impaired individuals. This system could use computer vision algorithms to identify objects and provide information about their shape, size, color, and other characteristics, allowing users to navigate their environment more easily and independently."
