    "Build a Solar-Powered Generator: Create a portable, solar-powered generator that can charge essential devices like phones, laptops, and flashlights. This can be achieved by using a solar panel, a battery, and a DC-DC converter. The generator can be powered by the sun during the day and used to charge devices at night.",
    "Create a Rainwater Collection System: Design a rainwater collection system that can harvest and store rainwater for drinking, cooking, and hygiene purposes. This can be done using a series of gutters, a storage tank, and a filtration system. The collected rainwater can be used for all household needs, reducing the need for electricity-based water supply systems.",
    "Build a Composting Toilet: Design a composting toilet that can convert human waste into a nutrient-rich compost. This can be achieved by using a combination of natural microorganisms, carbon materials, and airtight containers. The compost can be used as fertilizer for plants, reducing the need for chemical fertilizers and providing a sustainable solution for waste management.",
    "Create a Food Preservation System: Develop a food preservation system that can preserve food without electricity. This can be done using natural methods like drying, canning, and fermentation. For example, you can use a solar oven to dry fruits and vegetables, or a manual canner to preserve vegetables and meats. Fermentation can be used to preserve dairy products like yogurt and cheese.",
    "Build a Wind-Powered Water Pump: Design a wind-powered water pump that can extract water from a well or a water source without electricity. This can be achieved by using a windmill or a vertical-axis wind turbine to power a water pump. The pump can be used to extract water from a well or a water source, providing a sustainable solution for irrigation and drinking water."
