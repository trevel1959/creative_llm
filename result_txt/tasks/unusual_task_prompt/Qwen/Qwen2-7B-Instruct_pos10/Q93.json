    "**Incorporating Technology into Vases**: Design a vase that is not just decorative but also functional. You could create a smart vase that can regulate its temperature, ensuring that flowers stay fresher for longer periods. The vase would have sensors that detect water levels and moisture around the roots of the flowers. When the water level gets low or the moisture drops below a certain threshold, the vase would automatically alert the user via a smartphone app or sound an alarm.",
    "**Interactive Vase Sculptures**: Create vases that are interactive sculptures. These could be made from a variety of materials like wood, metal, or even recycled glass. They could have hidden compartments where users can store small items like jewelry or photos. A simple mechanism or a QR code on the base of the vase could unlock these compartments when scanned with a smartphone.",
    "**Personalized Vases with Customized Engravings**: Offer vases that can be personalized with engravings. This could include names, dates, quotes, or designs chosen by the customer. You could use laser engraving or traditional hand carving techniques to make each vase unique. This would add a personal touch to any space, making it a cherished gift or keepsake.",
    "**Eco-Friendly Vases Made from Sustainable Materials**: Develop a line of vases made from sustainable materials such as bamboo, reclaimed wood, or recycled plastic bottles. These vases could come in a variety of shapes and sizes, appealing to different interior design styles. By promoting eco-friendliness, you're not only contributing to sustainability but also tapping into the growing market of environmentally conscious consumers.",
    "**Therapeutic Vases for Well-being**: Design vases that promote mental well-being. For example, you could incorporate crystals into the vase's design, which are believed to have healing properties. Each crystal could be associated with a specific emotion or health benefit. Additionally, you might include a small booklet inside the vase, offering tips on how to care for the crystals and their intended benefits. This would turn the vase into a daily reminder of self-care and relaxation."
