    "**Modular Helmet Design**: Create a helmet with detachable components that can be customized based on the type of ride. For example, riders could attach a visor for sunny days, a face shield for winter riding, or additional padding for mountain biking. This modularity would allow cyclists to adapt their helmet to different conditions and preferences easily.",
    "**Built-in Communication System**: Incorporate a Bluetooth communication system that allows cyclists to connect with their smartphones or other cyclists. This system could facilitate hands-free phone calls, music playback, and even intercom features for group rides, ensuring that riders can stay connected without compromising safety.",
    "**Integrated Safety Lights and Reflectors**: Design the helmet with built-in LED lights and reflective materials that activate based on ambient light conditions. For example, lights could automatically turn on at dusk or in low visibility situations, and the reflective surface could increase visibility from all angles, enhancing safety during night rides.",
    "**Advanced Ventilation System**: Develop a helmet with an adjustable ventilation system that can be controlled via a smartphone app. Cyclists could open or close vents based on temperature and personal comfort, ensuring optimal airflow during long rides. This feature would help regulate temperature and prevent overheating, especially in hot climates.",
    "**Impact-Absorbing Technology**: Use innovative materials that provide better impact absorption than traditional foam. For instance, incorporating liquid or gel-based materials that harden upon impact could enhance protection without adding extra weight. This technology would improve safety while maintaining comfort and flexibility during regular use."
