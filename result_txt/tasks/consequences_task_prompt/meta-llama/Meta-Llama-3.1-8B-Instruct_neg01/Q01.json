People would need to adapt to a more active and interactive lifestyle, leading to increased social connections and community engagement.

This would also lead to a decrease in traffic-related stress and anxiety, promoting a more relaxed and peaceful environment.",
    "**Urban Planning Revolution**: The replacement of cars with bicycles would force cities to rethink their urban planning strategies. Cities would need to prioritize bike-friendly infrastructure, pedestrian-friendly spaces, and green areas.
