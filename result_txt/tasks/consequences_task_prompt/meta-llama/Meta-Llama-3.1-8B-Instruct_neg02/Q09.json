    "**The Great Inversion**: The reduced gravity would cause the Earth's oceans to bulge outwards, creating massive inland seas and flooding coastal cities. The resulting changes in ocean currents and tides would lead to unpredictable and catastrophic weather patterns, making it difficult for humans to adapt and survive.",
    "**The Rise of the Sky Cities**: With half the gravity, people would build sprawling metropolises in the sky, using advanced materials and technologies to construct megastructures that defy gravity. These sky cities would become hubs of innovation and commerce, but also pose significant challenges for governance, infrastructure, and resource management.",
    "**The New Era of Flight**: A halved gravity would revolutionize transportation, making it possible for humans to fly without the need for aircraft. People would build massive, gravity-defying wingsuits and harness the power of updrafts to soar through the skies. This would lead to a new era of exploration and discovery, but also raise concerns about air traffic control and safety.",
    "**The Great Migration**: The reduced gravity would cause massive earthquakes and volcanic eruptions as the planet's tectonic plates adjust to the new gravitational forces. This would lead to a massive migration of people from coastal areas to inland regions, creating new social and economic challenges. Governments and international organizations would need to work together to provide aid and support to affected populations.",
    "**The Rise of the Aquatic Empire**: With half the gravity, the oceans would become the dominant environment for human civilization. People would build massive underwater cities, harnessing the power of the ocean currents and using advanced technologies to cultivate vast underwater farms. This would lead to a new era of aquatic exploration and discovery, but also raise concerns about the impact of human activity on marine ecosystems."
