    "**Innovative Hat Design**: Create a custom-made, breathable, UV-resistant hat that not only protects the head but also accommodates hair loss by having an adjustable inner layer for a snug fit. This could be made of materials like mesh nylon or fine silk that allows air to circulate and prevents scalp overheating.",
    "**Transparent Sunscreen Hat**: Develop a transparent hat made from a special fabric coated with sunscreen technology. This allows light to pass through while blocking harmful UV rays, providing protection without covering up bald areas.",
    "**Customized Cooling Cap**: Design a cooling cap that uses phase change materials (PCMs) embedded in its structure. These materials absorb heat when it's applied and release it as it cools, helping maintain a comfortable temperature on the scalp even during hot weather.",
    "**Reflective Bandana**: Craft a bandana from a reflective material that can be tied around the head. The bandana reflects sunlight away from the bald area, minimizing exposure and preventing sunburn.",
    "**Adhesive UV Shield**: Create a temporary, non-toxic adhesive strip that can be applied directly to the bald scalp. This strip is infused with sunscreen and can be easily removed and reapplied as needed throughout the day, ensuring continuous protection against sunburn. "
