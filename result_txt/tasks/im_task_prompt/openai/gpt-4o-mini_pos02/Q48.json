    "**Modular Piano Design**: Create a piano that can be customized with detachable modules. For instance, users could add extra keys, percussion pads, or even string instruments that can be played alongside the piano. This would cater to different musical styles and preferences, allowing musicians to create a personalized instrument that evolves with their skills and interests.",
    "**Virtual Reality Piano Experience**: Develop a virtual reality system that allows users to experience playing the piano in various environments, such as a grand concert hall or a serene forest. The VR system could also simulate the presence of a live audience or a teacher, enhancing practice sessions and performance preparation. This immersive experience could help musicians develop their skills while enjoying a unique and engaging atmosphere.",
    "**Eco-Friendly Piano Materials**: Innovate a line of pianos made from sustainable materials, such as bamboo or recycled wood. Additionally, the pianos could be designed to be energy-efficient, utilizing solar panels to power electronic features or built-in speakers. This approach not only appeals to environmentally conscious consumers but also promotes a message of sustainability in the music industry.",
    "**Piano with Built-in Composition Tools**: Imagine a piano that includes a digital interface for composing music directly on the instrument. This feature could allow users to record their playing, layer tracks, and add effects, all while playing on the keys. The built-in tools could also provide chord suggestions, rhythm patterns, and even AI-generated melodies to inspire creativity and assist in the composition process.",
    "**Adaptive Piano for Accessibility**: Design a piano that caters to individuals with disabilities. This could include features like adjustable key height, customizable touch sensitivity, and visual aids for those with visual impairments. The piano could also have an audio feedback system that describes the notes being played or offers guidance for those who need assistance, making music more accessible to everyone."
