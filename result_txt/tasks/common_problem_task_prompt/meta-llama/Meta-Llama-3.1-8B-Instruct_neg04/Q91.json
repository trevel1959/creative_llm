    "**Aqueducts for the Future**: Develop a sustainable and eco-friendly aqueduct system that harnesses the power of solar energy to purify and transport water from a reliable source to communities in need. The aqueducts would be designed with a unique, self-sustaining mechanism that collects and stores rainwater, allowing for a consistent water supply even during dry seasons.",
    "**Water ATM**: Create a network of Water ATMs (Automated Tapping Machines) that provide clean drinking water at an affordable price. These ATMs would be installed in public spaces and would use advanced filtration systems to purify water from a local source. Users would pay a small fee, and the machine would dispense a set amount of clean water.",
    "**Eco-Friendly Water Bottles**: Design a line of biodegradable, compostable water bottles made from plant-based materials. These bottles would be designed to be easily recyclable and would help reduce plastic waste in developing countries. The bottles would also have a built-in filter that removes impurities from the water, making it safe to drink.",
    "**Water Recycling and Reuse**: Implement a water recycling and reuse program that collects, treats, and reuses greywater (wastewater generated from sinks, showers, and washing machines) for non-potable purposes such as irrigation and toilet flushing. This would not only conserve water but also reduce the burden on municipal water supplies.",
    "**Community-Driven Water Wells**: Establish a community-driven initiative to build and maintain water wells in rural areas. The initiative would provide training and resources for local communities to take ownership of their water wells, ensuring that they are properly maintained and protected. This would not only provide access to clean water but also empower local communities to take control of their water resources.
