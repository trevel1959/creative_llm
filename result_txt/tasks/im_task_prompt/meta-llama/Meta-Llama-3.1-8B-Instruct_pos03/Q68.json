[/INST] Assistant: Here are 5 creative and original ideas for a calculator: 1. **Aquacalculator**: A waterproof calculator designed for underwater use. It would have a high-resolution display and buttons that can withstand the pressure of the deep ocean. The calculator would come equipped with a special algorithm that can calculate the pressure and buoyancy of objects underwater, making it an essential tool for marine biologists, engineers, and researchers. The Aquacalculator would also have a built-in compass and GPS, allowing users to navigate underwater with precision."
