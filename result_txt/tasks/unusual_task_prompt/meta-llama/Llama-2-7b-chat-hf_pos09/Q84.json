    "Smart Trash Can: Create a trash can with a built-in compactor that can compress trash, reducing the amount of space it takes up.

The trash can could also have a sensor that can detect when it's full and alert the user when it's time to empty it.",
    "Trash Can with a Purpose: Create a trash can that serves a dual purpose. For example, you could design a trash can that doubles as a planter. The trash can could have a removable inner container that can be used to plant small herbs or succulents. This would add a touch of greenery to your home while also providing a place to dispose of trash.",
    "Interactive Trash Can: Create a trash can that interacts with the user. For example, you could design a trash can that plays music or lights up when someone approaches it. This would add a fun and playful element to your home and make disposing of trash more enjoyable.",
    "Trash Can with a Historical Twist: Create a trash can that pays homage to a historical figure or event. For example, you could design a trash can that looks like a vintage suitcase, complete with a handle and luggage tags.
