    "A self-sustaining vertical farm, where plants grow upwards on a spiral-shaped trellis. The structure is designed to maximize space, with each plant having its own dedicated area for optimal growth. A network of micro-irrigation systems ensures precise watering, and a built-in LED lighting system simulates natural sunlight. The farm is powered by a combination of solar panels and kinetic energy generated by the movement of the plants as they grow.",
    "A wearable device that uses bio-sensing technology to monitor and regulate the user's mental health. The device, shaped like a wristband, features a soft, flexible display that changes color and pattern in response to the user's emotions. It also includes a built-in AI-powered chatbot that provides personalized advice and coping strategies. The device is powered by a small, rechargeable battery that can be charged wirelessly.",
    "A modular, prefabricated housing system that can be easily assembled and disassembled as needed. Each module is a self-contained unit with its own kitchen, bathroom, and living area. The modules are connected by a series of interlocking panels, allowing for easy reconfiguration and expansion. The system is designed to be energy-efficient, with solar panels and a rainwater harvesting system built into each module.",
    "A public art installation that uses augmented reality (AR) technology to bring a city's hidden history to life. The installation features a series of large, interactive screens that display historical images and stories. Users can point their smartphones at the screens to access additional content, including videos, audio clips, and interactive games. The installation is powered by a combination of solar panels and a network of Wi-Fi-enabled sensors.",
    "A smart bike helmet that features a built-in navigation system, crash detection, and a heads-up display. The helmet includes a small, high-resolution display that provides turn-by-turn directions, speed, and distance information. It also includes a built-in accelerometer that detects potential crashes and sends an alert to emergency services. The helmet is powered by a rechargeable battery that can be charged wirelessly.
