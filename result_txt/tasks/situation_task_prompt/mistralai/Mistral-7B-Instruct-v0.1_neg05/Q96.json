    "If all sand disappeared, I would still enjoy the beach by exploring the other features of the beach such as the water, shells, and rocks. I could go swimming, snorkeling, or diving to see the underwater life. I could also collect shells and rocks to create art pieces or simply appreciate their beauty.",
    "I could try new activities on the beach such as playing beach volleyball, kite-flying, or building sandcastles with other beachgoers. This would give me a chance to socialize and have fun with others.",
    "I could visit other beaches that have different features such as rocky shores, cliffs, or caves. This would give me a chance to explore new environments and learn about the geology of the area.",
    "I could go on a beach walk or hike to discover hidden coves, waterfalls, or other natural wonders. This would give me a chance to exercise and appreciate the beauty of nature.",
    "I could take a beach yoga or meditation class to relax and rejuvenate. This would give me a chance to connect with my body and mind while enjoying the peaceful surroundings of the beach."
