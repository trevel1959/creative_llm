    "**Inertial Sensor Armor**: I envision a suit that incorporates advanced inertial sensors to detect sudden movements or accelerations that could cause harm. When the sensors detect a potentially dangerous motion, the suit's fabric would automatically stiffen or adjust to absorb the impact. This system would require sophisticated material science and could be powered by a small, wearable battery pack. **Confidence Score**: 0.8",
    "**Neural Interface Protection System**: A neural interface that could temporarily shut down or alter brain signals when the body is about to undergo a potentially harmful action. This system could analyze incoming sensory data in real-time and intervene if it predicts an injury, such as by inhibiting reflexes that might lead to self-harm. **Confidence Score**: 0.7",
    "**Biochemical Sensing Suit**: A garment that can detect toxins or harmful chemicals in the environment through microscopic sensors embedded within its fibers. These sensors would trigger an immediate response, such as releasing a protective barrier or alerting the wearer to avoid contact. **Confidence Score**: 0.6",
    "**Magnetic Field Shielding Clothing**: Utilizing magnetic materials to create a protective layer around the body that deflects external forces, such as impacts or electrostatic shocks. This technology would require precise control over the magnetic properties of the materials used. **Confidence Score**: 0.7",
    "**Smart Contact Lenses**: In the eyes, tiny sensors that monitor for signs of potential harm, such as rapid eye movements indicating a possible collision or glare from a bright light that could damage the retina. The lenses would then trigger protective measures, like blink warnings or automatic adjustments to block out harmful stimuli. **Confidence Score**: 0.7"
