    "**Miniature Plant Watering Tool**: If you have small indoor plants, you can use a pen to create a mini watering tool. Remove the ink cartridge, fill the pen body with water, and use the tip to carefully dispense water into the soil of your plants. This method allows for precision watering, preventing over-saturation and ensuring your plants get just the right amount of hydration.",
    "**DIY Sculpture Tool**: Artists can use pens as sculpting tools for clay or other modeling materials. The different shapes and sizes of pen tips can create unique textures and patterns in the clay. Additionally, the pen’s barrel can be used to roll out thin sheets of clay, or the end can be used to poke holes or create indentations for intricate designs.",
    "**Portable Phone Stand**: A pen can be transformed into a makeshift phone stand. By placing the pen horizontally between the phone and a flat surface, you can prop your phone up at an angle for easy viewing while watching videos or participating in video calls. This is especially useful when you don’t have a dedicated phone stand on hand.",
    "**Artistic Stamp Maker**: With a little creativity, you can turn the end of a pen into a stamp. Simply carve a design into the rubber tip of the pen (or use a ballpoint pen with a soft tip), dip it in ink or paint, and stamp it onto paper or fabric. This allows for unique and personalized designs, perfect for card-making or decorating.",
    "**Stress Relief Tool**: A pen can be used as a stress relief tool by employing it for fidgeting. You can roll it between your fingers, click it repeatedly, or even use it to perform simple tricks like spinning it on your fingertips. This can help channel nervous energy or anxiety into a physical activity, making it a handy tool for concentration during meetings or studying."
