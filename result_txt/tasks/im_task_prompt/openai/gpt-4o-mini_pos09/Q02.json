    "**Self-Inflating Tires**:    - Develop tires that can automatically adjust their pressure based on the terrain and rider weight. Using a combination of sensors and a mini-compressor, these tires would monitor the pressure in real-time and inflate or deflate as needed. This would enhance ride comfort and performance, reduce the risk of flats, and eliminate the need for manual tire maintenance.",
    "**Modular Accessory System**:    - Create a modular accessory system that allows riders to easily attach and detach various components such as lights, baskets, phone holders, and speakers. These accessories could snap onto a universal mounting system on the bike frame, allowing for customization based on the rider's needs for different tripsâ€”be it commuting, shopping, or leisure riding.",
    "**Eco-Friendly Biodegradable Frame**:    - Innovate a bicycle frame made from biodegradable materials that still provide durability and strength. This frame could be produced from a combination of natural fibers and bioplastics, allowing for a sustainable option that reduces environmental impact. When the bike reaches the end of its life cycle, the frame could decompose naturally, making it an eco-conscious choice for environmentally aware consumers.",
    "**Adaptive Suspension System**:    - Introduce an adaptive suspension system that automatically adjusts based on the rider's weight, riding style, and terrain. Utilizing sensors and smart technology, the system would analyze conditions in real-time and modify the suspension settings to optimize comfort and control, whether on smooth city streets or rugged trails.",
    "**Integrated Fitness Tracker and Safety System**:    - Design a bicycle that comes equipped with an integrated fitness tracker that monitors the rider's heart rate, calories burned, and distance traveled. Additionally, this system could include safety features such as automatic crash detection that alerts emergency contacts if a severe impact is detected, providing peace of mind for riders and their families."
