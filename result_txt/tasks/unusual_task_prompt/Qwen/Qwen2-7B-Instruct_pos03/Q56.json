    "**360-degree Virtual Reality Video Experience**: Create a camera that can capture a full 360-degree view of its surroundings. This camera could be used in various fields like tourism, real estate, and education. For example, students could use this camera to create virtual field trips, allowing them to experience historical sites or natural wonders from around the world without physically traveling there. This could also be applied in the real estate industry, where potential buyers can virtually tour properties before making a decision.",
    "**Augmented Reality (AR) Camera**: Develop a camera that can overlay digital information onto the real-world scene being captured. This could include superimposing historical data over ancient ruins, showing weather forecasts or traffic conditions over live footage, or even enhancing the user's understanding of the scene by providing additional context through text, graphics, or 3D models. This technology could revolutionize fields such as archaeology, meteorology, and urban planning.",
    "**Self-Cleaning Camera Lens**: Design a camera with a lens that automatically cleans itself using ultrasonic waves or nanotechnology. This would eliminate the need for manual cleaning, which can often lead to scratches and smudges on the lens, affecting image quality. This feature would be especially beneficial for professional photographers and videographers who frequently shoot in challenging environments.",
    "**Smart Camera with Facial Recognition**: Create a camera equipped with facial recognition technology that allows users to identify individuals based on their appearance. This feature could be integrated into security systems to enhance surveillance capabilities, ensuring that only authorized personnel have access to certain areas. It could also be used in social media platforms to suggest connections based on shared interests or mutual friends, improving user engagement and networking opportunities.",
    "**Emotion Detection Camera**: Develop a camera that can detect human emotions through facial expressions and body language. This technology could be used in marketing research to gauge consumer reactions to products or advertisements, helping businesses tailor their strategies accordingly. In healthcare, it could assist in diagnosing mental health conditions by observing subtle changes in patients' emotional responses. Additionally, this could be integrated into educational settings to provide personalized learning experiences based on students' emotional states."
