    "**Solar-Powered Fire-Resistant Coating**: Develop a unique, eco-friendly coating that can be applied to homes to protect them from fire. This coating would be made from a combination of natural and synthetic materials, which would be infused with a fire-resistant compound. The coating would be applied to the exterior of the home, providing a protective barrier against flames and heat. It would also be designed to be solar-powered, harnessing the sun's energy to maintain its effectiveness over time. This coating would be a cost-effective and sustainable solution for protecting homes from fires.",
    "**Fire-Resistant, 3D-Printed Building Envelopes**: Utilize 3D printing technology to create fire-resistant building envelopes that can be applied to homes. These envelopes would be made from a combination of materials, such as ceramic, glass, and metal, which would be arranged in a specific pattern to provide maximum fire resistance. The envelopes would be designed to be modular, allowing them to be easily installed and removed as needed. They would also be equipped with advanced sensors that would detect even the slightest signs of fire, alerting homeowners and emergency services.",
    "**Smart Glass Fire-Blocking Windows**: Develop a type of smart glass that can be installed in windows to block fire from spreading. This glass would be made from a special material that can change its properties in response to heat, turning opaque and blocking flames. The glass would also be equipped with advanced sensors that would detect even the slightest signs of fire, alerting homeowners and emergency services. This technology would be particularly useful for homes with large windows or those in high-risk fire areas.",
    "**Fire-Resistant, Plant-Based Insulation**: Create a type of insulation that is made from plant-based materials, such as bamboo or hemp. This insulation would be designed to be highly effective at preventing heat transfer, while also being non-toxic and biodegradable. It would be installed in the walls and ceiling of homes, providing a fire-resistant barrier against flames and heat. The insulation would also be equipped with advanced sensors that would detect even the slightest signs of fire, alerting homeowners and emergency services.",
    "**Fire-Detection and Suppression System**: Develop an advanced fire-detection and suppression system that can be installed in homes. This system would use advanced sensors and AI-powered algorithms to detect even the slightest signs of fire, alerting homeowners and emergency services. The system would also be equipped with a fire-suppression agent that would be released in the event"
