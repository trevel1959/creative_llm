    "**Self-Cleaning Toothbrush**: Create a toothbrush with built-in UV-C light technology that sanitizes the bristles after each use. The toothbrush would have a charging dock that activates the UV-C light for a few minutes, ensuring that bacteria and germs are eliminated. This would promote better oral hygiene and reduce the risk of infections.",
    "**Eco-Friendly Biodegradable Toothbrush**: Design a toothbrush made from sustainable materials such as bamboo or biodegradable plastics that can break down after disposal. To enhance its appeal, it could feature replaceable heads, allowing users to keep the handle while only replacing the bristle part, reducing plastic waste.",
    "**Toothbrush with Flavor-Infused Bristles**: Innovate a toothbrush that incorporates micro-encapsulated flavoring within the bristles. Each time the user brushes, the flavor is released, providing a refreshing taste experience. This could encourage children and adults alike to brush longer and make oral hygiene more enjoyable.",
    "**Toothbrush with Built-in Timer and Pressure Sensor**: Create a toothbrush that has a built-in timer to ensure users brush for the recommended two minutes. Additionally, it would feature a pressure sensor that alerts users when they are brushing too hard, helping to prevent gum damage and promote healthier brushing habits.",
    "**Travel-Friendly Collapsible Toothbrush**: Design a toothbrush that can collapse into a compact size for easy travel. The handle would fold down, and the bristles would retract or be covered to maintain hygiene. This toothbrush could also come with a portable case that includes a small compartment for toothpaste tablets, making it an ideal companion for travelers."
