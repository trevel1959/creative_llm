    "**Smart Contact Lenses**: Develop smart contact lenses that use artificial intelligence to correct vision problems. These lenses would have sensors that detect the wearer's eye movements and adjust the lens's power accordingly, eliminating the need for manual adjustments. The lenses could also include a small display for notifications or access to relevant information.",
    "**Vision-Assisting Apps**: Create a mobile app that uses the phone's camera and AI to help people with poor vision identify objects, read text, and navigate their environment. The app could be customized with voice commands or gesture-based controls for added convenience.",
    "**Optical Implant**: Develop an optical implant that can be surgically inserted into the eye to correct vision problems. This implant would use micro-electromechanical systems to manipulate the shape of the cornea or the lens, allowing for a permanent and precise correction of vision issues.",
    "**Augmented Reality Glasses**: Design augmented reality glasses that overlay digital information onto the wearer's field of view, enhancing their ability to see and interact with their environment. These glasses could include voice commands, gesture recognition, and real-time translation services to assist people with poor vision in navigating the world.",
    "**Personalized Vision Therapy**: Offer personalized vision therapy sessions to help people with poor vision improve their vision naturally.
