    "**Insect-Repelling Bioplastics**: Create biodegradable plastics infused with natural insect-repelling compounds derived from plants. These bioplastics could be used in packaging, furniture, or even in construction materials. The slow release of the insect-repelling compounds would create a barrier that deters pests while being safe for the environment. This approach could also help reduce plastic waste by providing a sustainable alternative.",
    "**Urban Pest Control Drones**: Implement a fleet of drones equipped with non-toxic insecticides or pheromone traps to monitor and control pest populations in urban areas. These drones could fly over infested regions, identifying hotspots through thermal imaging and deploying targeted treatments. By using drones, pest control can be more precise, reducing the need for widespread chemical applications that could harm other wildlife.",
    "**Pest-Attracting Bio-Scents**: Develop a line of eco-friendly bio-scents that attract pests away from human habitation. These scents could be derived from natural sources that mimic the pheromones of pests, luring them into traps or designated areas where they can be contained or exterminated safely. This method would utilize the pests' own biology against them, minimizing collateral damage to the ecosystem.",
    "**Vertical Farming with Integrated Pest Management**: Encourage the establishment of vertical farms that utilize integrated pest management (IPM) techniques. These farms could be designed with natural barriers and companion planting to create a self-regulating ecosystem. By incorporating plants that repel pests and attract beneficial insects (if any remain), these farms could thrive while keeping pest populations in check.",
    "**Community-Based Pest Control Initiatives**: Launch community programs that educate and empower residents to manage pests sustainably. Workshops could teach people about natural pest deterrents, such as planting certain herbs or using homemade traps. Communities could collaborate to create \"pest patrols,\" where volunteers monitor and address pest issues in public spaces, fostering a sense of collective responsibility."
