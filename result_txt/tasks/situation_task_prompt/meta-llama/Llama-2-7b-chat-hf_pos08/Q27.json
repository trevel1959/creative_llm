    "Use passive solar design: Buildings with passive solar design can utilize natural sunlight and heat during the day to warm up, and then use natural ventilation and insulation to keep the temperature stable at night. This can be achieved by strategically placing windows, skylights, and thermal mass materials like concrete or brick.",
    "Employ phase-change materials: Phase-change materials (PCMs) are substances that can absorb and release heat energy as they change phase from solid to liquid or vice versa. These materials can be integrated into building components like walls, floors, or ceilings to help regulate indoor temperature. For example, a PCM-based wall could absorb heat during the day and release it at night, maintaining a stable temperature.",
    "Utilize evaporative cooling: Evaporative cooling systems use water to cool the air, which can be an effective and energy-efficient alternative to traditional air conditioning. By incorporating evaporative cooling systems into building design, such as whole-house evaporative cooling or window-mounted evaporative coolers, indoor temperature can be regulated without relying on electricity.",
    "Leverage greenhouses: Greenhouses can provide a natural and sustainable way to regulate indoor temperature by utilizing the natural heating and cooling properties of plants. By incorporating greenhouses into building design, the indoor temperature can be moderated through the transfer of heat from plants, and the greenhouse effect can also provide natural lighting and ventilation.",
    "Develop a thermal battery: A thermal battery is a device that stores thermal energy in the form of molten salt or other phase-change materials. By incorporating a thermal battery into building design, the stored thermal energy can be used to regulate indoor temperature, providing a reliable and sustainable alternative to traditional heating and cooling systems. As the battery charges and discharges, it can help maintain a stable indoor temperature, even during periods of extreme weather."
