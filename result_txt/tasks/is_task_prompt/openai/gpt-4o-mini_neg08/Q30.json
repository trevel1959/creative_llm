    "Once upon a time, in a kingdom high above the clouds, there lived a dragon named Ember. Unlike his fiery kin, Ember was terrified of fire. While others soared through the skies, breathing flames, he hid in caves, avoiding the sun's warm rays. One fateful day, a fierce storm threatened his home, igniting the forest below. As the flames spread, Ember felt an unfamiliar urge. Gathering his courage, he soared into the inferno, using his wings to fan the flames away from the village. To his surprise, he discovered that he could control fire, becoming a hero. From that day on, Ember embraced his true nature, finding strength in his fears.",
