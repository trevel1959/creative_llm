    "**Self-Cleaning Hairbrush**: Design a hairbrush that features a self-cleaning mechanism. The bristles could be made from a special material that repels hair and dirt. Additionally, the brush could have a built-in UV light that sanitizes the bristles after each use, ensuring hygiene and reducing the need for manual cleaning.",
    "**Modular Brush System**: Create a hairbrush with interchangeable heads for different hair types and styles. Users could easily switch between a detangling head, a smoothing head, or a volumizing head depending on their needs. This modular design would cater to diverse hair textures and styling preferences, making it a versatile tool.",
    "**Thermal Hairbrush**: Introduce a hairbrush that incorporates a gentle heating element. This would allow users to style their hair while brushing, similar to a flat iron or curling wand. The brush could have adjustable temperature settings and a safety feature that turns off after a certain period, providing a convenient way to achieve sleek or curled looks without additional tools.",
    "**Eco-Friendly Hairbrush**: Develop a hairbrush made entirely from sustainable materials, such as bamboo or recycled plastics. Additionally, the brush could feature biodegradable bristles and a refillable handle. This eco-friendly approach would appeal to environmentally conscious consumers and promote sustainable beauty practices.",
    "**Built-in Hair Care Dispenser**: Create a hairbrush with a compartment that dispenses hair care products like leave-in conditioner or detangler as you brush. Users could fill the compartment with their preferred product, and the brush would release a fine mist or gel onto the hair, allowing for easier application and ensuring even distribution."
