    "\"The Weight of Memories\": Create a series of illustrations that depict a suitcase filled with various objects, each one representing a different memory from the owner's past. The objects could be anything from old photographs and ticket stubs to sentimental trinkets and heirlooms. The illustrations could be presented in a way that creates a sense of nostalgia and longing, highlighting the idea that the memories we hold onto are what make us who we are.",
    "\"The Adventure Awaits\": Design a suitcase that doubles as a travel journal. The suitcase could have a built-in compartment for storing travel tickets, maps, and other mementos from each destination. The exterior of the suitcase could feature a world map or a globe, with stickers or markers for marking off the places you've been. This would encourage people to use the suitcase as a way to document their travels and plan their next adventure.",
    "\"The Lost and Found\": Create a suitcase that has a hidden compartment for storing small items that you might lose during travel, such as keys, phones, or sunglasses. The compartment could be accessed through a secret panel or a hidden zipper, adding an element of mystery and excitement to the suitcase. This would be especially useful for people who are prone to misplacing things while traveling.",
    "\"The Time Capsule\": Design a suitcase that can be used as a time capsule. The suitcase could be filled with items that are relevant to the current time period, such as newspapers, coins, and other objects that will be of interest to future generations. The suitcase could also have a built-in clock or timer that counts down the time until it is opened, adding an element of anticipation and excitement to the concept.",
    "\"The Magic Briefcase\": Create a suitcase that has a hidden compartment that can only be accessed by performing a specific magical gesture or phrase. The compartment could contain surprises such as a deck of magic cards, a magic wand, or a treasure chest filled with surprises. This would add an element of fun and excitement to the suitcase, making it a unique and memorable experience for the owner."
