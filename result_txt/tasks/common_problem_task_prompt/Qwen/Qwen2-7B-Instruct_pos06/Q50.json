    "**Green Infrastructure Integration**: Develop a community that seamlessly integrates green infrastructure such as rain gardens, bioswales, and permeable pavements to manage stormwater effectively. These features not only help in reducing runoff but also provide habitats for local wildlife, enhancing biodiversity. The confidence score for this idea is 0.95.",
    "**Vertical Farming**: Implement vertical farming techniques within the community, using indoor hydroponic systems or vertical gardens on building facades. This approach maximizes space while producing fresh, locally-sourced food. It reduces transportation-related emissions and supports self-sufficiency. The confidence score for this idea is 0.93.",
    "**Renewable Energy Solutions**: Incorporate solar panels, wind turbines, and geothermal heating and cooling systems to generate clean energy. Establish partnerships with local utilities to ensure the community can sell excess power back into the grid. This initiative can significantly reduce carbon footprint and lower energy costs. The confidence score for this idea is 0.97.",
    "**Smart Home Technologies**: Equip homes with smart devices that optimize energy usage, such as smart thermostats, LED lighting, and efficient appliances. Integrate these systems with a central management platform to monitor and adjust consumption based on real-time data. This approach promotes sustainable living habits among residents. The confidence score for this idea is 0.96.",
    "**Community-Supported Agriculture (CSA) and Composting**: Establish a CSA program where residents can subscribe to receive fresh produce directly from local farmers. Implement composting facilities to recycle organic waste from households and farms, turning it into nutrient-rich soil for gardening. This creates a closed-loop system that minimizes waste and supports local agriculture. The confidence score for this idea is 0.94."
