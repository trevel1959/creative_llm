    "Eco-Friendly Sustainable Energy: Steering wheels could be used to generate sustainable energy by harnessing the energy produced while turning the wheel. By connecting the wheel to a small turbine and a battery pack, the kinetic energy generated from spinning the wheel could be converted into electricity.",
