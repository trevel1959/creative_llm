    "**Personalized Voice Alarm**: Instead of a generic beep or chime, allow users to record their own voice or the voice of a loved one to wake them up. This could create a more comforting wake-up experience. Additionally, the clock could have a feature where it plays motivational quotes or affirmations after the alarm goes off, setting a positive tone for the day.",
    "**Smart Sleep Analysis**: Integrate a sleep tracking feature that monitors the userâ€™s sleep patterns through movement and sound. The clock could analyze this data and provide personalized insights, such as the best time to wake up based on the user's sleep cycle, ensuring they wake up during a light sleep phase for a more refreshing start to the day.",
    "**Interactive Alarm**: Design an alarm clock that requires users to complete a simple task to turn it off, such as solving a puzzle, doing a short math problem, or even taking a picture of a specific object in the room. This would help ensure that users are awake and alert when they finally get out of bed.",
    "**Aromatherapy Integration**: Add an essential oil diffuser feature that releases calming scents like lavender or invigorating scents like citrus at the time of the alarm. This could enhance the waking experience by using aromatherapy to stimulate the senses and create a more pleasant environment.",
    "**Wake-Up Playlist Creator**: Create a clock that syncs with music streaming services to allow users to build personalized wake-up playlists. Users could select their favorite songs or genres, and the clock could gradually increase the volume to help them wake up to music that energizes them rather than a jarring alarm sound."
