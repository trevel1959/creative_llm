    "**Enhanced Braille and Tactile Graphics**: This innovative idea involves developing more advanced forms of tactile graphics for individuals with poor vision. The tactile graphics could be enhanced to provide more detailed information about their surroundings. For example, maps could have a raised texture that indicates streets, buildings, and landmarks. Books and other documents could also have tactile pages where the text is embossed in various depths, allowing readers to feel the letters and words. ",
    "**Improved Sound Navigation Systems**: With the absence of glasses and contact lenses, people would need new methods to navigate effectively. One creative solution could be the development of sound navigation systems that can convert visual information into sound cues. For instance, a system could use ultrasonic sensors to detect obstacles and create aural representations of their location, distance, and size. This could help users to safely navigate through their environment without relying on sight.",
    "**Advanced Sensory Training and Adaptation Programs**: This approach focuses on enhancing other senses to compensate for the lack of visual aids. Sensory training programs could teach individuals how to interpret sounds, touch, and other sensory inputs more effectively. For example, they might learn to identify objects by their texture, smell, or temperature, and use this information to navigate and interact with their environment. Additionally, they could undergo physical training to improve their spatial awareness and balance, which would aid in everyday tasks like walking or driving.",
    "**Innovative Text-to-Speech Software**: With the disappearance of glasses and contact lenses, text-based information would need to be accessed differently. The development of highly advanced text-to-speech software could revolutionize how people with poor vision consume written content. These programs could not only read out loud but also add context, highlight important points, and even predict what comes next based on the userâ€™s reading habits. This would significantly enhance comprehension and reduce the effort required to understand complex texts.",
    "**Sensory-Friendly Environments and Apps**: Creating environments and digital tools that cater specifically to individuals with poor vision would be another innovative solution. For instance, apps could be designed to adjust lighting, contrast, and color schemes to make visual information more accessible. Sensory-friendly spaces could incorporate elements like ambient lighting, soothing music, and tactile materials to guide and comfort users. These environments would aim to make daily activities easier and less stressful for those who rely heavily on visual cues."
