    "**Aquatic Architecture**: Buildings and homes would be designed with a focus on fluid dynamics and pressure resistance. Windows would be replaced with bioluminescent panels, and walls would be made of a lightweight, yet incredibly strong, coral-like material. The structures would be shaped like sea creatures, such as jellyfish or sea turtles, to maximize stability and minimize drag.",
    "**Eco-Friendly Energy**: Underwater, the primary source of energy would be tidal and wave power. Harnessing the kinetic energy of ocean currents and waves would provide a clean and sustainable source of electricity. This energy would power the underwater city, reducing the need for fossil fuels and minimizing the city's carbon footprint.",
    "**Aquatic Agriculture**: The underwater city would employ innovative methods for food production, such as hydroponics and aquaculture. Fish and other sea creatures would be raised in controlled environments, and crops would be grown using nutrient-rich seawater. This would not only provide a sustainable food source but also create a closed-loop ecosystem.",
    "**Advanced Transportation**: Underwater transportation would be revolutionized with the use of advanced magnetic levitation technology and high-speed electric propulsion. This would enable fast and efficient travel between different parts of the city, as well as to the surface. The transportation system would also incorporate advanced navigation and communication systems.",
    "**Underwater Exploration**: The underwater city would be a hub for scientific research and exploration. Advanced submersibles and underwater robots would be used to explore the ocean's depths, discovering new species and ecosystems. The city would also serve as a base for underwater archaeological expeditions, uncovering the secrets of ancient civilizations that once thrived in the ocean.
