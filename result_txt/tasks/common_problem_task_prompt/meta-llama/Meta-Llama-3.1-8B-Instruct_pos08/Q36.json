    "**Solar City Initiative**: Implement a city-wide solar panel installation program, where residents can opt-in to have solar panels installed on their rooftops. The city can offer incentives such as reduced electricity bills, tax credits, and community recognition to encourage participation. To make it more accessible, the city can also offer financing options and partnerships with local solar companies.",
    "**Community Solar Gardens**: Create community solar gardens where multiple residents can share the benefits of solar energy. This can be achieved by installing solar panels on a large plot of land and allocating the generated electricity to participating residents. This model can be especially beneficial for low-income households or those with limited roof space.",
    "**Solar-Powered Public Spaces**: Transform public spaces such as parks, plazas, and streetlights into solar-powered hubs. This can not only reduce the city's carbon footprint but also create a visually appealing and eco-friendly atmosphere. The generated electricity can be used to power public facilities, lighting, and other amenities.",
    "**Solar Panel Leasing Program**: Introduce a leasing program that allows residents to rent solar panels for their homes. This can be a cost-effective option for those who cannot afford the upfront cost of purchasing solar panels. The leasing company can maintain and repair the panels, ensuring a hassle-free experience for the residents.",
    "**Solar Energy Cooperatives**: Establish solar energy cooperatives, where residents can pool their resources to purchase and maintain solar panels. This model promotes community engagement, education, and collective ownership, making solar energy more accessible and affordable for everyone. Members can share the benefits of solar energy, such as reduced electricity bills and increased property value.
