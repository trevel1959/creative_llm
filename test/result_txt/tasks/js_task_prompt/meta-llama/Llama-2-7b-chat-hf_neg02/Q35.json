    "Woolly Mammoth - I would bring back the Woolly Mammoth because they were intelligent, social creatures that were well adapted to their environment. They were also herbivores, which means they wouldn't pose a threat to human populations like some other extinct animals. With their thick fur and cold-adapted physiology, they could thrive in today's Arctic regions, providing a unique opportunity for scientists to study their behavior and ecology.",
    "Quagga - I would choose the Quagga, a subspecies of zebra that went extinct in the late 19th century due to overhunting. Quaggas were known for their distinctive stripes, which had a distinctive \"Z\" shape on their backs. By bringing them back, we could learn more about their social behavior, habitat preferences, and how they interacted with other species in their ecosystem.",
    "Passenger Pigeon - The Passenger Pigeon was once the most abundant bird species in North America, with an estimated population of 3 billion to 5 billion individuals. However, their population declined rapidly due to overhunting and habitat loss, leading to their extinction in 1914. By bringing back the Passenger Pigeon, we could study their ecological role in their former habitats and how their reintroduction could impact other species.",
    "Thylacine - The Thylacine, also known as the Tasmanian Tiger, was a carnivorous marsupial that went extinct in the early 20th century due to hunting and disease. They were known for their distinctive stripes and powerful jaws, which made them a formidable predator. By bringing back the Thylacine, we could learn more about their behavior, ecology, and how they interacted with other species in their ecosystem.",
    "Moa - The Moa was a large flightless bird that went extinct in New Zealand around 1500 AD due to overhunting by humans. There were several species of Moa, ranging in size from 2 to 3 meters tall and weighing up to 230 kg. By bringing back the Moa, we could study their ecological role in their former habitats and"
