    "**Language Barriers**: Communication may be challenging if the student’s proficiency in the host family's language is limited. This could lead to misunderstandings and frustration. To address this, the host family could implement a “language buddy” system, pairing the student with a family member who can help with language practice through casual conversation and daily activities.",
    "**Different Dietary Needs**: The exchange student may have different dietary restrictions or preferences based on their cultural background, which could create tension during meal times. To solve this, the host family could involve the student in meal planning, allowing them to share their favorite dishes and learn about local cuisine, thus promoting inclusivity and appreciation for diversity.",
    "**Educational System Differences**: The foreign exchange student may find the educational system in the host country to be vastly different, leading to academic struggles. The host family could arrange regular check-ins with the student’s teachers and offer tutoring support to help them navigate the new academic landscape and feel more confident in their studies.",
    "**Social Integration Challenges**: The student might have difficulty making friends or fitting in with their peers, which can lead to loneliness. The host family could organize social outings, such as game nights or trips to local attractions, and encourage the student to join clubs or sports teams at school to help them build a social network.",
    "**Family Dynamics Disruption**: The introduction of a new family member can disrupt existing family dynamics, leading to potential conflicts or misunderstandings. To prevent this, the host family should establish clear communication and expectations from the outset, creating a family agreement that outlines shared responsibilities and house rules to ensure everyone feels comfortable and valued."
