    "**Supply Chain Disruptions**: A major concern for any new fashion line is the potential for supply chain disruptions, such as supplier delays, quality issues, or even sourcing raw materials. Ensuring robust relationships with suppliers, maintaining a diverse supplier base, and having contingency plans in place can mitigate these risks.",
    "**Intellectual Property Conflicts**: Another issue could involve intellectual property rights, where the new fashion line might inadvertently infringe on existing designs or trademarks. Thorough legal checks, including patent searches and trademark validations, are necessary to prevent costly legal disputes.",
    "**Fashion Industry Competition**: The fashion industry is highly competitive, and standing out requires unique design concepts and effective marketing strategies. Failing to differentiate from established brands could result in poor market penetration and low sales. Developing a clear brand identity, unique selling propositions, and innovative marketing campaigns are key.",

Implementing sustainable practices like using eco-friendly materials, reducing waste, and adopting ethical labor practices is crucial to appeal to this segment of the market.",
    "**E-commerce Integration**: For a successful launch, integrating an e-commerce platform is essential. However, technical issues, cybersecurity threats, and managing online reviews can pose significant challenges. Ensuring a user-friendly website, robust IT infrastructure, and responsive customer service are vital components for a smooth online shopping experience."
