    "Floating City: Create a sustainable living community on a series of interconnected floating islands in the ocean. These islands can be made of recycled materials, such as old shipping containers, and can be powered by renewable energy sources like solar, wind, and hydroelectric power. The community can be designed to accommodate various types of housing, including apartments, single-family homes, and communal living spaces. The unique oceanfront location can also provide opportunities for aquaculture, seaweed farming, and other marine-based industries.",
    "Vertical Forest City: Design a sustainable living community that is integrated into a towering vertical forest. The community can be built on multiple levels of a tall tree-covered structure, with each level featuring a mix of housing, community spaces, and green spaces. The trees can provide natural insulation, reduce air pollution, and create a peaceful living environment. The community can also incorporate green roofs, living walls, and other sustainable features to minimize its ecological footprint.",
    "Bamboo Eco-Village: Create a sustainable living community that is centered around a bamboo-based economy. The community can be built using locally-sourced bamboo, which can be used for construction, furniture, and other everyday needs. The community can also incorporate permaculture principles, with gardens, orchards, and other food production areas integrated into the design. Renewable energy sources like solar and wind power can be used to power the community, and waste management systems can be implemented to minimize waste and promote recycling.",
    "Underground Living: Design a sustainable living community that is built underground. The community can be constructed using natural tunnels or caves, which can be adapted for housing, community spaces, and other needs. The underground location can provide natural insulation, reduce the community's ecological footprint, and protect it from natural disasters. The community can also incorporate sustainable features like geothermal heating and cooling, and wastewater treatment systems.",
    "Water-Based Community: Create a sustainable living community that is built on a series of interconnected floating platforms in a lake or river. The community can be powered by"
