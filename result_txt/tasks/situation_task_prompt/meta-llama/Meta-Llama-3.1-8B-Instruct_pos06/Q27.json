    "**Thermal Window Insulation System**: Develop a dynamic window insulation system that can change its opacity and reflectivity in response to changing temperatures. During the day, the windows would be transparent to allow sunlight to enter and warm the space. At night, they would become opaque to retain the heat. This system would be powered by a small, low-maintenance, and energy-efficient motor. Confidence score: 0.8",
    "**Passive Radiative Cooling**: Implement a passive radiative cooling system that uses a combination of materials with high thermal mass, such as concrete or brick, and reflective surfaces to radiate excess heat away from the building. This system would be especially effective in areas with high solar radiation. Confidence score: 0.9",
    "**Phase Change Materials (PCMs)**: Integrate phase change materials into building insulation to absorb and release heat as the temperature changes. PCMs would help regulate the indoor temperature by releasing heat during the night and absorbing heat during the day. Confidence score: 0.85",
    "**Evaporative Cooling System**: Design an evaporative cooling system that uses water evaporation to cool the air. This system would be more efficient than traditional air conditioning systems and would not rely on electricity. Confidence score: 0.8",
    "**Green Roof and Walls**: Implement a green roof and walls system that uses vegetation to regulate the indoor temperature. The plants would absorb carbon dioxide and release oxygen, while also providing insulation and shading. Confidence score: 0.9"
