    "In a vibrant forest, a young unicorn named Lila roamed, but unlike her kin, she was born without a horn. The other unicorns shunned her, calling her “the ordinary horse.” Feeling lost, Lila wandered into the Whispering Woods, where she discovered a hidden glade filled with shimmering flowers. Each petal whispered secrets of the forest. Inspired, Lila began to share these stories with the other creatures, weaving tales of adventure and wonder. One day, a storm threatened the forest, and only Lila’s knowledge could save them. When she led them to safety, the unicorns realized her true magic lay within her heart, not her horn.",
