    "Using only natural resources: Find edible plants in your area and learn to identify them. You can use leaves, stems, fruits, and roots to make a simple dish like a salad or soup. Additionally, you can use rocks to cook food over an open fire, as they are conductive and heat up quickly.",
    "Cooking on a stove top: If you have access to a stove top, you can use a pot or pan to cook food. Simply fill the pot with water and bring it to a boil, then add your ingredients and let them cook for a few minutes.",
    "Using technology: There are several apps available that can help you identify edible plants and suggest recipes based on what you have available. You can also use online resources to find recipes that don't require any cooking equipment.",
    "Building a primitive oven: If you have some time and materials, you can build a primitive oven using rocks and clay. This will allow you to cook food at higher temperatures than simply cooking over an open fire.",
    "Cooking with fire: If you have access to a fire, you can use it to cook food. Start by building a fire and placing your food on hot coals. Cook the food until it is done, being careful not to burn it. You can also use rocks to create a hearth for your fire and place your food on top of them to cook."
