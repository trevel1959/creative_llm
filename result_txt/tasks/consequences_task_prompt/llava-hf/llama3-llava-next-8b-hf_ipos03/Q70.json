    "Impacts on Technology: The reduction in the speed of light would have a profound impact on the technology that relies on it, such as fiber optics, GPS, and satellite communication. These systems would need to be reengineered to accommodate the slower speed of light.",
    "Changes in Energy Use: With slower light, energy consumption would increase as devices would need to use more power to compensate for the reduced speed of light, leading to higher energy costs and environmental impact.",
    "Repercussions on Transportation: The reduced speed of light would have a significant impact on transportation systems, particularly those that rely on light-based signals. This would include traffic lights, train signaling, and air traffic control.",
    "Shifts in the Global Economy: The reduced speed of light would disrupt global trade and commerce, as it would take longer for information to travel across the globe, leading to delays in decision-making and supply chain disruptions.",
    "Impact on Scientific Research: Scientific research would be severely impacted by the reduced speed of light, as experiments that rely on light-based signals would be much slower, leading to a decrease in the pace of scientific discovery."
