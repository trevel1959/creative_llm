    "**Interactive Story Lampshade**: Create a lampshade that doubles as an interactive storytelling device for children or adults who love bedtime stories. The inside of the lampshade can contain small cards or strips of paper with story elements (characters, settings, events) printed on them. By rotating these elements around the light source, different stories can be created each night. The lampshade can also have a simple switch that changes the brightness, representing day and night in the story.",
    "**Scented Lampshade**: Develop a lampshade with built-in scent diffusers. Inside the lampshade, there could be compartments containing small scented candles or essential oil pads. As the lamp is turned on, the heat from the bulb gently diffuses the scent throughout the room, creating a pleasant ambiance. Different designs and fragrances can be offered to suit various moods or occasions.",
    "**Customizable Art Lampshade**: Offer a lampshade design where customers can personalize the fabric covering. Using a digital interface, users can select from a variety of pre-made patterns, upload their own images, or even create custom designs using a drawing tool provided. This allows for endless customization possibilities, turning a simple lampshade into a unique piece of art that reflects personal tastes.",
    "**Smart Lampshade with Mood Lighting**: Incorporate smart technology into the lampshade, allowing it to adjust its color temperature based on the time of day or user preference. For example, warmer colors can be used during the evening to promote relaxation, while cooler colors might be more suitable for daytime activities. Users can control the shade through a smartphone app, adjusting the lighting according to their mood or the activity taking place in the room.",
    "**Educational Lampshade for Children**: Design a lampshade that serves as an educational tool for children learning about the solar system. The fabric or paper covering can be printed with images of planets and stars, and the inside of the lampshade can contain small, illuminated labels describing each celestial body. As the lamp is turned on, the lights can highlight each planet in turn, teaching children about astronomy in a fun and engaging way."
