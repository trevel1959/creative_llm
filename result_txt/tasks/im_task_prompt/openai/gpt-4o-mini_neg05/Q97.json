    "**Built-in Poop Bag Dispenser**: This leash could feature a discreet compartment that holds biodegradable poop bags, making it convenient for dog owners to clean up after their pets. The design would ensure easy access without compromising the aesthetics of the leash, and it could even include a small flashlight for nighttime walks.",
    "**Reflective and Illuminated Safety Features**: To enhance safety during nighttime walks, the leash could incorporate reflective materials and built-in LED lights. The lights could be set to different modes, such as steady, flashing, or strobe, making the dog and owner visible to cars and other pedestrians.",
    "**Multi-Functional Leash with Training Features**: This leash could come with built-in training features, such as a clicker for positive reinforcement, a treat pouch, and a whistle for commands. This would make it easier for dog owners to train their pets on the go, ensuring that they have all the necessary tools at their fingertips.",
    "**Ergonomic Handle with Comfort Grip**: The handle of the leash could be designed with ergonomics in mind, featuring a soft, cushioned grip that reduces strain on the owner's hand during long walks.
