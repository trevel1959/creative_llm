    "Floating Island Oasis: Create a buoyant structure using a combination of natural and synthetic materials, such as palm fronds, bamboo, and plastic bottles, to create a floating island that can provide shelter and protection from the elements. This structure can be anchored to the ocean floor or left adrift, depending on the location and conditions.",
    "Solar-Powered Hydroponic Garden: Build a hydroponic garden using a combination of solar panels and a water filtration system to create a sustainable food source. This system can be powered by the sun, allowing for a continuous supply of fresh produce, including fruits, vegetables, and herbs.",
    "Deserted Island University: Establish a makeshift university on the island, offering courses in survival skills, marine biology, and island ecology. This can be achieved by utilizing available resources, such as driftwood for building materials and seaweed for crafting tools and materials.",
    "Water Harvesting and Purification System: Develop a system that collects and purifies rainwater, seawater, and even saltwater from the air to create a reliable source of fresh water. This can be achieved through the use of membrane filtration, reverse osmosis, and other water purification technologies.",
    "Sustainable Transportation: Create a unique form of transportation that harnesses the power of the ocean currents, waves, or tides to travel between islands or to nearby coastal areas. This could involve constructing a hydrofoil, a sailboat with a solar-powered motor, or even a man-made island that can be towed to different locations."
