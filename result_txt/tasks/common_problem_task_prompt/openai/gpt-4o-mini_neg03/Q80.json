    "**Sustainable Catering**: Sourcing catering that emphasizes local, organic, and seasonal ingredients can be difficult, especially if the wedding is held in an area where such options are limited. Additionally, traditional catering often relies on single-use plastics and non-biodegradable materials. Couples can mitigate this by partnering with caterers who specialize in farm-to-table dining, offering plant-based menus, and utilizing reusable or compostable dishware.",
    "**Transportation Logistics**: Ensuring that guests have eco-friendly transportation options can be a logistical nightmare. If the venue is remote or public transportation is lacking, guests may resort to driving individually, increasing carbon footprints. To solve this, couples can arrange shuttle services using electric or hybrid vehicles, encourage carpooling, or provide information about public transport options.",
    "**Invitations and Paper Waste**: Traditional wedding invitations can lead to significant paper waste, and many couples overlook the environmental impact of their choices. To combat this, couples can opt for digital invitations, or if they prefer printed ones, choose recycled paper or seed paper that can be planted afterward. This not only reduces waste but also adds a unique touch to the wedding.",
    "**Floral Arrangements**: Many wedding flowers are imported from far-flung places, contributing to carbon emissions. Additionally, cut flowers often end up in landfills. Couples can address this by selecting locally grown flowers, using potted plants that can be replanted, or opting for dried flowers that can be reused or repurposed after the event.",
    "**Wedding Favors**: Many traditional wedding favors are either unnecessary or end up being discarded, contributing to waste. Couples can choose eco-friendly alternatives such as edible favors, seed packets, or handmade items from local artisans. This not only supports local businesses but also ensures that guests leave with something meaningful and sustainable."
