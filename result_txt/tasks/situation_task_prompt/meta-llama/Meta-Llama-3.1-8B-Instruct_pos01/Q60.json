    "**Bartering Ecosystem**: Establish a global network of bartering platforms, where individuals and businesses can exchange goods and services without using traditional currency. This can be facilitated through online marketplaces, mobile apps, or even community-driven bulletin boards. For example, a farmer could offer fresh produce in exchange for a carpenter's services to build a new greenhouse. (Confidence score: 0.8)",
    "**Time-Based Currency**: Introduce a new form of currency based on time, where individuals can earn and spend time credits. This can be done by creating a global time-banking system, where people can exchange hours of work or skills for other people's time credits. For instance, a teacher could earn time credits by teaching a class and then use those credits to pay for a massage therapist's services. (Confidence score: 0.7)",
    "**Resource-Based Economy**: Shift towards a resource-based economy, where goods and services are exchanged based on the availability of resources, rather than traditional currency. This can be achieved by creating a global database of available resources, such as food, water, energy, and materials, and allowing individuals to access and exchange these resources based on need. For example, a community could share excess food from a local farm to feed those in need. (Confidence score: 0.9)",
    "**Skill-Based Exchange**: Develop a system where individuals can exchange skills and expertise directly, without the need for traditional currency. This can be facilitated through online platforms, workshops, or community events, where people can learn and teach new skills in exchange for other skills or services. For instance, a software developer could teach a coding class in exchange for a yoga instructor's services. (Confidence score: 0.8)",
    "**Local Exchange Systems**: Implement a network of local exchange systems, where communities can trade goods and services within their own regions. This can be done through community-driven initiatives, such as local currencies, time banks, or skill-sharing programs. For example, a neighborhood could create a local currency, where residents can exchange goods and services within their community. (Confidence score: 0.7)"
