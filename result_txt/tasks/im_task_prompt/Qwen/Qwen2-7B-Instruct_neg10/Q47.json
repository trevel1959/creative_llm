    "Multi-surface Cleaning System: Create a modular attachment system that allows the vacuum cleaner to easily switch between different cleaning heads designed for various surfaces (carpets, hard floors, upholstery, etc.). This would expand the vacuum's functionality and make it more versatile for different household needs.",
    "Interactive User Interface: Integrate a touch screen or voice-activated controls on the vacuum cleaner to allow users to customize cleaning settings, set schedules, and receive feedback on cleaning performance. This could also include features like real-time dust level monitoring and alerts for maintenance checks.",
    "Eco-friendly Design: Develop a vacuum cleaner that utilizes renewable energy sources, such as solar panels or kinetic energy from the cleaning process itself, to power its operation. Additionally, focus on using sustainable materials in its construction and consider incorporating features like air filtration systems that trap harmful pollutants while cleaning.",
    "Personalized Cleaning Experience: Use facial recognition technology to identify family members and adjust the vacuum cleaner's cleaning intensity based on each person's preferences. For example, children might require a gentler cleaning mode, while adults may prefer a more thorough clean.",
    "Social Media Integration: Create a version of the vacuum cleaner that connects to social media platforms, allowing users to share their cleaning achievements, connect with friends for cleaning tips, and participate in virtual challenges or competitions. This could also include features like automatic posting of before-and-after photos or videos of cleaned areas."
