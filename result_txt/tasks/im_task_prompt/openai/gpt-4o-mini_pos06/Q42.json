    "**Expandable and Modular Design**:    Create a suitcase with a modular design that allows users to expand or reduce its size based on their travel needs. This could be achieved through zippers or expandable compartments that can be added or removed. For example, a user could attach an additional compartment for a weekend trip and detach it for a short business trip.",
    "**Built-in Charging Station and Solar Panels**:    Equip the suitcase with a built-in power bank that can charge multiple devices simultaneously, such as phones, tablets, and laptops. Incorporate solar panels on the exterior of the suitcase to allow for charging while on the go, providing travelers with a sustainable energy source during their journeys.",
    "**Self-Weighing Mechanism**:    Introduce a suitcase that automatically weighs itself and provides a digital readout on the handle or through a mobile app. This feature would help travelers avoid overweight baggage fees and make packing more efficient. The suitcase could also offer suggestions for redistributing weight based on the contents.",
    "**Personalized Security Features**:    Enhance suitcase security with biometric locks that use fingerprint recognition or facial recognition technology. This feature would provide a higher level of security, allowing only the owner to unlock the suitcase. Additionally, an alarm system could be integrated to alert users if someone attempts to tamper with it.",
    "**Interactive Interior with Smart Organization**:    Design an interior layout that incorporates smart organization features, such as customizable dividers that can be adjusted based on the items being packed. The suitcase could include an app that scans and organizes the contents, providing reminders for packing essentials and helping users keep track of what they have packed."
