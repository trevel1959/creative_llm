    "**Liability and Insurance Complications**: With the introduction of self-driving cars, the question of liability in the event of an accident becomes complex. If a self-driving car is involved in a collision, determining whether the manufacturer, software developer, or the car owner is liable could lead to legal disputes. Additionally, insurance policies may need to be restructured to accommodate these new types of vehicles, leading to confusion for consumers and insurance companies alike.",
    "**Ethical Dilemmas in Programming**: Self-driving cars must be programmed to make split-second decisions in emergency situations, which raises ethical questions. For instance, if a collision is unavoidable, should the car prioritize the safety of its passengers over pedestrians? These moral dilemmas complicate the programming of self-driving algorithms and could lead to public distrust if not addressed transparently.",
    "**Infrastructure Compatibility**: Many cities and towns may not have the infrastructure in place to support self-driving cars effectively. This includes the need for smart traffic signals, dedicated lanes, and clear signage. If the existing infrastructure is not compatible with autonomous technology, it could lead to inefficient traffic flow, increased congestion, and safety issues as self-driving cars navigate unpredictable environments.",
    "**Public Acceptance and Trust**: There may be significant public skepticism regarding the safety and reliability of self-driving cars. Incidents involving autonomous vehicles, whether due to software glitches or accidents, could lead to negative media coverage and a loss of consumer confidence. Building trust in this technology will require extensive testing, transparency, and education about its benefits and safety features.",
    "**Job Displacement in the Transportation Sector**: The widespread adoption of self-driving cars could lead to job losses in industries reliant on human drivers, such as trucking, taxi services, and delivery services. This displacement may create economic challenges and necessitate retraining programs for affected workers to transition into new roles in an increasingly automated workforce."
