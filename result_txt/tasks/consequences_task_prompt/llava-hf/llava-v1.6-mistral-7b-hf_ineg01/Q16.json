    "A decrease in food sources: Many animals rely on insects as a primary food source. Without insects, these animals would have to find alternative sources of food, which could lead to competition with humans for resources like fruits, nuts, and seeds.",
    "A decline in ecosystem services: Insects play a crucial role in maintaining the balance of ecosystems. For example, they help with decomposition, pollination, and nutrient cycling. The loss of insects could disrupt these processes and have a cascading effect on the entire ecosystem.",
    "A rise in pest populations: Insects are a natural control on many pest populations. Without insects, pests like rodents and weeds could become more prevalent, leading to increased damage to crops and forests.",
    "A decline in soil health: Many insects help with nutrient cycling by breaking down organic matter in the soil. Without insects, the soil could become less fertile, leading to a decline in crop yields and overall soil health.",
    "A loss of cultural and economic value: Insects are an important part of many cultures and economies. For example, honey production relies on bees, and many traditional medicines are derived from insects. The loss of insects could have a significant impact on these industries."
