    "-hopping:-hopping is a technique used by the indigenous people of some Pacific islands to travel across the ocean. It involves paddling out to sea on a small wooden board, called a \"forest,\" and then jumping from one forest to the next, using the momentum of the current to travel further.",
    "-sailing: similar to the technique of forest-hopping, this involves using small wooden boards to sail across the ocean. The boards are connected by ropes, and the sailor uses a long paddle to propel the group across the water.",
    "water-skiing: using water skis and a boat as a tow vehicle, the sailor can travel across the ocean at high speeds. The boat can be controlled using a joystick or steering wheel, and the sailor can adjust their speed and direction by shifting their weight on the skis.",
    "jet skiing: similar to water skiing, jet skiing involves using a high-powered jet ski to travel across the ocean. The jet ski can be controlled using handlebars, and the sailor can adjust their speed and direction by shifting their weight on the seat.",
    "scuba diving: if all ships and boats disappeared, the only way to travel across the ocean would be to scuba dive. The sailor would need to find a source of oxygen and dive down to the ocean floor, where they could swim in any direction they please. However, this would be a dangerous and challenging way to travel, as the sailor would need to be skilled in scuba diving and able to navigate underwater."
