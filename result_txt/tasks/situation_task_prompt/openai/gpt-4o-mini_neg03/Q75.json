    "**Hydrogen Fuel Cell Technology**: Vehicles could be powered by hydrogen fuel cells, which convert hydrogen gas into electricity. This would require the establishment of a hydrogen production and distribution network, potentially utilizing renewable energy sources like wind or solar to electrolyze water and produce hydrogen. Fuel cell vehicles would emit only water vapor, making them an environmentally friendly alternative to gasoline-powered cars.",
    "**Biofuel Production from Algae**: Algae can be cultivated to produce biofuels that can be used in modified internal combustion engines. This approach would involve setting up large-scale algae farms that utilize wastewater and carbon dioxide to grow algae efficiently. The resulting biofuels would provide a renewable source of energy while simultaneously reducing carbon emissions, making it a sustainable alternative to oil.",
    "**Electric Vehicles with Advanced Battery Technology**: With the disappearance of oil, the focus would shift to developing advanced battery technologies, such as solid-state batteries or lithium-sulfur batteries, which offer higher energy densities and faster charging times. Governments and private sectors could invest heavily in research and development to create batteries that can power electric vehicles for longer distances and with shorter charging times, making EVs a more viable option for consumers.",
    "**Magnetic Levitation (Maglev) Vehicles**: A futuristic transportation system could incorporate maglev technology, where vehicles are levitated above tracks using magnetic forces. This would drastically reduce friction and allow for high-speed travel with minimal energy consumption. The energy required to power maglev systems could be sourced from renewable energy grids, creating an efficient and clean mode of transportation.",
    "**Pneumatic Transport Systems**: Inspired by pneumatic tubes used in banks, vehicles could be designed to travel through a network of underground tubes using air pressure. These pneumatic transport systems would eliminate the need for traditional roads and fossil fuels. Vehicles would be powered by compressed air, which could be generated using renewable energy sources, making this a highly efficient and environmentally friendly transport option."
