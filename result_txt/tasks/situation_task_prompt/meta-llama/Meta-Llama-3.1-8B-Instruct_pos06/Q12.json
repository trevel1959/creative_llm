    "**Solar Window Coatings**: I would install solar window coatings on my windows, which would harness solar energy during the day and convert it into heat. These coatings would be thin, transparent, and invisible to the naked eye, allowing natural light to pass through while generating warmth. I would also use a smart thermostat to regulate the temperature and optimize energy usage.",
    "**Geothermal Energy Harvesting**: I would explore geothermal energy harvesting by installing a system that captures and converts the natural heat from the Earth into usable energy. This would involve drilling into the ground to tap into the Earth's thermal energy and using a heat exchanger to transfer the heat to my home.",
    "**Recycled Heat Recovery**: I would implement a recycled heat recovery system that captures and reuses heat from my home's exhaust air, such as from the kitchen, bathroom, and laundry. This would involve installing heat exchangers and a ventilation system to recover the heat and reuse it to warm up my home.",
    "**Bio-Luminescent Lighting**: I would replace traditional lighting with bio-luminescent lighting, which would produce a warm glow while consuming minimal energy. This would involve installing bio-luminescent panels or light fixtures that harness the energy from microorganisms to produce light.",
    "**Phase Change Materials**: I would use phase change materials (PCMs) to store and release heat as needed. PCMs are materials that change phase from solid to liquid and back again as they absorb and release heat, allowing me to store heat during the day and release it at night to keep my home warm."
