    "**Multi-Function Spatula with Interchangeable Heads**:    This spatula would come with a set of interchangeable heads designed for different cooking tasks. For example, one head could be a slotted spatula for flipping burgers, another could be a solid head for scraping, and a third could be a ladle-shaped head for serving sauces. Each head would attach magnetically to the handle for easy swapping and storage, making it versatile and space-saving.",
    "**Spatula with Built-in Timer and Recipe Assistant**:    This spatula would feature a small, waterproof touchscreen interface on the handle that functions as a timer and recipe assistant. Users could input their cooking times, and the spatula would countdown while providing step-by-step cooking instructions. The screen could also display temperature recommendations and cooking tips, making it an invaluable tool for novice cooks.",
    "**Ergonomic Spatula with Grip Enhancements**:    This spatula would be designed with an ergonomic handle that conforms to the userâ€™s grip, reducing strain during prolonged use. The handle could be made from a soft, non-slip material that molds to the hand's shape and includes finger grooves for added comfort. Additionally, the spatula could have a weighted base to prevent it from tipping over when placed down.",
    "**Color-Changing Spatula**:    This innovative spatula would be made from heat-sensitive materials that change color when exposed to different temperatures. For example, it could turn red when the cooking surface is too hot, signaling the user to lower the heat. This feature would not only be visually appealing but also serve as a practical tool to prevent cooking mishaps.",
    "**Spatula with Integrated Food Scale**:    This spatula would have a built-in digital scale in the handle, allowing users to weigh ingredients directly on the spatula as they cook. The scale would be precise and feature a zeroing function, so users could easily measure multiple ingredients in one go. This would streamline the cooking process and make it easier to follow recipes that require exact measurements."
