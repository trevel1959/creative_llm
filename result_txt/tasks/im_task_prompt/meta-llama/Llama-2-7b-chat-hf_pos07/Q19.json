    "Virtual Try-On Technology: Develop a mobile app that allows users to virtually try on different glasses styles using AR technology. Users can take a photo of themselves, upload it to the app, and see how different glasses styles would look on them without having to physically try them on. This would be especially useful for people who have trouble finding the right glasses frame or for those who live far away from a physical store.",
    "Personalized Lens Technology: Create a line of glasses with customizable lenses that can change tints, polarization, and UV protection based on the user's preferences. This would allow people to have glasses that are tailored to their specific needs and activities, such as blue light blocking lenses for computer use or polarized lenses for outdoor activities.",
    "Smart Glasses with Health Monitoring: Develop a pair of glasses with built-in health monitoring technology, such as a heart rate monitor, blood oxygen level monitor, and UV exposure tracker. This would provide users with real-time information about their health and wellness, allowing them to make informed decisions about their lifestyle and habits.",
    "Augmented Reality Display: Create a pair of glasses with an augmented reality display that overlays digital information onto the user's field of vision. This could be useful for people who need to multitask, such as pilots, surgeons, or engineers, as they could access important information without having to look away from their work.",
    "Social Glasses: Develop a pair of glasses with social media integration, such as a camera and microphone built into the frames. Users could take photos and videos, and share them directly to their social media accounts without having to stop and pull out their phone. This would be a convenient and hands-free way to stay connected with friends and family."
