This workshop could include a session on using a tape measure creatively in everyday life, for example, measuring spaces for DIY home improvement projects or planning out your day to allocate specific amounts of time to different tasks. Participants could learn how to break down large tasks into smaller, more manageable parts, similar to how a tape measure helps in dividing long distances into smaller, measurable units.",

Here, you can use the concept of a tape measure to symbolize the journey of self-discovery and personal growth.
