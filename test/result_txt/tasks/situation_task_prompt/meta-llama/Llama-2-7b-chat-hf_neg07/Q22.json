    "Personalized Hoverboards: With all roads disappearing, people could use personalized hoverboards to move around the town or city. These hoverboards could be equipped with advanced sensors and navigation systems, allowing riders to easily navigate through the air with ease. The hoverboards could also be customized with different designs, colors, and features to suit individual preferences.",
    "Airbus-like Transportation: Another option would be to create a network of airbus-like transportation systems that could take people from one place to another. These transportation systems could be powered by electricity or other clean energy sources and could travel at high speeds, reducing travel time significantly. The airbuses could be designed to accommodate a large number of passengers, making them an efficient mode of transportation.",
    "Maglev Trains: Maglev trains are already in use in some parts of the world, and they could be an excellent option for moving around a town or city without roads. Maglev trains use magnetic levitation technology to lift the train above the track, reducing friction and allowing for faster travel. These trains could be powered by electricity or other clean energy sources and could be designed to accommodate different numbers of passengers.",
    "Personal Flying Devices: With the help of advanced technology, personal flying devices could become a reality, allowing people to move around their town or city with ease. These devices could be equipped with sensors, GPS, and other features that make navigation simple and safe. They could also be customized with different designs and colors to suit individual preferences.",
    "Underground Tunnels: In some cases, it might be possible to create a network of underground tunnels that could be used for transportation. These tunnels could be designed to accommodate different modes of transportation, such as cars, buses, or even personal vehicles. The tunnels could be powered by electricity or other clean energy sources, making them an efficient and environmentally friendly option for moving around a town or city."
