    "**Garden Tool**: Use rubber gloves as a protective layer when handling thorny plants or rough garden materials. The gloves can also be filled with soil and used as a mold to create decorative plant pots. Simply shape the gloves into a desired pot shape, fill them with potting mix, and then carefully cut the glove away to reveal your new planter.",
    "**Scented Air Fresheners**: Fill a rubber glove with baking soda and a few drops of your favorite essential oils.
