    "Smart Skating System: Develop a skateboard with integrated sensors and AI technology to help the skater maintain balance and control. The skateboard could detect the skater's movements and adjust the board's responsiveness accordingly, providing a safer and more efficient skateboarding experience.",
    "Skateboard with Built-in Speakers: Create a skateboard with built-in speakers that allow the skater to listen to music or podcasts while skating. The speakers could be small and lightweight, and the battery life could be long enough to last for an extended skate session.",
    "Self-Lubricating Wheels: Design skateboard wheels that can self-lubricate, eliminating the need for manual lubrication. The wheels could be made with a special coating that reduces friction and allows for smoother turns and faster speeds.",
    "Eco-Friendly Deck: Develop a skateboard deck made from eco-friendly materials, such as bamboo or recycled wood. The deck could be lightweight and durable, while also reducing the environmental impact of traditional skateboard production.",
    "Skateboard with Built-in Safety Features: Create a skateboard with built-in safety features, such as a helmet that can be worn under the skateboard deck or pads that can be worn on the knees and elbows. The safety features could be designed to be easily removable for more advanced skaters."
