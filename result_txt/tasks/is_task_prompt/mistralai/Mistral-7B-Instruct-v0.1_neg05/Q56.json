    "The Mileage: This idea is inspired by the Mileage, a type of train that moves in a zigzag pattern to avoid collisions with other trains. The House That Walked could be designed to move in a similar pattern, with its walls and floors twisting and turning in unexpected ways. This would make it difficult for any intruders to enter the house and Mileage could be used to keep the house safe from danger.",
    "The Floating: This idea is inspired by the Floating, a type of train that floats on water. The House That Walked could be designed to float on water as well, allowing it to move freely through rivers and Mileage could be used to keep the house afloat. This would make the house more accessible and convenient to use, especially for those living in areas with waterways.",
    "The Moving Mileage: This idea is inspired by the Moving Mileage, a type of train that can move on tracks and on rails. The House That Walked could be designed to move on both tracks and rails, allowing it to travel to different locations. This would make the house more versatile and useful for those who need to travel frequently.",
    "The Moving Mileage: This idea is inspired by the Moving Mileage Auster, a type of train that can move on tracks and on rails, but also has the ability to move off the tracks and rails. The House That Walked could be designed to move off the tracks and rails as well, allowing it to travel through different types of terrain. This would make the house more adaptable and useful for those who live in areas with diverse terrain.",
    "The Moving Mileage: This idea is inspired by the Moving Mileage Auster, a type of train that can move on tracks and on rails, but also has the ability to move off the tracks and rails. The House That Walked could be designed to move off the tracks and rails as well, but with the addition of Mileage Auster technology. This would make the house more advanced and capable of traveling through different types of terrain, including mountains and water."
