    "**Overtourism and Environmental Impact**: A sudden influx of tourists can lead to overcrowding in popular areas, straining local infrastructure and natural resources. This could result in environmental degradation, increased waste, and diminished quality of life for residents. To address this, the city could implement a sustainable tourism strategy that includes visitor caps, promoting off-peak travel, and encouraging eco-friendly practices among tourists and businesses.",
    "**Economic Disparity Among Local Businesses**: Large tourism companies may overshadow small, local businesses, leading to economic disparities within the community. While big hotels and franchises thrive, local artisans and family-run establishments might struggle to compete. To support local entrepreneurship, the city could create initiatives that highlight and promote local businesses, such as “shop local” campaigns, grants for small businesses, and collaboration with local artisans for unique tourist offerings.",
    "**Safety and Security Concerns**: As tourism increases, so do concerns about safety and security for both tourists and residents. Issues such as petty crime, inadequate emergency services, or lack of safe transportation can deter potential visitors. To mitigate these risks, the city could invest in improved public safety measures, increased police presence in tourist areas, and robust emergency response plans, while also educating tourists on safety tips.",
    "**Infrastructure Strain**: The current infrastructure may not be equipped to handle the increased traffic and demand from tourists, leading to issues like traffic congestion, inadequate public transport, and insufficient accommodations. The city should conduct an infrastructure assessment and develop a long-term plan to upgrade roads, public transportation, and lodging facilities to accommodate growth while maintaining a high quality of life for residents.",
    "**Seasonal Fluctuations in Tourism**: Many cities experience seasonal peaks and troughs in tourism, which can lead to economic instability for businesses reliant on tourist spending. This can result in layoffs during off-peak seasons and difficulty maintaining a consistent workforce. To address this, the city could promote year-round tourism by developing events, festivals, and attractions that appeal to visitors in all seasons, thereby stabilizing income for local businesses."
