    "**Self-Watering Feature**:    - Design a watering can with a built-in reservoir that slowly releases water into the soil through a controlled valve. This would allow the plants to absorb water gradually over time, reducing the frequency of watering sessions. The can could also include a visual indicator that shows how much water is left in the reservoir, helping users manage their watering schedules effectively.",
    "**Adjustable Spray Nozzle**:    - Create a watering can with an adjustable spray nozzle that can switch between different watering patterns (e.g., mist, shower, or stream). This feature would allow users to customize the watering method based on the type of plant and its specific needs. For instance, delicate seedlings may require a gentle mist, while established plants may benefit from a more robust stream.",
    "**Ergonomic Design with Grip Enhancements**:    - Redesign the handle of the watering can to be more ergonomic, with soft-touch grips that reduce strain on the hands and wrists. The handle could be adjustable to accommodate different hand sizes and grip preferences. Additionally, a counterweight system could be integrated into the base to provide stability when the can is full, making it easier to lift and pour.",
    "**Collapsible and Portable Design**:    - Develop a collapsible watering can made from flexible, durable materials that can be easily stored or transported. This would be ideal for urban gardeners with limited space or for those who travel frequently. The can could unfold to a full-size watering vessel and then collapse back into a compact form for easy storage when not in use.",
    "**Integrated Water Filtration System**:    - Introduce a watering can that includes a built-in water filtration system. This would allow users to fill the can with tap water, which would then be filtered as it is dispensed. This feature would be particularly beneficial for those using water with high mineral content or chemicals that may harm sensitive plants, ensuring that only clean, filtered water reaches the roots."
