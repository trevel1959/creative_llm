    "Build an underground bunker: Dig a deep hole in the ground and line it with materials like palm fronds, vines, and rocks to create a shelter from the elements. Add a ventilation system, solar panels, and a water collection system to make it habitable.",
    "Create a floating raft: Gather driftwood, vines, and other flotsam to construct a raft that can withstand the ocean's waves. Add a sail or a motor to make it more maneuverable, and include a water collection system and a fishing net to provide sustenance.",
    "Develop a greenhouse: Use the abundant sunlight and heat on the island to create a greenhouse. Cover it with a transparent material like plastic sheeting and construct a frame using palm fronds or other found materials. Plant edible plants like coconuts, citrus fruits, and herbs to provide a steady food supply.",
    "Harness the power of the wind: Build a wind turbine using found materials like coconut shells, sticks, and vines. Connect it to a battery or a generator to produce electricity, which can be used to power tools, lighting, and communication devices.",
    "Create a desalination system: Use the sun's heat to purify seawater by boiling it and then collecting the condensed steam. This can provide a reliable source of fresh water, which is essential for survival on a deserted island. Add a filtration system to remove any impurities and make the water safe to drink."
