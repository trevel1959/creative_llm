    "Nature-Inspired Art: Embrace the beauty of nature and use natural materials to create unique and sustainable decorations. Instead of using paint, incorporate elements like branches, leaves, rocks, and flowers to create a stunning and organic look. For example, use a branch to create a unique light fixture or hang a vase filled with flowers to add a pop of color to a room.",
    "Light Installations: Utilize light to create a breathtaking decor that doesn't require paint. Use LED lights, fiber optics, or even glow-in-the-dark paint to create intricate designs and patterns on walls, ceilings, or even furniture. You could create a stunning light installation that changes colors and patterns to match your mood or the time of day.",
    "Textile Art: Instead of painting walls, use textiles to create vibrant and colorful decorations. Use fabric, yarn, or even paper to create tapestries, wall hangings, or even 3D installations. You could also incorporate embroidery, beading, or other textile techniques to add intricate details and patterns to your designs.",
    "Mirrored Reflections: Take inspiration from the art of mirror-making and create decorations that use mirrors as the primary medium.

You could also incorporate lights or other decorative elements to create a stunning and eye-catching display.",
    "Shadow Puppetry: Use shadows to create a unique and captivating decor that doesn't require paint. Use puppets, cut-out shapes, or even your own body to create intricate and dynamic shadow patterns on walls or even ceilings.
