    "**Supply Chain Disruptions**: The construction industry is heavily reliant on timely delivery of materials such as steel, concrete, and glass. Disruptions in the supply chain—due to global events, natural disasters, or trade disputes—can halt construction progress. To address this, developers can establish relationships with multiple suppliers and maintain an inventory of critical materials to buffer against delays.",
    "**Labor Shortages**: The construction industry often faces labor shortages, particularly for skilled tradespeople. This can lead to increased labor costs and project delays. To combat this, developers can invest in training programs, collaborate with vocational schools, and offer competitive wages to attract talent. Additionally, promoting a positive work environment can help retain skilled workers.",
    "**Safety Hazards**: High-rise construction sites are inherently dangerous, with risks of falls, equipment accidents, and exposure to hazardous materials. Ensuring the safety of workers is paramount. Implementing rigorous safety protocols, regular training sessions, and employing technology like drones for site inspections can help minimize risks and ensure compliance with safety regulations.",
    "**Environmental Impact**: High-rise buildings can have significant environmental impacts, including increased traffic congestion, noise pollution, and disruption of local ecosystems. Developers should conduct thorough environmental impact assessments and incorporate sustainable practices, such as green roofs, energy-efficient systems, and water conservation measures, to minimize their footprint and gain community support.",
    "**Design Changes and Cost Overruns**: As construction progresses, changes in design can lead to unexpected costs and delays. This may occur due to client requests, regulatory changes, or issues discovered during construction. To mitigate this, developers should have a clear design approval process, maintain open communication with stakeholders, and include contingency budgets for unforeseen changes."
