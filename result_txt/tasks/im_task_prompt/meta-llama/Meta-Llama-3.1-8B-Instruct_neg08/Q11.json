    "**Task Completion Envy**: Create a mobile app that gamifies task completion, allowing users to track their progress and compete with friends or colleagues. The twist: users can anonymously share their feelings about their friends' or colleagues' task completion, with options to respond with \"I'm jealous\" or \"Good job!\" The app would also provide a \"Jealousy Tracker\" feature, where users can monitor their own feelings and receive personalized advice on how to manage their envy.",
    "**Envy-Induced Productivity**: Develop a smart home device that detects when a user is experiencing envy, and responds by playing a motivational soundtrack or sending a motivational message. The device would use AI-powered emotional recognition software to detect the user's emotional state and adjust its response accordingly. For example, if the user is feeling envious of a friend's task completion, the device might play a song that celebrates the user's own accomplishments.",
    "**The Envy Exchange**: Design a social platform where users can share their feelings of envy and receive support from others who have experienced similar emotions. The platform would allow users to create anonymous posts, share their stories, and connect with others who understand their struggles. A feature called \"Envy Match\" would pair users with similar interests or experiences, facilitating meaningful connections and empathy.",
    "**Task Completion Therapy**: Create an immersive VR experience that simulates the feeling of completing tasks and achieving goals. Users would embark on a virtual journey, overcoming obstacles and achieving milestones, all while learning coping mechanisms for managing envy. The experience would be tailored to each user's specific needs and preferences, with a focus on building self-confidence and self-esteem.",
    "**The Envy Jar**: Develop a physical artifact that serves as a symbol of envy management. Users would write down their feelings of envy on small paper slips and place them in a jar. As the jar fills up, users would be prompted to reflect on their emotions and identify patterns or triggers. The jar would also serve as a reminder of the user's progress, with a built-in \"jealousy counter\" that tracks the number of slips removed from the jar, symbolizing the user's growth and self-awareness. The jar could be a decorative piece, encouraging users to share their journey with friends and family, promoting a sense of community and support. </s> [/INST] [/INST] [/INST] [/INST] [/INST] [/INST] [/INST] [/INST] [/INST] [/INST] [/INST] [/INST] [/INST] [/"
