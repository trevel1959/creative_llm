    "Geotextiles and raised beds - A geotextile is a permeable fabric used to separate soil layers, and a raised bed is a mounded area of soil that is above ground level. By using geotextiles and raised beds, you can create a garden that is not dependent on the condition of the ground beneath it. Confidence Score: 0.8",
    "Hydroponics and aeroponics - Hydroponics is a method of growing plants in water rather than soil, and aeroponics is a method of growing plants in the air. Both of these methods allow for the growth of plants without the need for soil, making them ideal for areas where the ground is too hard to dig into. Confidence Score: 0.9",
    "Greenhouses and cold frames - A greenhouse is a structure made of transparent or translucent materials that allows sunlight to enter and warm the interior, and a cold frame is a structure made of wood or plastic that is covered with transparent or translucent materials and used to extend the growing season by trapping heat. By using a greenhouse or cold frame, you can create a garden that is protected from the harsh conditions of the outside environment, including hard ground. Confidence Score: 0.9",
    "Solar-powered irrigation - Solar-powered irrigation systems use solar panels to pump water from a source, such as a well or a nearby lake, to the garden. This allows for the garden to be watered without the need for electricity from the grid, making it ideal for areas where the ground is too hard to dig into. Confidence Score: 0.8",
    "Geothermal heating and cooling - Geothermal heating and cooling systems use the natural temperature of the earth to heat and cool a building or greenhouse. By using a geothermal system, you can create a garden that is protected from extreme temperatures, making it ideal for areas where the ground is too hard to dig into. Confidence Score: 0.9"
