    "**Modular Juicing System**:    Design a modular juicer that allows users to swap out different components based on their needs. For instance, a user could have attachments for juicing hard fruits, soft fruits, leafy greens, or even nuts for nut milk. This flexibility would allow for more efficient juicing, minimizing waste and maximizing yield. Each module could have its own cleaning mechanism, making maintenance easier.",
    "**Self-Cleaning Technology**:    Introduce a self-cleaning feature that utilizes ultrasonic cleaning technology. After juicing, users could simply add water and a drop of soap, and the juicer would use ultrasonic waves to clean itself thoroughly. This feature would save time and effort, making juicing a more convenient daily habit. Additionally, a detachable self-cleaning bowl could be included for easy disposal of pulp.",
    "**Sustainable Juicer with Composting Feature**:    Create a juicer designed with sustainability in mind, featuring a built-in composting system for the pulp and waste generated during juicing. This could involve a separate compartment where users can add the pulp, which would then be processed into compost over time. This would not only reduce waste but also encourage users to engage in sustainable practices, turning their juicing routine into an eco-friendly habit.",
    "**Interactive Juicing Experience**:    Incorporate augmented reality (AR) technology into the juicer. Users could wear AR glasses or use a smartphone to visualize the juicing process in real-time, seeing how much juice is extracted from different fruits or vegetables. This feature could also provide educational content about the nutritional benefits of the ingredients being juiced, making the experience more engaging and informative.",
    "**Flavor Infuser Attachment**:    Develop an attachment for the juicer that allows users to infuse their juices with herbs, spices, or other flavorings. This could be a separate chamber where users can add mint, ginger, or turmeric, which would then blend with the juice as it is extracted. This would open up a world of flavor combinations, encouraging users to experiment and create unique, delicious beverages."
