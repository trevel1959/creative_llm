    "Multiverse Theory: The universe would be part of a much larger multiverse, containing an infinite number of parallel universes with different physical laws and properties. These universes would be connected through wormholes, which would allow for inter-universal travel and interaction.",
    "Infinite Dimensions: The universe would exist in infinite dimensions rather than the three we experience. This would allow for the existence of parallel universes in higher dimensions and would be a result of a fifth force that interacts with gravity and the other fundamental forces.",
    "Time is an illusion: The concept of time would be an illusion, existing only as a human construct. Time would not be a fundamental force or dimension, but rather a way of measuring change in the universe. This would have significant implications for our understanding of history and the nature of reality.",
    "Quantum Fluctuations: The universe would be governed by quantum fluctuations, with small variations in energy and matter creating the basis for everything we see. These fluctuations would be random and would result in the emergence of complex structures and life.",
    "Dualism: The universe would be governed by dualism, with particles and waves existing simultaneously and in a state of constant superposition. This would explain the strange and seemingly random behavior of quantum particles and lead to new insights into the nature of reality."
