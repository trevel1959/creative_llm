    "Towels with built-in filters: Another way to improve a towel is to integrate it with other functional elements like filters. For instance, a towel could be designed with embedded water filters that can remove impurities from water, making it safer to drink, as well as useful for outdoor activities like camping or hiking.",
    "Towels with built-in UV protection: One problem with many towels is that they don't provide enough protection from the sun, making them unsuitable for outdoor activities like sunbathing or beach outings. To address this issue, a towel can be designed with built-in UV protection, such as a layer of sunblock or a special material that reflects sunlight, helping to prevent sunburn.",
    "Towels made from sustainable materials: Another way to improve a towel is by using sustainable and eco-friendly materials. For example, a company could develop a line of towels made from organic cotton, bamboo, or recycled fibers, making them more environmentally friendly and appealing to consumers who are conscious of their impact on the environment.",
    "Smart towels: One way to take the towel to the next level is by incorporating smart technology into its design. For instance, a towel could be equipped with sensors that monitor the user's health and wellbeing by tracking body temperature, heart rate, and other vital signs, and then providing feedback and recommendations based on this data.",
    "Towels that can be worn on the body: Another way to improve a towel is by designing it in such a way that it can be worn on the body, providing additional functionality. For example, a towel that can be worn as a scarf, bandana, or shawl around the neck can be especially useful during colder weather or while exercising."
