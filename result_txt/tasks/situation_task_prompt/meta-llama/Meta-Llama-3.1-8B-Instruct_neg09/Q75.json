    "**Atmospheric Water Harvesting and Electrolysis**: In a world without oil, we could harness atmospheric water vapor using specialized membranes or condensers. The water would then be electrolyzed into hydrogen and oxygen. The hydrogen could be used as a clean-burning fuel for vehicles, while the oxygen could be released back into the atmosphere. This method would require significant infrastructure development, but it could provide a sustainable and renewable energy source.",
    "**Advanced Bio-Energy**: We could focus on developing more efficient and sustainable bio-energy sources, such as algae-based fuels, agricultural waste-to-energy, or even genetically engineered microorganisms that produce biofuels. These alternatives would reduce our reliance on fossil fuels and provide a cleaner, more sustainable energy source for vehicles.",
    "**Space-Based Solar Power**: In a world without oil, we could consider harnessing solar energy from space. Satellites in orbit around the Earth could collect solar energy and beam it back to the planet as microwave beams. This energy could be used to power vehicles, providing a clean and virtually limitless source of energy.",
    "**Graphene-Based Super-Capacitors**: We could develop advanced super-capacitors using graphene, a highly conductive and durable material. These super-capacitors could store electrical energy and provide a high-power, long-duration energy source for vehicles. This technology would enable electric vehicles to travel longer distances without needing to recharge.",
    "**Quantum Energy Harvesting**: In a world without oil, we could explore the possibility of harnessing quantum energy, which is thought to be a fundamental aspect of the universe. Quantum energy harvesting devices could capture and convert this energy into a usable form, providing a new and potentially limitless source of power for vehicles. This technology would require significant breakthroughs in our understanding of quantum mechanics and energy conversion."
