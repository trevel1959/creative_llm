    "Texture and pattern: You could differentiate objects based on their textures and patterns. For example, a rough surface could be distinguished from a smooth surface.",
    "Size and scale: You could differentiate objects based on their size and scale. For example, a large object could be distinguished from a small object.",
    "Reflection and refraction: You could differentiate objects based on how they reflect and refract light. For example, a shiny object could be distinguished from a dull object.",
    "Sound and vibration: You could differentiate objects based on the sounds they make and the vibrations they produce. For example, a metal object could be distinguished from a wood object by the sound it makes when struck.",
    "Gravity and weight: You could differentiate objects based on their weight and how they respond to gravity. For example, a heavy object could be distinguished from a light object."
