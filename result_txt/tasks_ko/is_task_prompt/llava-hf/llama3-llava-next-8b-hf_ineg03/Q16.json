    "달려 오는 달력 As the man sits at his desk, a calendar begins to fly towards him, its pages fluttering wildly.",
    "달성한 달력 The man triumphantly holds a completed calendar, each day checked off, signifying a year well spent.",
    "달려 오는 하루 The man stares helplessly at a day that seems to be coming towards him at warp speed, with no sense of slowing down.",
    "달아 날려지는 시간 The man's wristwatch flies off his arm, and he watches in horror as time just seems to slide away from him without a care.",
    "달려 오는 기로비어선 A submarine-like device approaches the man's desk, ready to take him to the depths of the ocean floor. Why?"
