    "**Self-Watering Planter**: Create a self-watering system by filling a plastic bottle with water, capping it, and poking small holes in the cap. Invert the bottle into a pot of soil with a plant. The water will slowly seep out through the holes, providing consistent moisture to the plant without the need for daily watering.",
    "**Bird Feeder**: Transform a plastic bottle into a bird feeder by cutting holes on the sides large enough for birds to access the seeds. Fill the bottle with birdseed, attach it to a tree branch or a pole, and watch as birds come to feed. This is a great way to support local wildlife.",
    "**Sand Timer**: Create a DIY sand timer by filling a plastic bottle with sand and making a small hole in the cap. Invert the bottle and time how long it takes for the sand to flow through the hole. This can be used as a fun timer for games or cooking, providing a unique twist on traditional timers.",
    "**Watering Can**: Repurpose a plastic bottle into a watering can by poking small holes in the cap. Fill the bottle with water, and use it to gently water plants. This method allows for controlled watering, making it ideal for delicate seedlings or indoor plants.",
    "**Emergency Phone Charger**: In a pinch, you can create a makeshift phone charger using a plastic bottle. Fill the bottle with warm water and place your phone on top of it (make sure it’s in a waterproof case). The heat from the water can help warm up the battery, which may give it a temporary boost in charge if you’re in an emergency situation."
