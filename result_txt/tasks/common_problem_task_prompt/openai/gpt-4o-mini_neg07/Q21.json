    "**Cyberbullying**: With the rise of social media and online communication, cyberbullying has become a prevalent issue. Children may face harassment or negative interactions online, which can lead to emotional distress and anxiety. Parents may find it challenging to monitor their childâ€™s online interactions effectively, and the anonymity of the internet can make it difficult to address bullying situations appropriately.",
    "**Digital Addiction**: The addictive nature of digital devices and games can pose a serious problem for children. Many children may find it hard to disengage from their screens, leading to compulsive behaviors. This addiction can interfere with their daily responsibilities, such as homework, chores, and family time. Parents may struggle to enforce limits and create healthy boundaries around technology use.",
    "**Inadequate Digital Literacy**: As technology evolves, the need for digital literacy becomes more critical. Children may not receive adequate education on how to navigate the digital world safely and responsibly. This lack of knowledge can lead to problems such as sharing personal information, encountering inappropriate content, or falling victim to online scams. Parents may feel overwhelmed by the rapid pace of technological change and unsure how to educate their children about safe online practices.",
    "**Privacy Concerns**: Raising a child in the digital age raises significant concerns about privacy. Children often share personal information online without understanding the long-term implications. This can lead to data breaches, identity theft, or unwanted attention. Parents may find it challenging to instill a sense of privacy awareness in their children while still allowing them to engage with social media and other online platforms.",
    "**Impaired Attention Span**: The constant stimulation provided by digital devices can contribute to shorter attention spans in children. With the rapid-fire nature of content consumption online, children may struggle to focus on tasks that require sustained attention, such as reading or studying. Parents may notice their children becoming easily distracted and may need to find creative strategies to help them develop better concentration skills."
