    "**Smoke signals**: In this scenario, people could use smoke signals to communicate long distances. They would build a fire, and depending on the size and intensity of the smoke, they could send messages about different things, such as danger or location.",
    "**Mirror signals**: People could use mirrors to send messages through a series of reflections. By positioning the mirrors at different angles and distances, they could create a sequence of signals that would indicate the message they want to send.",
    "**Light signals**: Similar to smoke signals, people could use light signals to communicate long distances. They would use lanterns or torches to send messages by varying the intensity and color of the light.",
    "**Sound signals**: In this case, people could use sound signals to communicate long distances. They would use different types of instruments or objects to create different sounds, which could be used to convey messages.",
    "**Morse code**: Although this method would be slower than modern communication methods, people could use Morse code to communicate long distances. They would use a series of taps or clicks to spell out messages."
