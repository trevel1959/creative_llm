    "Gestures and Body Language: People could use a combination of hand gestures, facial expressions, and body language to convey their thoughts and ideas. This would involve exaggerating and amplifying natural gestures to convey more complex ideas, such as waving goodbye or pointing to an object to indicate direction.",
    "Drawing and Painting: With the absence of language, people could use drawing and painting to convey messages. They could create pictures that represent objects, actions, or ideas, and use colors to convey emotions and moods. For example, a red circle could represent danger, while a blue square could represent safety.",
    "Music and Rhythm: Music and rhythm could become a primary means of communication. People could use different melodies and rhythms to convey emotions and ideas, such as a fast-paced melody for excitement or a slow, mournful tune for sadness.",
    "Dance and Movement: Similar to gestures and body language, people could use dance and movement to communicate. They could create complex routines that convey specific ideas or emotions, such as a jump for joy or a stomp for anger.",
    "Visual Storytelling: People could use visual storytelling techniques, such as comics or graphic novels, to convey complex ideas and emotions. These visual narratives could be created using a combination of images, text, and symbols, and could be shared with others through books, magazines, or digital platforms."
