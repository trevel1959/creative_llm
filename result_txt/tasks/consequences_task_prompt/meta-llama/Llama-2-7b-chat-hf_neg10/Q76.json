    "Theme Park Adventures: Create a theme park where visitors can interact with resurrected dinosaurs in a controlled environment. The park could feature different habitats, such as a T-Rex Territory, a Triceratops Enclosure, and a Pterodactyl Plex. Visitors could take a guided tour, feed the dinosaurs, and even ride on a dinosaur-themed rollercoaster. This would provide a unique and exciting experience for visitors while also sparking curiosity and wonder about these prehistoric creatures.",
    "Dinosaur Therapy: Develop a program where therapists use resurrected dinosaurs as a form of therapy for people with mental health issues. The therapy sessions could involve interacting with the dinosaurs in a controlled environment, such as a sensory deprivation tank or a virtual reality simulation. The dinosaurs could be programmed to emit soothing sounds or vibrations, promoting relaxation and reducing stress. This unconventional approach to therapy could provide a new and effective way to help people manage their mental health.",
    "Dinosaur Conservation: Create a conservation program focused on preserving the genetic material of resurrected dinosaurs. The program could involve collecting DNA samples from the resurrected dinosaurs and storing them in a secure facility. This would ensure that the genetic material is protected and could be used to restore the species if they become extinct again in the future. The program could also involve breeding programs to increase the population of resurrected dinosaurs and promote their survival in the wild.",
    "Dinosaur-Inspired Technology: Develop new technologies inspired by the characteristics and abilities of resurrected dinosaurs. For example, engineers could design robots that mimic the strength and agility of velociraptors or develop materials that are as lightweight and flexible as feathers. The technology could have a wide range of applications, from space exploration to medical devices. This could provide a new source of innovation and inspiration for scientists and engineers.",
    "Jurassic Ecosystem Restoration: Work towards restoring the ecosystems of the prehistoric world by reintroducing resurrected dinosaurs into their natural habit"
