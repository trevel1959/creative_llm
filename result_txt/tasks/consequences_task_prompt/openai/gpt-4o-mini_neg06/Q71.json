    "**Resource Scarcity and Environmental Impact**: With people living indefinitely, the strain on natural resources would intensify. The population would swell as birth rates might remain unchanged or even increase, leading to potential shortages of food, water, and energy. The environmental impact would be significant, possibly exacerbating climate change and habitat destruction. This could prompt a global crisis that forces humanity to find sustainable solutions, such as advanced recycling technologies or the colonization of other planets.",
    "**Psychological Effects and Existential Crises**: Immortality could lead to profound psychological consequences. Individuals may experience existential crises as they grapple with the meaning of life when time is no longer a limiting factor. The boredom of eternal life could lead to widespread mental health issues, prompting a need for new forms of therapy and philosophical exploration. Society might see a rise in the demand for experiences that provide meaning, such as art, adventure, and personal growth.",
    "**Inequality and Class Divisions**: The ability to achieve immortality might not be accessible to everyone, leading to stark class divisions. Those who can afford the technology or treatment would live indefinitely, while the less fortunate may face a finite existence. This could create a new form of social stratification, with \"immortals\" wielding significant power and influence over the \"mortals.\" This disparity could spark social unrest, revolutions, or new forms of governance aimed at addressing inequality.",
    "**Shift in Cultural Values and Ethics**: Immortality would challenge existing cultural and ethical norms. The value placed on youth and beauty might shift as society adjusts to the concept of eternal life. New moral dilemmas would arise, such as the ethics of procreation in an immortal society and the responsibility of individuals to care for the planet and future generations. This could lead to the emergence of new philosophies and belief systems focused on sustainability and the collective good.",
    "**Legal and Political Ramifications**: The legal system would need to adapt to the implications of immortality. Issues surrounding inheritance, property rights, and criminal justice would require reevaluation. For instance, how would laws apply to someone who has lived for centuries? Would there be a limit to how long one can hold office, or would lifetime appointments become the norm? Political systems might evolve to accommodate the unique needs and perspectives of an immortal population."
