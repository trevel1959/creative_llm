    "\"I could have made a themed lunchbox for each day of the week, like a colorful rainbow or a different country's cuisine, to keep things interesting and exciting.\"",
    "\"I could have packed a variety of healthy snacks and meals, like fruits, veggies, whole grains, and lean proteins, to make sure I had a balanced and nutritious lunch every day.\"",
    "\"I could have brought a reusable water bottle and a thermos to keep my drinks hot or cold, instead of constantly buying single-use plastic bottles.\"",
    "\"I could have made a schedule to pack my lunchbox the night before, so I didn't have to think about it in the morning and could focus on other tasks.\"",
    "\"I could have tried new recipes and ingredients to keep my lunches exciting and prevent boredom with the same old meals.\""
