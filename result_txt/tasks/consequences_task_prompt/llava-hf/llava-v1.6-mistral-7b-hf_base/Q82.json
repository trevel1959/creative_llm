    "**Economic Impact:** The longevity industry would become one of the biggest industries in the world. Companies would be formed to provide anti-aging treatments to an aging population, such as pharmaceutical companies, health retreats, and anti-aging clinics. This could have a profound impact on the global economy.",
    "**Social Changes:** Society would have to adapt to the increased longevity. Social structures and retirement policies would likely change to accommodate people living longer lives. We might see a shift away from mandatory retirement ages and towards more flexible retirement options.",
    "**Health Care and Medical Services:** With a significantly larger aging population, there would be a greater demand for health care and medical services. Governments and private companies would have to come up with new solutions to meet the demand.",
    "**Cultural Perceptions:** The concept of aging would change. Society might begin to view aging as a process that can be managed and prolonged rather than something that is inevitable. This could lead to a change in cultural perceptions of aging.",
    "**Environmental Impact:** The environmental impact of a large, aging population would be significant. Since older people are typically less energy-intensive in their consumption habits, a larger elderly population could be beneficial in reducing overall environmental impact."
