    "**Eco-Friendly Fashion Sourcing:** Instead of traditional wedding dresses, encourage your guests to wear clothing made from organic or recycled materials. You could also hire a vintage or sustainable fashion rental service. The bride could opt for a custom-made dress using upcycled fabrics or sustainable textiles. This not only reduces waste but also aligns with the eco-friendly theme.",
    "**Local and Seasonal Menu:** Collaborate with local farmers and caterers who specialize in seasonal, organic produce. This reduces the carbon footprint associated with food transportation and supports local economies. Offer vegetarian or vegan options to minimize environmental impact further. Consider incorporating edible flowers, herbs, and fruits directly from a nearby garden as garnishes or in desserts.",
    "**Sustainable Transportation:** Encourage guests to use public transportation, carpool, bike, or walk to the venue. Arrange shuttle services if needed, ensuring they run on renewable energy sources. For those arriving by plane, suggest offsetting their carbon emissions through verified climate projects.",
    "**Zero-Waste Venue:** Choose a venue that prioritizes sustainability, such as a location with a strong commitment to reducing waste. Look for places that have implemented recycling systems, composting programs, and energy-efficient practices. Decorations should be reusable or biodegradable, and avoid single-use plastics. Provide guests with reusable plates, utensils, and glasses.",
    "**Charitable Donation in lieu of Gifts:** Instead of receiving traditional wedding gifts, invite guests to donate to a cause you both care about. You could choose an eco-friendly organization focused on conservation, reforestation, or sustainable development. Share information about the charity, its mission, and how your donation will contribute to the cause. This creates a meaningful and lasting impact while celebrating your special day. "
