    "**Artificial Sunlight**: Develop a system that simulates sunlight using LED lights or lasers. This could be installed in buildings or set up as mobile units. The system would mimic the sun's spectrum, providing adequate light for daily activities.",
    "**Solar Panels as Light Sources**: Implement large solar panels on rooftops, streets, and parks to generate electricity during the day. This electricity can be stored in batteries and used to power artificial lights at night. ",
    "**Bioluminescent Plants**: Cultivate plants that naturally produce light through bioluminescence. These plants could be grown indoors or outdoors, creating a natural source of light during the day.",
    "**Sky Mirrors**: Design a massive reflective surface that mirrors the sun, focusing its rays onto areas where light is needed. This could be done using mirrors or large reflective sheets. ",
    "**Infrared Energy Conversion**: Create devices that convert infrared energy from the sun into visible light. This would require advanced technology but could potentially provide a continuous light source even when the sun doesn't rise."
