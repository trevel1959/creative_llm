    "**SmartCane**: A wearable, AI-powered smart cane that provides real-time navigation assistance to visually impaired individuals. The cane is equipped with a 3D sensor, GPS, and a microphone that detect obstacles, stairs, and other environmental hazards. It also features a haptic feedback system, which provides tactile feedback to the user through subtle vibrations, allowing them to navigate through complex spaces with confidence. (Confidence score: 0.9)",
    "**EyesOn**: A wearable, non-invasive, and non-contact device that uses advanced computer vision and machine learning algorithms to provide real-time visual feedback to visually impaired individuals. The device is mounted on a pair of glasses and uses a high-resolution camera to capture and process visual data, which is then converted into a 3D audio representation, allowing the user to \"hear\" their surroundings. (Confidence score: 0.8)",
    "**SoundScout**: A smart, wearable device that uses advanced audio processing and machine learning algorithms to provide real-time audio feedback to visually impaired individuals. The device is equipped with a high-resolution microphone array that captures and analyzes sound patterns, allowing the user to \"hear\" their surroundings in a more nuanced and detailed way. (Confidence score: 0.85)",
    "**TactileTerrain**: A smart, wearable device that uses advanced tactile feedback technology to provide real-time haptic feedback to visually impaired individuals. The device is equipped with a matrix of tactile sensors that detect changes in terrain, obstacles, and other environmental hazards, allowing the user to navigate through complex spaces with confidence. (Confidence score: 0.9)",
    "**NavMind**: A brain-computer interface (BCI) device that uses advanced electroencephalography (EEG) and machine learning algorithms to decode and interpret brain activity, allowing visually impaired individuals to navigate through complex spaces with their minds. The device is non-invasive and non-contact, and can be controlled using a simple mental command. (Confidence score: 0.8)"
