    "**Language Barriers**: Communication might pose a challenge if the student’s proficiency in the host family’s language is limited. This can lead to frustration and feelings of isolation for the student. To address this, families could engage in language exchange activities, such as using apps or games that promote learning while allowing the student to practice their language skills in a fun, low-pressure environment.",
    "**Homesickness**: The foreign exchange student may experience homesickness, particularly if they are away from home for the first time. This can lead to emotional distress and impact their ability to adjust. Host families can help by creating a warm and welcoming environment, encouraging the student to share their feelings, and involving them in family activities that provide a sense of belonging.",
    "**Dietary Restrictions and Preferences**: The student may have specific dietary needs or preferences based on their cultural background, religious beliefs, or personal choices (e.g., vegetarianism, allergies). This can create tension around meal planning and preparation. Host families should communicate openly about food preferences and work together to explore new recipes that accommodate everyone’s tastes, potentially even cooking meals from the student’s home country.",
    "**Different Educational Systems**: The academic expectations and educational systems may differ significantly between the student’s home country and the host country. This can create confusion regarding homework, grading, and participation. To support the student, host families could help them navigate their new school environment by attending orientation sessions, meeting with teachers, and providing resources for academic support, such as tutoring or study groups.",
    "**Social Integration Challenges**: The exchange student might struggle to integrate socially with peers, especially if they are shy or face language barriers. This can lead to feelings of loneliness and isolation. Host families can facilitate social integration by inviting the student to participate in local events, introducing them to neighbors, or arranging playdates with other children, helping them build friendships and connections in their new environment."
