    "Motion sickness: Another potential problem is motion sickness. Some individuals may experience discomfort or nausea when using virtual reality technology, particularly during movement-intensive tasks, posing a barrier to their participation in the training program.",
    "Immersion: Ensuring a high level of immersion in a virtual environment is essential for effective training. However, creating a highly immersive experience can be technically challenging and may require specialized skills and expertise in game design and software development.",
    "User control: The complexity of user controls in virtual reality training programs may create a learning curve that is difficult for novice users to overcome, potentially deterring them from participating in the training altogether.",
    "Realism: Striking a balance between realism and safety is important for training programs. In some cases, it may be necessary to use certain safety measures, such as reducing the speed of moving objects or limiting the force feedback felt by the user, which could impact the training's effectiveness.",
    "Maintenance: Maintaining virtual reality systems can also be a challenge. The hardware and software may require frequent updates or upgrades, leading to additional costs and responsibilities for the organization."
