    "Thermosense: We could create a new thermosense that allows us to perceive changes in temperature in our environment, even when there is no visible heat source. This could help us to keep track of the temperature of our surroundings more accurately and stay more comfortable in extreme climates.",
    "Bioluminescence: We could create a new sense that allows us to perceive bioluminescence in the environment, such as the glow of a firefly or the sparkle of a shooting star. This could provide us with a new way to experience the natural world and allow us to see in places where we previously could not.",
    "Electroencephalogram (EEG): We could create a new sense that allows us to perceive and interpret EEG signals from other people's brains. This could help us to understand how other people are feeling and thinking, and allow us to communicate more effectively with them.",
    "Tympanism: We could create a new sense that allows us to perceive vibrations in the air, such as those produced by distant quakes or the rustling of leaves. This could help us to better understand the natural world and predict natural disasters more accurately.",
    "Olfactory Synesthesia: We could create a new type of olfactory synesthesia that allows us to perceive odors in a new and creative way. For example, we might be able to perceive smells in colors or shapes, or associate different smells with different emotions or memories."
