    "**Underwater City**: Design an underwater city that can sustain a population of 100,000 people. The city would be shaped like a giant dome, with a transparent outer shell that allows sunlight to penetrate and illuminate the interior. The city would be powered by a combination of solar panels and ocean thermal energy conversion (OTEC) systems. The inhabitants would live in comfortable, high-tech habitats that simulate a terrestrial environment, complete with artificial gravity and a stable atmosphere. The city would also feature advanced life support systems, including air recycling, water purification, and waste management.",
    "**Floating Islands**: Envision a network of floating islands that can support a population of 500,000 people. Each island would be a self-sustaining ecosystem, with its own food production, energy generation, and waste management systems. The islands would be connected by a network of elevated walkways and transportation systems, allowing for easy movement between islands. The islands would be designed to be highly adaptable, with the ability to adjust their size, shape, and orientation in response to changing environmental conditions.",
    "**Space Station**: Design a space station that can support a population of 1 million people. The space station would be a massive, modular structure that can be expanded or contracted as needed. It would feature a range of habitats, including living quarters, research facilities, and recreational areas. The space station would be powered by a combination of solar panels and nuclear reactors, and would have its own life support systems, including air recycling, water purification, and waste management.",
    "**Ecological City**: Imagine a city that is designed to be a living, breathing ecosystem. The city would be shaped like a giant tree, with a central trunk and branching limbs that support a diverse array of habitats and ecosystems. The city would be powered by a combination of solar panels, wind turbines, and bio-energy systems, and would feature advanced life support systems, including air recycling, water purification, and waste management.",
    "**Subterranean City**: Envision a city that is built underground, with a population of 500,000 people. The city would be designed to be highly efficient, with a focus on minimizing energy consumption and maximizing resource utilization. The city would feature advanced life support systems, including air recycling, water purification, and waste management, and would be powered by a combination of geothermal energy and renewable energy sources. The city would also feature a range of unique architectural features, including vast underground caverns and tunnels. </s> [/"
