    "Tactile Differentiation: Without colors, people could rely on tactile differences to distinguish between objects. For instance, objects with different textures could be identified by touch. Rough surfaces like rocks or brick walls could be felt, while smooth surfaces like glass or silk could be identified by their lack of friction. People could also use their sense of touch to identify objects by their shape, size, and weight.",
    "Shape and Symmetry: Objects with unique shapes and symmetries could be used to identify them. For example, a person could recognize a circle by its symmetry and round shape, while a square could be identified by its sharp corners and squared-off edges. Similarly, objects with irregular shapes, like a spoon or a book, could be identified by their unique profiles.",
    "Sound Differentiation: Objects could be identified by the sounds they make. For example, a metal spoon would produce a distinct sound when moved across a surface compared to a wooden spoon. Similarly, objects with different weights or materials could produce different sounds when dropped or moved. People could use their sense of hearing to identify objects based on the unique sounds they make.",
    "Scent Differentiation: Without colors, people could rely on their sense of smell to identify objects. Objects with different scents could be differentiated based on their unique aromas. For instance, a person could recognize a leather bag by its distinctive smell, while a fabric bag could be identified by its lighter, more delicate scent. Similarly, objects with different chemical compositions could be identified by their unique smells.",
    "Magnetic Differentiation: Objects could be identified by their magnetic properties. For example, a magnet could be used to identify metal objects, while non-magnetic objects like wood or plastic could be identified by their lack of magnetism. People could use a magnet to differentiate between objects based on their magnetic properties, even in a black and white world."
