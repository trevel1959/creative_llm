    "**Multi-Functional Pencil**: Design a pencil that includes various tools within its body. For instance, one end could have a standard graphite lead, while the other could feature colored leads or a stylus tip for touchscreen devices. Additionally, it could include a small eraser and a sharpener built into the pencil casing, making it a compact all-in-one writing instrument.",
    "**Eco-Friendly Refillable Pencil**: Develop a pencil made from biodegradable materials that can be refilled with new lead instead of being discarded when it gets too short. The casing could be designed to break down naturally in the environment, and the leads could be made from recycled materials, promoting sustainability while reducing waste.",
    "**Ergonomic Pencil Design**: Create a pencil that is designed specifically for comfort and efficiency. This pencil could have a contoured grip that molds to the userâ€™s fingers, reducing hand fatigue during extended writing sessions. Additionally, it could feature a weighted bottom for better balance, making it easier to control the pencil during intricate tasks.",
    "**Color-Changing Pencil**: Introduce a pencil that changes color based on the pressure applied while writing. This could serve as a visual cue for users to adjust their grip or pressure, promoting better writing habits. For example, the pencil could turn green for light pressure, yellow for moderate pressure, and red for heavy pressure, helping users develop a more controlled writing style.",
    "**Interactive Learning Pencil**: Develop a pencil that incorporates augmented reality (AR) technology. When users write with this pencil, they can point their smartphone or tablet at their notes to see interactive elements pop up, such as animations, videos, or quizzes related to the content they wrote. This would be especially useful for students, making learning more engaging and interactive."
