    "**Solar-Powered Compactor Trash Can**: This trash can would incorporate solar panels on its lid to power a compacting mechanism. When the lid is closed, the compactor compresses the trash, allowing more waste to fit inside. This is especially useful for public spaces, reducing the frequency of waste collection and promoting sustainability.",
    "**Interactive Recycling Guide**: This trash can would have an interactive screen that educates users on proper waste disposal and recycling practices. Users could scan items before throwing them away, and the screen would provide guidance on whether the item is recyclable, compostable, or belongs in the trash. This feature could help improve recycling rates and reduce contamination in recycling bins.",
    "**Odor Neutralizing Technology**: This trash can would use advanced filtration systems and odor-neutralizing technology to eliminate unpleasant smells. Incorporating activated charcoal filters or even a small UV light system could help keep the area around the trash can fresh, making it more appealing for indoor use.",
    "**Biodegradable Trash Bags with Seed Pods**: This innovative trash can would use biodegradable trash bags embedded with seed pods. Once the bag is full and tied off, it can be placed in a compost pile or garden, where the bag decomposes, and the seeds grow into plants. This concept promotes sustainability and encourages users to think about the lifecycle of their waste.",
    "**Multi-Compartment Trash Can**: This trash can would feature multiple compartments for different types of waste (recyclables, compost, general waste, etc.). Each compartment would have its own opening and be color-coded for easy identification. This design encourages proper waste sorting and helps households and offices manage their waste more effectively."
