    "**Environmental Degradation**: High foot traffic in popular areas can lead to soil erosion, damaged vegetation, and littering. To address this, park management could create designated trails and boardwalks to protect sensitive areas. Regular maintenance and the introduction of “Leave No Trace” campaigns can encourage visitors to respect the natural environment. Moreover, implementing a reservation system for high-traffic areas can help manage the number of visitors at any given time.",
    "**Invasive Species Management**: Invasive plant and animal species can threaten native ecosystems within the park. Management strategies could include regular monitoring for invasive species, public education on how to prevent their spread (such as cleaning shoes and gear before entering the park), and active removal programs. Collaborating with local conservation organizations can also enhance efforts to restore native habitats.",
    "**Infrastructure and Accessibility Issues**: Many national parks may struggle with outdated infrastructure, such as restrooms, roads, and visitor centers, which can affect visitor experience and safety. Park management could conduct an assessment of existing facilities and prioritize upgrades based on visitor needs and safety standards. Implementing accessibility features for people with disabilities can also broaden the park's appeal and ensure that all visitors can enjoy the natural beauty.",
    "**Climate Change Impacts**: Climate change can alter ecosystems, leading to shifts in wildlife populations, changes in plant phenology, and increased frequency of extreme weather events. To combat this, park management could engage in climate resilience planning, which involves monitoring changes, adapting park management practices, and promoting research on climate impacts. Public outreach initiatives can also raise awareness about climate change and encourage sustainable practices among visitors.",
    "**Funding and Resource Allocation**: National parks often face budget constraints, which can limit staffing, maintenance, and conservation efforts. To address this, park management could explore alternative funding sources, such as grants, partnerships with local businesses, and crowdfunding campaigns. Developing volunteer programs can also help supplement staff and engage the community in park stewardship, enhancing both resources and visitor experience."
