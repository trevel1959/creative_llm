    "**Multi-Brew Functionality**:    Design a coffee maker that allows for multiple brewing methods in one device. Users can choose between drip coffee, French press, pour-over, or espresso with just a simple switch. Each method could have its own unique water temperature and brewing time settings, which can be customized through a touchscreen interface. This versatility would cater to various coffee enthusiasts and their preferences.",
    "**Self-Cleaning System**:    Incorporate a self-cleaning feature that uses ultrasonic technology to clean the internal components of the coffee maker. After each brew cycle, the machine could initiate a cleaning cycle that uses high-frequency sound waves to remove coffee oils and residues, ensuring optimal performance and taste without the need for manual cleaning.",
    "**Flavor Infuser Chamber**:    Add a detachable flavor infuser chamber where users can place spices, herbs, or flavored coffee beans. During the brewing process, hot water would flow through this chamber, infusing the coffee with unique flavors. This would allow users to experiment with different taste profiles, creating a personalized coffee experience every time.",
    "**Temperature Control with a Heat Retention Feature**:    Introduce a dual-layer thermal carafe that maintains the coffeeâ€™s optimal drinking temperature for hours without the need for a hot plate. Additionally, the coffee maker could feature precise temperature control settings, allowing users to select their desired brewing temperature based on the type of coffee they are using (e.g., lighter roasts may require lower temperatures).",
    "**Interactive Recipe Database**:    Equip the coffee maker with an interactive touchscreen that provides access to a database of coffee recipes. Users can explore different brewing methods, ratios, and flavors from around the world. The machine could guide them step-by-step through the brewing process, making it easy for beginners to experiment with new techniques and flavors."
