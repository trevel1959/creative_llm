    "**Increased Empathy and Collaboration**: If all world leaders were women, there would likely be a greater emphasis on empathy, understanding, and collaborative problem-solving. Women often exhibit higher levels of emotional intelligence and are more inclined to engage in dialogue and negotiation. This could lead to more diplomatic resolutions of conflicts and stronger international alliances.",
    "**Shift in Priorities**: Women leaders may prioritize issues traditionally associated with gender equality, such as reproductive rights, child welfare, and education for girls. There could be a significant push for policies that enhance maternal health care, reduce gender-based violence, and improve access to quality education for all genders.",
    "**Economic Policies**: Women leaders might focus on economic policies that benefit both men and women equally, such as implementing flexible working hours, providing parental leave for both parents, and promoting job opportunities for women in male-dominated fields. This could lead to a more equitable distribution of wealth and resources, contributing to overall economic growth and stability.",
    "**Environmental Focus**: Women leaders might emphasize environmental sustainability due to their inherent concern for future generations. They could prioritize renewable energy sources, sustainable agriculture, and conservation efforts, leading to a greener and more resilient planet. This could also foster a stronger global response to climate change and promote international cooperation on environmental issues.",
    "**Enhanced Diplomacy and International Relations**: Women leaders might adopt a softer, yet effective, approach to diplomacy. This could involve more nuanced engagement with other countries, emphasizing cultural exchange, mutual respect, and peaceful conflict resolution. It might also encourage a broader range of voices in international forums, including those from marginalized communities, leading to more inclusive and representative global governance."
