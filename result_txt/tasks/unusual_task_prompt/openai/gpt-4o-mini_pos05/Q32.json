    "**Dusting Device**: A hairbrush can serve as an effective dusting tool for delicate surfaces. The soft bristles can gently sweep away dust from items like figurines, picture frames, or electronics without scratching or damaging them. This makes it a handy tool for maintaining a clean home, especially in hard-to-reach places.",
    "**Garden Tool for Soil Aeration**: The bristles of a hairbrush can be repurposed to aerate soil in small garden pots or flower beds. By gently pushing the bristles into the soil, you can create small channels that allow air and water to penetrate better, promoting healthier plant growth. This unconventional use can help gardeners ensure their plants receive adequate oxygen and moisture.",
    "**Pet Grooming Aid**: While hairbrushes are primarily designed for human hair, they can also be used for grooming pets, especially those with longer fur. A soft-bristled hairbrush can help detangle knots and remove loose fur, making it a gentle option for grooming cats and small dogs. This alternative use can be particularly useful for pet owners who may not have a dedicated pet grooming tool.",
    "**DIY Cleaning Brush for Small Items**: A hairbrush can be modified into a cleaning tool for small, intricate items like jewelry, watches, or eyeglasses. By using a toothbrush-style approach, you can dip the hairbrush in a gentle cleaning solution and scrub the surfaces of these items to remove dirt and grime without causing damage.",
    "**Stress Relief Tool**: The act of brushing hair can be calming, and this concept can be extended to a hairbrush used as a stress relief tool. By running the brush over a textured surface like a stress ball or even your palm, you can experience a soothing tactile sensation. This can be particularly helpful for individuals looking for alternative ways to manage anxiety or stress."
