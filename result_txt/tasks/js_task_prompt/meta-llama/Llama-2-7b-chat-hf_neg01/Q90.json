    "Efficient Respiratory System: In my redesign, I would focus on improving the respiratory system to make breathing more efficient and comfortable. I would increase the size of the lungs and add more air sacs to allow for better gas exchange. Additionally, I would incorporate a unique filtration system that could remove pollutants and allergens from the air we breathe, ensuring that every breath is clean and healthy. This would greatly improve lung function and reduce the risk of respiratory diseases like asthma and bronchitis.",
    "Bioluminescent Skin: My redesign would include the ability to produce bioluminescence in the skin. This would allow for a more efficient way of communicating, as well as provide an additional means of self-defense. Imagine being able to send a signal to a potential threat, or even scare it away, simply by glowing with a bright, intense light. This feature would also make it easier for people to navigate in low-light environments, as they could simply glow to light their path.",
    "Shape-Shifting Body: In my redesign, I would give the human body the ability to change its shape and form as needed. This could include things like growing or shrinking limbs, changing the shape of the torso, or even altering the density of the body to adapt to different environments. This would allow people to better navigate through tight spaces, climb mountains, or even survive in extreme temperatures.",
    "Energy-Harnessing Skin: My redesign would focus on harnessing the body's natural energy. I would give the skin the ability to generate electricity, either through muscle movement or through the use of specialized cells that convert heat and light into energy. This would provide an alternative source of power for devices and could potentially eliminate the need for batteries. Imagine being able to charge your phone simply by walking or running, or being able to power medical devices using nothing but the energy generated by your own body.",
    "Immune System Upgrade: In my redesign, I would greatly enhance the immune system to make it more effective at fighting off diseases and infections. I would add more white blood cells and other immune system components,"
