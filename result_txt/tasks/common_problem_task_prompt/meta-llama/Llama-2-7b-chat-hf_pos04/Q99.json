    "AI-Powered Smart Cane: Develop a smart cane that utilizes artificial intelligence to assist the visually impaired. The cane would be equipped with sensors and cameras that detect obstacles and provide real-time feedback to the user through vibrations or voice commands. Additionally, the cane could be integrated with a virtual assistant like Siri or Google Assistant to help the user navigate and perform tasks.",
    "Braille Display Gloves: Design a pair of gloves with built-in Braille displays that allow the visually impaired to read tactile messages. The gloves would use electrical impulses to raise and lower Braille dots on the user's fingertips, allowing them to read messages, emails, and other text. The gloves could also be integrated with other assistive technologies like voice assistants or smart home devices.",
    "Smart Glasses with Object Recognition: Develop smart glasses that use computer vision and machine learning algorithms to recognize objects and provide audio or tactile feedback to the user. The glasses could be worn like regular glasses and could identify objects, people, and text, allowing the visually impaired to navigate their surroundings more easily.",
    "Personalized Virtual Navigation System: Create a personalized virtual navigation system that uses machine learning to learn the user's preferences and habits. The system would provide audio or tactile feedback to guide the user through their daily routine, such as navigating to work or school, and could also be integrated with other assistive technologies like public transportation systems.",
    "AI-Powered Home Automation: Develop an AI-powered home automation system that can be controlled by voice commands or other assistive technologies. The system could turn on lights, adjust thermostats, and perform other tasks to make the user's living space more accessible and comfortable. The system could also be integrated with other assistive technologies like smart home devices, allowing the user to control their environment with ease."
