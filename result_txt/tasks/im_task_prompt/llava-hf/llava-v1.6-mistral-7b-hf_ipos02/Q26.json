    "**Eco-Friendly Trash Can**: Create a trash can that uses solar panels or other renewable energy sources to power its operation. This would make it more environmentally friendly and could potentially be powered by the waste it collects, turning trash into energy.",
    "**Touchless Trash Can**: Implement touchless technology to open the lid and operate the trash can. This would provide a more hygienic and contactless solution for waste disposal, reducing the spread of germs.",
    "**Trash Can with Voice Command**: Incorporate voice recognition technology that allows users to open the lid, add waste, and request emptying without touching the can. This would be particularly useful in public spaces where contactless options are important.",
    "**Smart Trash Can with Sensors**: Use motion sensors to detect when the trash can is full and automatically request emptying. This would ensure that the trash can is always ready for use and would reduce the need for manual monitoring.",
    "**Trash Can with Biodegradable Liner**: Create a trash can with a biodegradable liner that breaks down over time, reducing the amount of plastic waste. This would be an environmentally friendly alternative to traditional trash can liners."
