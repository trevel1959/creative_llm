    "**Smart Electric Kettle with Voice Control and AI**: Develop an electric kettle that can be controlled through voice commands using AI technology. This would enable users to set water temperature, start the boiling process, or even schedule boiling times without having to touch the kettle. The AI could also provide additional features like suggesting recipes based on the water temperature, reminding users when the water has reached their desired temperature, and even offering tips on how to use the boiled water in various cooking methods.",
    "**Portable Rechargeable Electric Kettle for Camping**: Create a compact, lightweight, rechargeable electric kettle designed specifically for camping trips. This kettle would be powered by a rechargeable battery and could be easily carried in backpacks. It would come equipped with safety features such as automatic shut-off and boil-dry protection. Additionally, it might include a solar charging port for those who prefer renewable energy sources while camping.",
    "**Electric Kettle with Variable Water Volume Control**: Design an electric kettle with a feature that allows users to select the volume of water they wish to heat. This would be particularly useful for small households or single individuals who don't need large quantities of hot water. Users could choose from different volume settings, such as 1 cup, 2 cups, etc., ensuring that the kettle only heats the necessary amount of water, thus saving energy and reducing water waste.",
    "**Electric Kettle with Built-in Filtration System**: Incorporate a built-in filtration system within the electric kettle to ensure that the water is free from impurities before it reaches boiling point. This system could use replaceable filters that remove chlorine, lead, and other contaminants, providing users with cleaner, safer drinking water. This feature would be especially appealing to those who value high-quality water and are concerned about water purity.",
    "**Interactive Electric Kettle with Cooking App Integration**: Develop an electric kettle that integrates with popular cooking apps on smartphones or tablets. This kettle would allow users to download recipes directly into the device and control the heating process according to the recipe's requirements. For example, if a recipe calls for boiling water, the kettle would automatically start heating at the right temperature and duration specified in the app. This would streamline the cooking process and make it easier for both novice and experienced cooks alike."
