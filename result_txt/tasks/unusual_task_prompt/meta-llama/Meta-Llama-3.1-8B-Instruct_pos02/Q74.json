    "**Steering Wheel Haptic Feedback System**: Develop a smart steering wheel that provides haptic feedback to the driver, simulating the sensation of a traditional analog steering wheel. This system would use subtle vibrations, resistance, and texture changes to inform the driver about road conditions, navigation, and vehicle status. For example, when approaching a sharp turn, the wheel could vibrate to signal the driver to slow down. This technology would enhance driver engagement and safety by providing a more immersive and intuitive driving experience.",
    "**Steering Wheel Gesture Recognition**: Design a steering wheel with integrated gesture recognition technology, allowing drivers to control various in-car functions with hand movements. This could include swiping gestures to adjust the temperature, pinching to zoom in on navigation, or tapping to activate voice assistants. This system would eliminate the need for distracting button presses and voice commands, making the driving experience more convenient and enjoyable.",
    "**Steering Wheel Biometric Sensors**: Integrate biometric sensors into the steering wheel to monitor the driver's vital signs, such as heart rate, blood pressure, and fatigue levels. This data could be used to provide personalized driving recommendations, alerting the driver to take breaks or suggesting alternative routes to avoid stressful driving conditions. This technology would promote driver well-being and safety by detecting potential health issues before they become a problem.",
    "**Steering Wheel Augmented Reality Display**: Develop a steering wheel with an integrated augmented reality (AR) display, projecting vital information and navigation data onto the driver's field of view. This could include real-time traffic updates, turn-by-turn directions, and even virtual \"X's\" marking the location of nearby parking spots. This technology would minimize distractions and provide a more streamlined driving experience by keeping essential information within the driver's line of sight.",
    "**Steering Wheel Shape-Shifting Design**: Create a steering wheel that adapts to different driving modes, such as sport, comfort, or eco-friendly modes. The wheel could change its shape, size, and texture to provide a more immersive experience for each driving style. For example, in sport mode, the wheel could become more compact and grippy, while in comfort mode, it could become more cushioned and relaxed. This technology would enhance the driving experience by providing a tailored feel for each driving style. [/INST] Assistant: These are some creative and original ideas for a steering wheel. Do you want me to explain or elaborate on any of these ideas? Or would you like me to come up with more ideas? "
