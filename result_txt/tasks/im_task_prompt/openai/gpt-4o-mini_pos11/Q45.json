    "**Modular Blade Design**: Introduce a modular blade system that allows users to customize the number, shape, and material of the fan blades. This would enable homeowners to adapt their ceiling fan to their specific aesthetic preferences and room size. For example, users could switch to wider blades for larger rooms or colorful blades to match seasonal decor, promoting versatility and personal expression.",
    "**Integrated Lighting and Ambiance Features**: Create a ceiling fan with built-in LED lighting that changes color based on the time of day or mood settings. The fan could include adjustable brightness and color temperature, allowing users to switch from bright, energizing light during the day to warm, relaxing tones in the evening. This feature could be controlled via a smartphone app or voice commands, enhancing both functionality and ambiance.",
    "**Whisper-Quiet Technology**: Innovate a new motor and blade design that significantly reduces noise levels, making the ceiling fan whisper-quiet. This could be particularly appealing for bedrooms or home offices where noise can be a distraction. By using advanced materials and engineering techniques, the fan could operate silently while still providing powerful airflow.",
    "**Air Purification Feature**: Integrate a compact air purification system into the ceiling fan. The fan could include a HEPA filter and an ionizer to clean the air as it circulates. This would not only improve air quality but also eliminate odors, allergens, and pollutants, making it a dual-purpose appliance that enhances both comfort and health in the home.",
    "**Interactive Control Panels**: Design ceiling fans with built-in touch control panels on the fan body or remote control that allow users to adjust settings with a simple swipe or tap. These panels could display real-time information, such as room temperature, air quality, and fan speed, as well as offer presets for different modes (e.g., \"sleep,\" \"party,\" \"eco\"). This interactive feature would modernize the user experience and make adjustments more intuitive."
