    "Use natural predators: If all animals disappeared, we could use natural predators like birds, bats, and certain insect-eating fish to control insect populations. For example, birds and bats feed on insects like mosquitoes, flies, and moths, while certain fish like trout and bass feed on insects like crayfish and snails.",
    "Implement biological control: Biological control is a method of controlling pests by introducing natural enemies of the pest into the environment. For example, we could introduce ladybugs, lacewings, and other predatory insects that feed on aphids, spider mites, and other common garden pests.",
    "Use botanical pesticides: Certain plants produce natural chemicals that are toxic to insects. We could use these botanical pesticides to control pests like aphids, whiteflies, and scale insects. For example, chrysanthemums contain a compound called pyrethrin that is toxic to insects.",
    "Implement integrated pest management: Integrated pest management is a holistic approach to pest control that involves using a combination of methods to control pests. For example, we could use biological control, botanical pesticides, and cultural practices like removing debris and using row covers to reduce the number of pests in the environment.",
    "Use genetic modification: We could genetically modify plants to produce natural insecticides or make them resistant to pests. For example, we could engineer tomato plants to produce a protein that is toxic to whiteflies, or make them resistant to spider mites. However, this method is still in the early stages of development and has not yet been widely adopted."
