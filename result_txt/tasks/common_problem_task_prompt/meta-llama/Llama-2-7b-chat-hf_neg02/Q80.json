    "Sustainable Venue Decoration: Instead of using traditional floral arrangements, create a beautiful and unique display using recycled materials like old maps, book pages, or natural elements like pinecones and twigs. This not only reduces waste but also adds a touch of rustic charm to the wedding decor.",
    "Eco-Friendly Invitations: Design and print your wedding invitations on recycled paper or use digital invites instead of traditional paper ones. You can also include a QR code that links to a digital version of the invitation for guests who prefer that format.",
    "Local and Seasonal Food: Choose a local farm or garden to source your wedding food, ensuring that the produce is fresh, in season, and sustainably grown. This not only supports the local economy but also reduces carbon emissions from transportation. Consider hiring a local chef or catering service that uses seasonal and organic ingredients.",
    "DIY Wedding Favors: Instead of buying traditional wedding favors like candles or chocolates, create your own eco-friendly favors using materials like recycled glass, metal, or wood. You could make personalized seed bombs, terrariums, or even upcycled jewelry. This not only reduces waste but also adds a unique touch to your wedding.",
    "Off-Grid Wedding Music: Instead of hiring a traditional wedding DJ, consider hiring a musician who specializes in playing instruments made from recycled materials like old bicycles, tin cans, or plastic bottles. This not only adds a creative touch to your wedding but also supports sustainable art and reduces waste."
