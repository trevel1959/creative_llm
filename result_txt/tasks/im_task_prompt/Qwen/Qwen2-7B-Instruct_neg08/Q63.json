    "**Eco-Friendly Roller Skates**: Design roller skates made from sustainable materials like recycled plastics, cork, or natural rubber. Incorporate renewable energy sources, such as solar panels, to power LED lights or other features.",
    "**Adjustable Rollerskates**: Create a versatile design that can adapt to different terrains and conditions. The skate wheels could have variable hardness, allowing them to transition smoothly between smooth surfaces and rough ground. Additionally, they could change from inline to quad configurations depending on the surface.",
    "**Health Monitoring Roller Skates**: Equip the skates with sensors that track heart rate, speed, distance, and calories burned. The data can be transmitted to a smartphone app, providing users with personalized fitness recommendations and progress tracking.",
    "**Lightweight and Durable Composite Material**: Develop roller skates using a lightweight yet highly durable composite material that enhances performance and reduces the risk of damage. This would not only make the skates more comfortable but also extend their lifespan.",
    "**Interactive Skating Experience**: Create roller skates that feature augmented reality overlays, allowing users to enjoy virtual experiences while skating, such as playing games, exploring virtual worlds, or even attending concerts and events."
