    "**Language Barriers**: Language differences can hinder effective communication, leading to misunderstandings or misinterpretations of key messages. To address this, the summit could provide professional interpreters and real-time translation services. Additionally, providing written materials in multiple languages ahead of time can ensure that all participants have a clear understanding of the agenda and discussion points.",
    "**Logistical Challenges**: Coordinating travel, accommodations, and venue arrangements for international delegates can be complex. Issues such as flight cancellations, visa delays, or venue accessibility could arise. To combat this, a dedicated logistics team should be established to handle travel itineraries, accommodation bookings, and venue setup, with contingency plans in place for potential disruptions.",
    "**Differing Political Agendas**: Participants may arrive with conflicting political agendas, making it challenging to reach a consensus on peace initiatives. To foster collaboration, the organizing committee could facilitate pre-summit discussions among key stakeholders to identify common ground and set the stage for constructive dialogue during the summit.",
    "**Security Concerns**: Given the nature of a peace summit, there may be security threats from extremist groups or individuals opposed to the discussions. To ensure the safety of all attendees, a comprehensive security plan should be developed, involving local law enforcement, private security firms, and emergency response teams. This plan should include thorough vetting of attendees and secure transportation arrangements.",
    "**Resource Allocation**: Limited funding or resources could impact the quality and effectiveness of the summit. To address this, the organizing committee could seek sponsorships from corporations, NGOs, and government agencies, as well as create a crowdfunding campaign to ensure that all necessary resources are available for a successful event."
