    "**Trash Can Time Capsule**: Create a unique time capsule by filling a trash can with items that represent the current era, such as old smartphones, CDs, and newspapers. Add a note with a message to future generations, highlighting the significance of the items included. Bury the trash can in a designated area, such as a park or a community garden, to serve as a quirky reminder of the past.",
    "**Waste-to-Wealth**: Develop a sustainable business model that transforms trash into valuable products. For instance, collect plastic bottles and turn them into fashionable jewelry, or upcycle old cardboard boxes into planters for indoor plants. Partner with local businesses to create a closed-loop system where waste is converted into revenue-generating products.",
    "**Trash Can Terrarium**: Design an interactive art installation that utilizes a trash can as the centerpiece. Fill the can with a miniature ecosystem, complete with tiny plants, rocks, and small figurines. Add a digital component, such as a LED light show or a soundscape, to create an immersive experience. This installation can be displayed in public spaces or galleries to raise awareness about waste management.",
    "**Trash-to-Treasure**: Organize a community-driven project where people are encouraged to create art pieces using discarded materials. Collect trash from local neighborhoods and host workshops where participants can transform the waste into unique art pieces. Showcase the artwork in a public exhibition, and donate a portion of the proceeds to support environmental initiatives.",
    "**The Great Trash Migration**: Create an immersive theater experience that explores the journey of trash from its creation to its eventual disposal. Use a combination of puppetry, projection mapping, and live performance to recreate the life cycle of trash. The performance can be staged in a unique venue, such as an abandoned warehouse or a public park, to emphasize the connection between waste and the environment.
