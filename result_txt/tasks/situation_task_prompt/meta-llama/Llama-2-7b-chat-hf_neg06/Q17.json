    "Build a Solar-Powered Generator: Create a portable and self-sustaining generator that harnesses the power of the sun to provide electricity. This can be achieved by using a combination of solar panels, batteries, and a small gasoline-powered generator. The solar panels would charge the batteries during the day, and the generator would provide backup power at night or during periods of low sunlight.",
    "Create a Composting Toilet System: Develop a composting toilet system that converts human waste into a nutrient-rich fertilizer. This system would use a combination of natural microorganisms and heat to break down waste, reducing the need for water and creating a valuable fertilizer. The compost can be used to fertilize crops, gardens, or even serve as a natural pest repellent.",
    "Build a Rainwater Collection System: Design a rainwater collection system that captures and stores rainwater for various uses. This system could include a series of gutters and downspouts that direct rainwater into a large storage tank. The water can be used for drinking, irrigation, and other non-potable purposes.",
    "Create a Natural Cooling System: Develop a natural cooling system that utilizes the earth's natural temperature and humidity to regulate indoor temperatures. This system could involve the use of large rocks, soil, and plants to absorb and release heat, creating a cooler and more comfortable indoor environment.",
    "Develop a Wind-Powered Water Purification System: Create a wind-powered water purification system that uses the energy of the wind to purify water. This system could involve the use of a wind-powered turbine to generate electricity, which is then used to power a water purification system. The purified water can be stored in a tank for later use, providing a reliable source of clean drinking water."
