    "**Eco-Friendly Perfume Bottle Design**:    - **Idea**: Create a perfume bottle that is not only visually appealing but also environmentally friendly. This could be achieved by using biodegradable or recyclable materials for the bottle's construction. For example, the bottle could be made from bamboo or other plant-based plastics. The cap might use natural rubber or cork.",
    "**Interactive Perfume Bottle**:    - **Idea**: Develop a perfume bottle that includes interactive technology. For example, the bottle could be equipped with an LED display that changes color based on the fragrance inside. Or, it might have a QR code that users can scan to access a digital experience, like a story related to the fragrance or its creation process.",
    "**Perfume Subscription Service in a Bottle**:    - **Idea**: Create a refillable perfume bottle that comes with a subscription service, allowing customers to choose different fragrances each month. This would involve setting up an online platform where customers can select their preferred scents, and the bottles are sent directly to their doorstep.",
    "**Perfume Bottle as Artistic Expression**:    - **Idea**: Offer custom, hand-painted perfume bottles as part of a high-end collection. Each bottle could be designed by renowned artists or designers, turning the perfume into a piece of art that can be displayed as decor rather than simply used.",
    "**Perfume Bottle as a Multi-Sensory Experience**:    -"
