    "**Aqua Polo**: A variation of traditional polo played on a floating platform in the ocean. Instead of riding on horseback, players would scuba dive or snorkel, using flippers to propel themselves around the field. The ball would be a modified sports ball designed to remain buoyant in water, and the objectives would be to score by hitting it through the opposing team's goalposts.",
    "**Airball Tennis**: A new take on tennis, where the court would be built on a large floating platform in the ocean or a large open body of water. Instead of rackets, players would use tridents to hit an inflatable ball that is lighter and can be manipulated to move at high speeds over the water surface. The game would involve hitting the ball to land it on the other side of the court.",
    "**Dragon Boat Racing**: A team sport involving teams of paddlers racing each other on giant inflatable platforms in the water. Players would propel the boat forwards by paddling in unison, using synchronized techniques similar to those used in dragon boat racing. The objective would be to reach the finish line first, with teams competing against each other to be the fastest.",
    "**Gravity Golf**: A golf-like game played on floating platforms in large bodies of water. Instead of using clubs, players would use water skis or small surfboards to glide across the water and hit a floating ball towards the target. The landscape of the floating platforms would include natural or artificial obstacles like hills and valleys, adding an element of strategy and precision.",
    "**Magnetic Ball**: A fast-paced game where the objective is to catch a ball that is magnetized to a ring in the center of the court. Two teams would compete against each other by launching the ball towards their opponents, who must then use their agility and reflexes to catch it. The team that successfully captures the ball and returns it to the center earns a point."
