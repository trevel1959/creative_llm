    "**Thermal Management Problems**: New builders often underestimate the importance of cooling solutions. Without adequate cooling, the CPU and GPU can overheat, leading to performance throttling or even hardware damage. Builders should consider investing in quality thermal paste, aftermarket coolers, and case fans. An original idea is to create a temperature monitoring system using a Raspberry Pi to track the temperatures in real-time and adjust fan speeds accordingly.",
    "**Static Electricity Damage**: Static discharge can damage sensitive computer components. New builders might forget to take precautions against static electricity, leading to potential failures of parts like the motherboard or RAM. To combat this, a creative solution would be to create a DIY anti-static wrist strap using common materials, or even design a static-free workstation using conductive mats and grounding points.",
    "**Cable Management Chaos**: Poor cable management can lead to airflow issues and a cluttered build thatâ€™s difficult to troubleshoot. New builders may not plan for cable routing, resulting in a messy interior that could hinder performance. A solution could be to design a cable management guide that includes color-coded cables and pre-defined routing paths to streamline the process and maintain a clean aesthetic.",
    "**Software Installation and Driver Confusion**: After physically assembling the computer, users often struggle with installing the operating system and drivers. This can lead to performance issues or hardware not functioning correctly. To ease this process, a comprehensive installation checklist could be developed, complete with video tutorials and troubleshooting tips for common driver issues, ensuring a smoother setup experience.",
    "**Power Supply Miscalculations**: Builders may miscalculate the wattage required for their power supply unit (PSU), leading to instability or failure to power on. This can happen if they underestimate the power needs of components like GPUs or additional peripherals. A creative approach would be to create an online calculator that takes into account not just the wattage but also the efficiency ratings of PSUs to recommend the best option for their specific build."
