    "Smart Umbrella: Develop an umbrella that can detect rain and adjust its shape and size accordingly. The umbrella could have sensors that detect moisture in the air and use AI algorithms to predict when rain is likely to occur. When rain is detected, the umbrella could expand to its maximum size for maximum protection, and contract when the rain subsides.",
    "Glow-in-the-Dark Umbrella: Create an umbrella with a special coating that absorbs light and emits a soft, glowing light in the dark. This would provide a unique and stylish feature for those who enjoy walking or running in the evenings or early mornings. The glow-in-the-dark umbrella could also be a safety feature for those who may find themselves lost or in a dark area.",
    "Personalized Umbrella: Develop an umbrella with a unique and personalized design. The umbrella could have a customizable handle with different colors, shapes, and sizes to match the user's preferences. The umbrella could also have a personalized message or logo printed on it, making it a unique and thoughtful gift for friends or loved ones.",
    "Windproof Umbrella: Create an umbrella that is specifically designed to withstand strong winds. The umbrella could have a reinforced frame and canopy, as well as a special ventilation system that allows air to circulate around the umbrella, preventing it from being blown inside out. This would be particularly useful for those who live in areas with frequent strong winds or who enjoy outdoor activities such as sailing or kayaking.",
    "Waterproof Umbrella: Develop an umbrella that is completely waterproof, allowing users to walk or run in wet conditions without worrying about their umbrella getting wet. The umbrella could have a special coating or membrane that prevents water from penetrating the canopy, and could also have a special mechanism that allows the user to easily open and close the umbrella without getting their hands wet. This would be particularly useful for those who enjoy water sports or who live in areas with frequent rain."
