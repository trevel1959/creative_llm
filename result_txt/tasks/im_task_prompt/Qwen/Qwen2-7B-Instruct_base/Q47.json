    "**Integrating Smart Home Technology**: Create a vacuum cleaner that can be controlled through voice commands or a smartphone app. This could include features like scheduling cleaning sessions, monitoring cleaning progress, receiving notifications when filters need to be replaced, and even adjusting suction power based on the type of floor it's cleaning. The integration of smart home technology would allow for more convenience and customization.",
    "**Air Quality Sensor Integration**: Develop a vacuum cleaner that includes an air quality sensor. This sensor would monitor the air quality in your home and adjust its cleaning intensity accordingly. For example, if the sensor detects high levels of dust or allergens, the vacuum cleaner would increase its suction power to clean more effectively. This would not only improve cleaning efficiency but also enhance the overall health and comfort of the home environment.",
    "**Dust Collection Optimization**: Design a vacuum cleaner with a more efficient dust collection system. Instead of traditional bags, consider using a high-capacity HEPA filter or a reusable bag. This design would minimize the need for frequent filter replacements and reduce waste. Additionally, incorporate an indicator that signals when the filter needs cleaning or replacing, ensuring optimal performance and air quality.",
    "**Automated Cleaning Routes**: Implement a feature that allows the vacuum cleaner to learn and remember the most efficient cleaning routes for your home. By mapping out the layout of your house, the vacuum cleaner can create a cleaning path that maximizes coverage while minimizing unnecessary backtracking. This can save time and energy, making the cleaning process more efficient.",
    "**Wearable Vacuum Cleaning Accessory**: Develop a lightweight, wearable vacuum attachment that can be worn on the wrist or attached to clothing. This accessory would be designed for quick cleaning tasks around the home or office, such as cleaning under furniture or getting rid of small messes without having to carry a full-sized vacuum. It could have a compact motor and a long-lasting battery, making it easy to use for spot cleaning or for those who may find carrying a standard vacuum cumbersome."
