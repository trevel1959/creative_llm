    "**DreamWeaver**: A sleeping bag with a built-in, AI-powered brain-computer interface (BCI) that tracks the user's brain activity during sleep. The BCI uses electroencephalography (EEG) sensors to monitor brain waves and identify patterns associated with different stages of sleep, such as REM and non-REM sleep. Based on this data, the BCI generates a personalized soundtrack that adapts to the user's sleep patterns, creating a soothing and immersive experience. The soundtrack can be a mix of calming music, nature sounds, or even guided meditation, all tailored to the user's specific brain activity.",
    "**SleepSphere**: A sleeping bag with a built-in, inflatable, and translucent dome that creates a cozy, enclosed environment. The dome is equipped with a gentle, pulsing LED light that simulates a sunset, gradually decreasing in intensity to help the user relax and fall asleep. The LED light also changes color to reflect the user's body temperature, providing a subtle visual cue to help them adjust their sleeping position for optimal comfort. The dome's inflatable design allows for easy setup and takedown, making it perfect for camping or travel.",
    "**ChillPad**: A sleeping bag with a built-in, temperature-controlled heating and cooling system. The system uses phase-change materials (PCMs) to absorb and release heat, maintaining a consistent body temperature throughout the night. The ChillPad also features a built-in, vibrating massage function that simulates a gentle, soothing massage, helping to relax the user's muscles and promote deeper sleep. The system is powered by a rechargeable battery, allowing users to take it on the go.",
    "**SnuggleBot**: A sleeping bag with a built-in, robotic arm that provides gentle, soothing pressure to the user's body. The arm is equipped with soft, padded sensors that detect the user's body position and apply gentle pressure to specific areas, such as the shoulders, neck, or lower back. The SnuggleBot also features a built-in, aromatherapy system that releases calming scents, such as lavender or vanilla, to promote relaxation and improve sleep quality.",
    "**DreamTracker**: A sleeping bag with a built-in, augmented reality (AR) display that projects a virtual, 3D environment onto the user's ceiling or walls. The AR display uses a combination of sensors and AI algorithms to track the user's sleep patterns and create a personalized, immersive experience. The display can show calming scenes, such as a peaceful forest or a serene beach"
