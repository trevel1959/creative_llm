    "**Pet Chew Toy**: Tennis balls are a classic for dogs, but they can be transformed into a multi-use pet toy. By cutting a small slit in the ball and inserting treats or kibble, you create a puzzle toy that challenges your pet to figure out how to get the treats out, keeping them entertained and mentally stimulated.",
    "**Hanging Garden Planter**: Use tennis balls as lightweight planters for small herbs or succulents. Cut a small opening on one side, fill it with soil, and plant your chosen greenery. You can hang them from a string or wire to create a fun vertical garden display, adding a pop of color to your space.",
    "**Door Stopper**: A tennis ball can serve as an effective door stopper. Simply cut a slit in the ball and place it against the bottom of a door. The soft, rubbery material will prevent the door from slamming shut, and it adds a quirky touch to your home decor.",
    "**Bumper for Furniture**: Attach a tennis ball to the legs of chairs or tables to prevent scratches on hardwood floors. Simply cut a hole in the ball and slide it over the leg of the furniture. This not only protects your floors but also provides a fun and colorful accent to your furniture.",
    "**Washing Machine Noise Dampener**: Place a couple of tennis balls in your dryer to help reduce noise and improve drying efficiency. The balls will bounce around, separating clothes and preventing them from clumping together, which can lead to faster drying and less wear on your clothes."
