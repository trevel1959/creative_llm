    "Competition from established sports: Another potential problem is the competition from established sports that have a strong following and infrastructure already in place. It may be difficult to gain traction and attract participants and spectators when there are already well-established sports that offer similar benefits and excitement.",
    "Safety concerns: As with any new sport, there may be safety concerns that need to be addressed. This could include the risk of injury from new or untested equipment, the potential for collisions or accidents, and the need for proper safety protocols and training for participants.",
    "Lack of standardization: Without established rules and regulations, there may be confusion and inconsistencies in how the sport is played, which could lead to disputes and conflicts among participants and organizations.",
    "Difficulty in finding a niche: With so many sports already existing, it may be challenging to find a unique niche or angle that sets the new sport apart and makes it stand out from the competition. This could make it difficult to attract participants and spectators.",
    "Challenges in marketing: Marketing a new sport can be a difficult task, especially if there is no established brand or reputation to build upon. It may be challenging to generate interest and excitement for a sport that is completely new to people."
