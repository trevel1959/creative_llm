    "Learn and teach: With no one else to teach or learn from, I would focus on expanding my knowledge on all subjects. I would teach myself through self-study, experimentation, and research. I would also create educational materials for myself to learn from and use them to teach myself new skills.",
    "Create art and music: Without an audience, I would focus on creating art and music for the sake of self-expression. I would write stories, draw, paint, and compose music, all as a way to process my thoughts and emotions.",
    "Build a time capsule: I would gather essential items from my surroundings and create a time capsule to be opened in the future. This could include tools, seeds, books, and personal items that would give future generations a glimpse into my life and the world as it once was.",
    "Travel and explore: I would travel to every continent, visiting every landmark and experiencing every culture. I would document my journeys and create a travel journal that could be passed down through generations.",
    "Develop new technology: Without the influence of other people, I would focus on developing new technology to improve the world. I would experiment with materials, create new machines, and come up with innovative solutions to problems."
