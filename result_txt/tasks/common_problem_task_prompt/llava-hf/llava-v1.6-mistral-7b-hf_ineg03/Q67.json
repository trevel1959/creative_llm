    "**Weather Dependency**: Organic farming is highly dependent on favorable weather conditions, which can be unpredictable. Droughts, floods, or extreme weather events can severely impact crop production and make it difficult to maintain a consistent income stream.",
    "**Pest and Disease Control**: Organic farming relies on natural methods to control pests and diseases, which can be less effective than chemical treatments. This can lead to crop losses and a need for constant vigilance to prevent infestations.",
    "**Market Fluctuations**: The organic market can be volatile, with prices for organic products fluctuating based on supply and demand. This can make it difficult for farmers to predict their income and plan for the future.",
    "**Labor Intensive**: Organic farming often requires more labor than conventional farming, due to the need for manual weed control, crop rotation, and other manual tasks. This can lead to higher labor costs and make it difficult to scale up production.",
    "**Soil Degradation**: Over time, organic farming can lead to soil degradation if not properly managed. This can result in a decline in soil fertility and a decrease in crop yields."
