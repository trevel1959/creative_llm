    "Add Smart Technology: The next idea is to incorporate smart technology into the suitcase to make it more convenient and efficient. For example, the suitcase could have built-in scales that allow you to weigh your luggage without having to remove it from the suitcase. This would be especially useful when traveling to countries with strict weight restrictions, as you could easily check your luggage's weight without having to guess or weigh it at a airport counter. Additionally, the suitcase could have built-in charging ports for your devices, so you could charge your phone or laptop on the go without having to worry about running out of power.",
    "Customizable Compartments: Another idea is to add customizable compartments to the suitcase to make it more organized and easy to use. For instance, the suitcase could have removable and interchangeable dividers that allow you to create different compartments for different types of items, such as clothes, toiletries, or electronics. This would make it easier to find what you need quickly and easily, without having to dig through the entire suitcase. Additionally, the suitcase could have a built-in laundry bag or a shoe bag that can be easily removed and replaced, making it easier to pack and unpack.",
    "Collapsible Design: The next idea is to design the suitcase with a collapsible or foldable design, which would make it easier to store and transport. For instance, the suitcase could be made with a series of interlocking panels that can be easily folded and stored in a smaller space, such as a closet or under a bed. This would be especially useful for people who travel frequently and need to store their suitcase in a small space when they're not using it.",
    "Multi-Purpose Design: Another idea is to design the suitcase with a multi-purpose design that allows it to serve multiple functions. For example, the suitcase could have a built-in backpack straps that allow you to wear it like a backpack, making it easier to carry when you're traveling long distances. Additionally, the suitcase could have a built-in cooler or insulated compartment that can be used to keep drinks or medications cool or cold, depending on your needs.",
    "Modular Design: The next idea is to design the suitcase with a modular design that allows you to easily customize and upgrade it as needed. For instance, the suitcase could be made with interchangeable components, such as wheels, handles, or compartments, that can be easily swapped out as needed. This would allow you to upgrade or customize your suitcase to suit your specific needs and preferences, without having to buy a completely new one."
