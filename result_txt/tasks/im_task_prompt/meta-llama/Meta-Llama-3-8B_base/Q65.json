    "Electric Kettle",
    "Add a sensor to detect the temperature of the water and automatically turn off the kettle when the water reaches a desired temperature. This would be especially useful for people who are not familiar with the boiling point of water and need a consistent temperature for their tea or coffee.",
    "Create a smart kettle that can be controlled remotely through an app. This would allow users to turn the kettle on or off from their phone or smartwatch, as well as set the desired temperature and time. This would be useful for people who are often on the go and need to make a cup of tea or coffee quickly.",
    "Incorporate a built-in water filter into the kettle. This would remove impurities from the water, making it safer and healthier to drink. It would also reduce the amount of plastic waste generated by disposable water filters.",
    "Design a kettle that can be used as a diffuser for essential oils. This would allow users to add a few drops of their favorite essential oil to the water and enjoy the benefits of aromatherapy while they drink their tea or coffee."
