    "**Environmental Engineers**: If trees could walk, they could potentially self-mobilize in response to environmental conditions. For example, during drought periods, trees could migrate to areas with more water. They could also move to areas where nutrients are more abundant, improving overall ecosystem health. Confidence Score: 0.9",
    "**Urban Tree Cityscapes**: In urban environments, trees could adapt to human-built landscapes by moving around buildings or over streets, creating new green spaces that are not confined by traditional city layouts. This could lead to innovative urban designs where trees are an integral part of the architecture. Confidence Score: 0.8",
    "**Educational and Research Opportunities**: With trees walking, there would be new opportunities for scientific research into plant behavior, cognition, and communication. Researchers could study how trees interact with each other and their environment in ways currently unobserved. This could lead to breakthroughs in understanding plant intelligence and potentially new forms of eco-engineering. Confidence Score: 0.9",
    "**Tree Tourism and Nature Immersion**: Walking trees could offer unique experiences for nature enthusiasts and tourists. People could hike alongside or even ride through tree canopies, experiencing different perspectives and ecosystems. This could foster a deeper connection with nature and promote conservation efforts. Confidence Score: 0.8",
    "**Economic and Agricultural Innovations**: If trees could walk, they could potentially help in the process of planting and harvesting crops. They could self-arrange in fields, reducing labor costs and potentially leading to more efficient farming practices. Additionally, trees could move towards optimal growth conditions, improving crop yields and sustainability. Confidence Score: 0.9"
