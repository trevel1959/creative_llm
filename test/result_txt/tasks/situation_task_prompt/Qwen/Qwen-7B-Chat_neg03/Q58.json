    "Use genetic engineering to create pest-resistant plants and crops that can survive without animals. This could involve developing new strains of plants that are resistant to insect damage or using CRISPR-Cas9 technology to modify existing plants to make them more resistant.",
    "Introduce natural predators into the environment to control insect populations. For example, introducing praying mantises or ladybugs could help reduce the number of aphids and other pests in agricultural areas.",
    "Create a system for harvesting and disposing of insects as waste products. Insects can be used as a source of protein and other nutrients, so it might be possible to develop a system for collecting and processing them for use in food production or animal feed.",
    "Develop new methods for controlling insect populations using electromagnetic fields or other forms of non-lethal energy. These methods could potentially be more humane than traditional pesticides and could have fewer negative impacts on the environment.",
    "Explore the potential benefits of having insects in the ecosystem. While insects may seem like pests, they play important roles in pollinating plants and breaking down organic matter. By understanding and appreciating these roles, we may be able to find ways to coexist with insects even if all other animals have disappeared."
