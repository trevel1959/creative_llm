    "\"SkyFarm\": A habitat built vertically, utilizing the vertical space of trees and other tall plants. This would create a network of interconnected \"sky farms\" that could be used for agriculture, housing, and even observation decks, providing a unique perspective of the surrounding landscape.",
    "\"Biodome Oasis\": A large, geodesic, transparent dome that could house a variety of plant and animal species, simulating a natural ecosystem within an urban setting. The dome would be equipped with climate control systems and energy-efficient lighting to maintain a healthy environment for the inhabitants.",
    "\"BioBridge\": A series of interconnected, floating platforms that would serve as a habitat for marine life, connecting isolated ecosystems and providing safe passage for migrating species. The platforms would be designed with natural materials and would include features like artificial reefs and nesting sites.",
    "\"Migratory Metropolis\": A habitat designed to accommodate the migratory patterns of birds and other species. The habitat would consist of a series of interconnected, modular structures that could be moved and reassembled seasonally, following the migratory routes of the species it serves.",
    "\"EcoForest\": A habitat that mimics the structure of a forest ecosystem, with tall trees, underbrush, and diverse plant life. The habitat would be designed to provide a rich ecosystem for wildlife, with built-in features like water retention systems, carbon sequestration, and natural pest control."
