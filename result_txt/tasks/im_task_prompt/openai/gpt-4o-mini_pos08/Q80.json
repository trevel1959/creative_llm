    "**Self-Cleaning Whisk**: Imagine a whisk made from a special material that can be activated to clean itself. By simply placing it in water and pressing a button, the whisk would generate ultrasonic waves that break down food particles and bacteria, leaving it spotless without any scrubbing. This would save time and ensure hygiene in the kitchen.",
    "**Adjustable Whisk Head**: This whisk would have interchangeable heads that can be adjusted based on the desired consistency. For example, users could switch between a standard balloon whisk for aerating and a flat whisk for sauces, or even a spiral whisk for emulsifying. The adjustable mechanism would allow for easy swapping and secure locking, making it versatile for different culinary tasks.",
    "**Ergonomic Multi-Grip Whisk**: This whisk would feature a handle designed for multiple grip positions, allowing users to hold it comfortably whether they are whisking vigorously or gently folding ingredients. The handle could be made from a soft, non-slip material and have grooves that guide the fingers into optimal positions for comfort and control, reducing strain during prolonged use.",
    "**Whisk with Integrated Recipe Guide**: This innovative whisk would come equipped with a small digital screen that displays recipes and step-by-step instructions while you cook. The screen could be touch-sensitive, allowing users to scroll through recipes, adjust serving sizes, and even set timers, all while keeping their hands free for whisking.",
    "**Color-Changing Whisk**: Utilizing heat-sensitive or pH-sensitive materials, this whisk would change color based on the temperature or acidity of the mixture. For example, it could turn blue when the mixture reaches a certain temperature, indicating it's ready for the next step, or change colors based on the pH level, helping bakers know when to adjust ingredients for optimal results."
