    "Mindfulness and self-reflection: Recognize and acknowledge your feelings of jealousy, but instead of letting them consume you, take a step back and reflect on why you feel that way. Identify any unrealistic expectations or beliefs that may be contributing to your jealousy. Practice mindfulness techniques to help manage your emotions and cultivate a more balanced perspective.",
    "Reframe your thinking: Challenge the belief that everyone else is more productive or capable than you. Instead, focus on your own strengths and accomplishments. Celebrate the small victories and accomplishments you achieve, and recognize that everyone has their own unique path to success.",
    "Set realistic goals and deadlines: Break down larger tasks into smaller, manageable chunks, and set achievable deadlines for yourself. This will help you feel a sense of accomplishment and progress, which can help reduce feelings of jealousy.",
    "Practice gratitude: Make a conscious effort to focus on the things you are grateful for, rather than dwelling on what others have achieved. Keep a gratitude journal, write thank-you notes, or share your gratitude with a friend or family member.",
    "Create a support network: Surround yourself with people who inspire and motivate you, rather than comparing yourself to them. Share your goals and aspirations with a trusted friend or mentor, and ask for their support and encouragement. This can help you stay accountable and motivated, and reduce feelings of jealousy."
