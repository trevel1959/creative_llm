    "**Truthful Journalism**: Imagine a world where journalists have the ability to make their interviewees tell the truth without any filters or lies. This could revolutionize the way news is reported, ensuring that the public receives accurate and unbiased information. The journalist could employ this power by carefully choosing who to interview, focusing on key figures in politics, business, and other influential areas. This would not only expose corruption but also help in promoting transparency and accountability in society.",
    "**Conflict Resolution**: In situations of conflict, such as disputes between nations, individuals, or communities, the ability to make people tell the truth could be incredibly useful. By having leaders or disputants reveal their true intentions and emotions, it might be possible to understand each other better, leading to more effective communication and potentially resolving conflicts without violence.",
    "**Psychological Therapy**: For therapists, this ability could offer a unique approach to helping patients confront and overcome deep-seated issues. Patients could be encouraged to share their darkest thoughts and feelings, which would facilitate a deeper understanding of their own psyche. This might lead to breakthroughs in treatment, helping patients heal from trauma and mental health disorders more effectively.",
    "**Educational Reform**: In schools, the ability to make students tell the truth about their understanding and feelings towards various subjects could greatly enhance the educational process. Teachers could tailor their methods to better address the specific needs of their students, creating a more engaging and personalized learning experience. This could lead to significant improvements in academic performance and student satisfaction.",
    "**Legal Justice**: In the legal system, this power could significantly impact the fairness and efficiency of trials. Jurors and witnesses could provide unfiltered testimony, ensuring that justice is served based on the truth rather than hidden agendas or misunderstandings. This might reduce the number of wrongful convictions and improve public trust in the judicial system."
