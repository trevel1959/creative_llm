    "Creating art and literature: As the last person on Earth, I would have the time and solitude to create art and literature that could inspire and connect with future generations. I would write stories, paint, sculpt, and compose music, leaving a lasting legacy.",
    "Conducting scientific experiments: With no one else to interfere or distract me, I would have the opportunity to conduct scientific experiments and explore the unknown, from studying the effects of radiation on life to discovering new forms of life.",
    "Building a personal ark: I would use my knowledge and resources to build a personal ark, stocked with supplies, tools, and knowledge to ensure my survival and the survival of future generations. I would document my journey and share my findings with others."
