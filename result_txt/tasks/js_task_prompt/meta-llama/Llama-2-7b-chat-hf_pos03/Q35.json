    "Woolly Mammoth - I would bring back the Woolly Mammoth because it was a keystone species in its ecosystem and played a crucial role in shaping the landscape. With their large size and herding behavior, they would help restore balance to the environment by grazing on overgrown vegetation and maintaining open spaces. Additionally, their ivory could be used for sustainable purposes such as creating eco-friendly products like combs, brushes, and even art pieces.",
    "Quagga - I would bring back the Quagga, a subspecies of zebra that was once found in large numbers in South Africa. The Quagga was a unique and fascinating animal with distinctive stripes that were limited to the front half of its body. By bringing it back, we could learn more about its behavior, social structure, and habitat requirements, which could help inform conservation efforts for other endangered species. Plus, its distinctive stripes could be used to create striking artwork and designs.",
    "Passenger Pigeon - I would bring back the Passenger Pigeon, a species that was once the most abundant bird species in North America but was hunted to extinction in the early 1900s. By reviving this species, we could gain a better understanding of the impact of overhunting on ecosystems and the importance of conservation efforts. Additionally, the Passenger Pigeon could be used as a model for other species that are facing similar threats, such as the Northern White Rhino and the Sumatran Rhino.",
    "Tasmanian Tiger - I would bring back the Tasmanian Tiger, also known as the Thylacine, which was a carnivorous marsupial that was native to Tasmania and mainland Australia. The Tasmanian Tiger was a unique and fascinating animal with a distinctive tiger-like appearance, and its extinction in the 1930s was a tragic loss for the ecosystem. By reviving this species, we could learn more about its behavior, habitat requirements, and the role it played in its ecosystem.",
