    "Sustainable Decor: Another challenge is finding decor items that are eco-friendly and match the desired color scheme and theme. Decorators may rely heavily on single-use plastic products or products that are difficult to recycle. The couple can opt for reusable or biodegradable decorations, such as recycled glass vases or repurposed wooden pallet tables, or create a unique centerpiece that has a low environmental impact.",
    "Food and Catering: At the reception, one of the biggest areas for waste is food and catering. Couples can take steps to reduce this impact by choosing a caterer that uses locally sourced, organic, and seasonal produce and minimizing food waste. Another option is to go for a food-sharing approach, where guests can bring a dish to share.",
    "Transportation and Location: Selecting an eco-friendly wedding location can also be challenging. Couples can choose a venue that is accessible via public transport or a venue that has implemented environmentally friendly practices, such as wind energy or solar power. To further reduce the environmental impact of transportation, the couple can provide guests with eco-friendly travel options, such as carpooling or shuttle services.",
    "Garment and Accessories: Choosing outfits and accessories that match an eco-friendly theme can be difficult, especially when considering the amount of waste generated during the production and disposal of clothing. Couples can opt for sustainable, vintage or second-hand clothing and accessories, or use eco-friendly materials, such as organic cotton or sustainable bamboo.",
    "Waste Management: Ensuring that all waste generated at the wedding is recycled and disposed of properly can be challenging. Couples can hire a waste management company that specializes in event waste and implements an effective recycling system. Alternatively, the couple can ask guests to take their trash with them or arrange for an appropriate recycling facility to be present at the venue."
