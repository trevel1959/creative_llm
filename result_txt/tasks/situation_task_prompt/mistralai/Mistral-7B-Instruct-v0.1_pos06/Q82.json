    "Develop a universal body language system: In the absence of language, we could develop a universal body language system that would allow us to communicate with others. This system could be based on specific gestures and facial expressions that convey meaning, such as, anger, fear, joy, etc.",
    "Use music and sound: We could use music and sound to communicate with others. For example, we could create a system of musical notes that represent specific emotions or ideas. This would require a lot of practice and development, but it could be an effective way to communicate without language.",
    "Develop a universal visual system: We could develop a universal visual system that allows us to communicate with others through pictures and symbols. This could involve creating a set of symbols that represent specific emotions or ideas, and then using these symbols to communicate with others.",
    "Use technology: We could use technology to communicate with others. For example, we could develop a system of digital symbols that represent specific emotions or ideas, and then use this system to communicate with others through digital devices.",
    "Create a new language: Although the question asks how we would communicate if all language disappeared, it is also possible to create a new language. We could work together to develop a new language that is easy to learn and understand, and use this language to communicate with others."
