    "**Built-in Scale and Nutritional Scanner**: Equip the shopping cart with a built-in scale that allows customers to weigh items as they add them to the cart. Additionally, a nutritional scanner can analyze the ingredients and provide health information about the products. This feature would be particularly useful for health-conscious shoppers, enabling them to make informed choices based on their dietary needs.",
    "**Integrated Payment System**: Transform the shopping cart into a mobile payment hub. Shoppers can scan items as they add them to the cart, and when theyâ€™re done, they can pay directly from the cart using a secure mobile payment system. This eliminates the need for checkout lines and streamlines the shopping experience, allowing customers to simply walk out after payment.",
    "**Customizable Compartments**: Design a modular shopping cart with adjustable compartments that can be rearranged or expanded based on the shopper's needs. For instance, a parent with young children could create a section for snacks or toys, while someone shopping for a big family could expand the cart to accommodate larger items. This feature allows for personalization and enhances convenience.",
    "**Eco-Friendly Materials and Design**: Revamp the shopping cart using sustainable materials such as recycled plastics or bamboo. Additionally, incorporate a design that allows for easy disassembly for recycling purposes. This initiative not only appeals to environmentally conscious consumers but also positions the store as a leader in sustainability.",
    "**Interactive Digital Display**: Add an interactive touchscreen display to the shopping cart that provides real-time information, such as current promotions, recipes based on items in the cart, or product reviews. Shoppers can also access loyalty points and rewards directly from the cart, enhancing their shopping experience and encouraging customer engagement."
