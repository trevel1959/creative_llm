    "Smart Tape Dispenser:** Imagine a tape dispenser that connects to a smartphone app via Bluetooth. Users can set reminders for when they need tape for various projects, and the dispenser can even suggest the best type of tape based on the project type. For instance, if you're wrapping a gift, it could recommend decorative tape, while for repairs, it could suggest duct tape. The dispenser could also feature a small built-in scale to measure the amount of tape dispensed, ensuring precision for projects that require specific lengths."
