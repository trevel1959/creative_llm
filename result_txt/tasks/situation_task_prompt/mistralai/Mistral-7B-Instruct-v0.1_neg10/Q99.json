    "If all colors disappeared and everything turned black and white, we would still be able to differentiate between different objects by their shape, texture, size, and the patterns on their surfaces. For example, a circle and a square would still be distinguishable, as would a smooth and rough surface.",
    "We could also differentiate between different objects based on their sound, as different objects produce different sounds when struck or moved. For example, a hollow object would produce a different sound than a solid object.",
    "Another way to differentiate between objects would be through the sense of touch. Different objects would have different textures, which could be felt through touch. For example, a smooth object would feel different than a rough object.",
    "We could also differentiate between objects through their taste. Different objects would have different tastes, which could be tasted when ingested or touched. For example, a sweet object would taste different than a sour object.",
    "Finally, we could differentiate between objects through their smell. Different objects would have different smells, which could be smelled when brought close to the nose. For example, a fragrant object would smell different than a non-fragrant object."
