    "Invent a device that uses infrared technology to create a virtual reflection of the user's face. This device would work by scanning the user's face and creating a 3D model of it, which would then be projected onto a screen in real-time. The user could view the virtual reflection on the screen and adjust the lighting and angle to get a better view of themselves.",
    "Use augmented reality (AR) technology to create a virtual reflection that overlays the user's face onto a real-world surface. This could be done by using a smartphone or tablet with an AR app that scans the user's face and displays it on the screen. The user could then hold the device up to a mirror or other reflective surface and see their reflection in real-time.",
    "Develop a wearable device that uses a camera and a small screen to create a real-time reflection of the user's face. The device could be worn on the user's wrist or forehead and would use a small camera to capture the user's face and a small screen to display the reflection. The user could adjust the lighting and angle to get a better view of themselves.",
    "Create a virtual reality (VR) experience that simulates a mirror. The user could put on a VR headset and be transported to a virtual room with a large mirror on the wall. The user would be able to see their reflection in the mirror and adjust the lighting and angle to get a better view of themselves.",
    "Develop a smart mirror that uses a camera and a screen to create a real-time reflection of the user's face. The smart mirror could be mounted on a wall and would use a camera to capture the user's face and a screen to display the reflection. The user could adjust the lighting and angle to get a better view of themselves, and the mirror could also display additional information such as the time, weather, and news updates."
