    "**Self-Adjusting Leash**: A leash that automatically adjusts its length based on the environment. For instance, in crowded areas, it could shorten to keep the dog close, while in open spaces, it could extend to allow more freedom. This could be achieved using sensors that detect surroundings and a retractable mechanism that adjusts accordingly.",
    "**Reflective and Light-Up Features**: To enhance visibility during nighttime walks, the leash could incorporate reflective materials and built-in LED lights that can be activated by the owner. This would improve safety for both the dog and the owner in low-light conditions, making them more visible to vehicles and other pedestrians.",
    "**Multi-Functional Leash with Built-In Storage**: This leash could come with a small, waterproof compartment for storing essentials like poop bags, treats, or even a small first aid kit. The compartment could be easily accessible and would eliminate the need for carrying additional bags, streamlining walks.",
    "**Ergonomic Handle with Grip Technology**: The handle of the leash could be designed with ergonomic contours and a non-slip grip that conforms to the owner's hand, reducing strain during long walks. It could also include a shock-absorbing mechanism that minimizes the impact on the owner's arm when the dog pulls, enhancing comfort for both parties.",
    "**Interactive Leash with Training Features**: This leash could include built-in sound and vibration features that can be used for training purposes. For example, a gentle vibration or sound could signal the dog to stop pulling or to come back when it strays too far. Owners could customize the alerts based on their training preferences, creating a more interactive experience."
