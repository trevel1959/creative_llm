    "**Socioeconomic Disparities**: Access to immortality might not be equitable. If the discovery is commercially exploited, only the wealthy could afford it, creating a stark divide between the immortal elite and the mortal poor. This disparity could lead to social unrest, as those unable to access immortality may feel disenfranchised and oppressed, potentially igniting movements for equality and justice.",
    "**Cultural and Ethical Shifts**: The concept of life and death is deeply embedded in human culture. Discovering immortality could challenge religious beliefs, traditions, and societal norms. Cultures that value the cycle of life and death might struggle to adapt, leading to a crisis of identity and purpose. Philosophical debates about the meaning of life, the value of experiences, and the nature of existence would become central to human discourse.",
    "**Workforce and Employment Dynamics**: With people living indefinitely, the job market would undergo drastic changes. Individuals might hold the same job for centuries, leading to stagnation in career advancement and innovation. The traditional model of retirement would vanish, as people would not need to stop working. This could result in fewer opportunities for younger generations, creating a cycle of frustration and resentment.",
    "**Health and Aging Research Boom**: The quest for immortality would likely catalyze an unprecedented surge in medical research focused on aging, health maintenance, and disease prevention. This could lead to breakthroughs in regenerative medicine, gene editing, and biotechnology. While this could enhance quality of life, it might also result in ethical dilemmas surrounding genetic modifications and the potential for creating 'designer' humans.",
    "**Psychological Impacts**: Living forever could have profound psychological effects on individuals. The burden of endless existence might lead to existential crises, boredom, and a loss of motivation. People may struggle with relationships, as the dynamics of love, loss, and attachment would change significantly. The fear of outliving loved ones could lead to emotional isolation and mental health challenges."
