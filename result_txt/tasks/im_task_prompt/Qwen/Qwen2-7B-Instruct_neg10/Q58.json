    "**Sound Therapy Hair Dryer**: Incorporate sound therapy features into the hair dryer. The device could emit soothing sounds like ocean waves, rain, or white noise while drying hair, which can help reduce anxiety and make the experience more relaxing for users. Users could choose different soundscapes based on their mood or preference.",
    "**Wearable Hair Dryer Gloves**: Design a pair of gloves that incorporate heating elements, allowing the user to control the temperature with their fingers. These gloves could be worn during the drying process, ensuring that the hair is evenly heated without causing scalp irritation or heat damage. They also provide warmth to the hands, making it easier to handle cold weather.",
    "**Wireless Charging Hair Dryer**: Create a hair dryer that can charge wirelessly when placed on a charging mat. This feature would eliminate the need for cords and make the hair dryer more convenient to use in various settings, such as at the office or while traveling. The charging mat could also double as a sleek, modern decor item in any bathroom.",
    "**Interactive Voice-Command Hair Dryer**: Develop a hair dryer that can be controlled using voice commands. Users could ask the device to change temperatures, direct airflow, or even perform specific drying routines (e.g., \"dry my hair gently\"). This would cater to individuals with disabilities or those who prefer hands-free operation.",
    "**Detachable Detangling Combs**: Attach small, adjustable detangling combs to the back of the hair dryer. These combs would help smooth out tangles while drying, reducing the need for post-drying styling products and minimizing breakage. The combs could also be customized with different attachments for various hair types and textures."
