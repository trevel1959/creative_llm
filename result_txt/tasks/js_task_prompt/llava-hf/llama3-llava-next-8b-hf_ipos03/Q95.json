    "Animal Sanctuary in the Sky: Design a floating sanctuary for birds and other flying animals. The sanctuary would consist of a series of interconnected platforms and artificial habitats that mimic the natural environments of the animals, providing them with a safe and protected space to live.",
    "Aquatic Oasis: Develop a large, interconnected network of underwater habitats for aquatic animals. The habitats would be designed to replicate the natural ecosystems of different species, including coral reefs, kelp forests, and deep-sea environments. The network would also include artificial reefs and waste management systems to promote biodiversity and conservation.",
    "Vertical Forests: Create towering vertical forests that mimic the structure of trees, but with the ability to house a variety of animals. The forests would be designed with different levels for different species, including ground-dwelling animals, birds, and mammals. The buildings would also have integrated solar panels and green roofs for energy efficiency.",
    "Animal Highway: Design a network of tunnels and bridges that connect different animal habitats. The network would allow animals to safely move between habitats without having to cross human-made roads or face other dangers. It would also include monitoring systems to ensure the safety and well-being of the animals.",
    "Biodiversity Boulevard: Create a linear park or pathway that runs through various ecosystems, providing a safe passage for animals to move between habitats. The boulevard would be designed with green spaces, natural barriers, and wildlife corridors to minimize human impact on the animals' migration patterns."
