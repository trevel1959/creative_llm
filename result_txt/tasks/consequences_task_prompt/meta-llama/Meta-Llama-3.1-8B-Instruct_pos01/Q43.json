    "**Neural Library Overload**: With unlimited storage capacity, our brains would become a vast repository of information, but it would lead to information overload. We would struggle to prioritize and recall relevant information, making it difficult to make decisions or take action. Imagine trying to find a specific book in a library with an infinite number of shelves and books â€“ it would be overwhelming. Confidence: 0.8",
    "**Information Distortion**: Unlimited storage would lead to a distortion of information, where our brains would prioritize and alter facts to fit our existing biases and experiences. This would result in a \"memory\" of events that never occurred or a distorted view of reality. It's like having a computer with an infinite amount of storage, but the operating system is corrupted, causing errors and inaccuracies. Confidence: 0.9",
    "**Neural Feedback Loop**: With unlimited storage, our brains would become a feedback loop, constantly replaying and analyzing information, leading to mental fatigue and decreased productivity. It's like having a video on repeat, where you can't stop the playback, and it starts to drive you crazy. Confidence: 0.7",
    "**Information Hoarding**: People would become information hoarders, accumulating and storing vast amounts of useless information, leading to a waste of mental resources. Imagine having a never-ending attic full of useless junk, making it difficult to find what you need. Confidence: 0.6",
    "**Neural Augmentation**: Unlimited storage would allow humans to augment their cognitive abilities, leading to a new era of human evolution. We would be able to process and analyze vast amounts of information, leading to breakthroughs in science, art, and technology. It's like having a supercomputer in your brain, allowing you to solve complex problems and create innovative solutions. Confidence: 0.95"
