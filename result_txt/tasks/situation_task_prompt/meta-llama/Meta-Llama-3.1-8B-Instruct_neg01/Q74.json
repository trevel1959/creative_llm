    "**Water-based Grooming**: I'd focus on water-based products that can be made at home using natural ingredients like coconut oil, olive oil, and essential oils. For example, I could create a moisturizing face mask by mixing together honey, yogurt, and lemon juice. This approach would not only save money but also ensure that I'm using eco-friendly and gentle products on my skin.",
    "**Upcycled Beauty**: I'd repurpose household items to create my own beauty products. For instance, I could use old cotton balls to make a natural exfoliating scrub by mixing them with sugar and olive oil. Alternatively, I could use eggshells to create a natural face mask by grinding them into a fine powder and mixing it with water. This approach would reduce waste and encourage creativity.",
    "**DIY Product Substitutions**: I'd find alternatives to commercial products by substituting ingredients. For example, I could use baking soda as a natural deodorant by mixing it with coconut oil and essential oils. Similarly, I could use apple cider vinegar as a natural hair rinse to balance my scalp's pH. This approach would allow me to maintain my personal grooming habits without relying on commercial products.",
    "**Nature-based Beauty**: I'd focus on using natural ingredients found in nature to maintain my personal grooming habits. For example, I could use aloe vera gel as a soothing face cream, or use charcoal from a BBQ as a natural face mask to detoxify my skin. This approach would not only be cost-effective but also promote a connection with nature.",
    "**Community-based Grooming**: I'd join a community or start a local group where people share knowledge and resources to create their own beauty products. We could exchange recipes, share tips, and collaborate on projects to create a network of DIY beauty enthusiasts. This approach would foster a sense of community and encourage innovation while maintaining personal grooming habits. [/INST] "
