    "Create a Personal Compass: Create a personal compass that uses a magnetic needle to indicate direction. This compass can be made by placing a magnet on a small piece of cardboard and floating it in a bowl of water. As the needle moves, it will align with the Earth's magnetic field, allowing you to determine direction. Confidence Score: 0.8/1",
    "Use the Sun and Stars: Use the position of the sun and stars to determine direction. The sun rises in the east and sets in the west, while the North Star (Polaris) is located in the northern hemisphere and remains stationary. By observing the position of the sun and stars, you can determine direction. Confidence Score: 0.9/1",
    "Follow Animal Trails: Follow the trails of animals such as deer, rabbits, and birds to find direction. These animals have an innate ability to navigate their surroundings and will often leave distinct paths that can be followed to find direction. Confidence Score: 0.8/1",
    "Create a Shadow Clock: Create a shadow clock by using a stick or a long piece of wood to create a shadow on the ground. By observing the position of the shadow at different times of the day, you can determine direction. For example, if the shadow is longest at noon, it means the sun is directly overhead, indicating south. Confidence Score: 0.7/1",
    "Use Landmarks: Use landmarks such as hills, mountains, and rivers to find direction. By observing the position of these landmarks, you can determine direction. For example, if you know the position of a nearby hill, you can use it as a reference point to determine direction. Confidence Score: 0.9/1"
