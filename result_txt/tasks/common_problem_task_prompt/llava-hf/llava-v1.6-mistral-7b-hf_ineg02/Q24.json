    "Language barriers: The language barrier can be a significant hurdle, especially for students who are not fluent in the language spoken at their destination. This could hinder academic work and social integration. To overcome this, hosting families can provide language lessons or facilitate peer tutoring, and students can benefit from using translators or translation apps when needed.",
    "Academic pressures: Adjusting to a different academic system can be challenging for an exchange student. The curriculum, grading system, and pace of learning might differ significantly from what the student is accustomed to. To assist in this, the host family can provide academic support and guidance, coordinate with teachers, and create a study space with the necessary resources at home.",
    "Fear of separation anxiety: Being far from home can be stressful and cause anxiety for the exchange student. Their family, friends, and support systems might not be immediately available, leading to feelings of isolation. To alleviate this, hosting families can provide emotional support and make the exchange student feel like a valued family member. Encourage open communication and make efforts to incorporate the student into family activities and gatherings.",
    "Loneliness: The exchange student might experience loneliness despite being with hosts. As they are away from their home, cultural differences or social dynamics in the host environment can make it challenging to form new friendships or connections. To tackle this, the host family should invite social contacts, arrange group activities with other exchange students, and encourage the student to join school clubs or participate in local community events.",
    "Homesickness: The exchange student might feel homesick and miss their family, friends, and familiar surroundings. The emotional distress caused by this can negatively impact their academic success and overall well-being. To help combat homesickness, hosts should create a positive and welcoming atmosphere, include the student in family life, and allow the student to communicate with their family as much and as often as they desire."
