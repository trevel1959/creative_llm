    "**Bee-Friendly Floral Arrangements**: Incorporate flowers that are known for their nectar-rich qualities to attract bees and other pollinators. This encourages biodiversity and supports local ecosystems. Consider using wildflowers or native plants that require less water and maintenance, reducing environmental impact. You can also plant some of these flowers at the venue after the wedding as a lasting contribution to the local environment.",
    "**Sustainable Transportation**: Encourage guests to use public transportation, carpool, bike, or walk to the wedding venue. Arrange shuttle services from nearby stations if possible. Additionally, consider providing electric or hybrid vehicles for those who need them. The use of biofuels or biodiesel could be another sustainable option for transportation.",
    "**Zero-Waste Food Stations**: Work with caterers who specialize in zero-waste cooking techniques. They can create menus that minimize food waste, often by using seasonal and locally sourced ingredients. Compostable or reusable tableware should be used instead of disposables. Also, consider having a \"take-home\" station where guests can take leftover food items home, reducing waste.",
    "**Eco-Friendly Decorations**: Opt for decorations that are natural, recyclable, or biodegradable. Use live plants, recycled paper, or fabric banners instead of plastic or synthetic materials. Create a \"green wall\" using living plants to decorate the venue, which will not only look beautiful but also provide oxygen and improve air quality.",
    "**Energy-Efficient Lighting**: Use LED lights for all lighting needs as they consume significantly less energy than traditional bulbs. Additionally, incorporate solar-powered lighting, such as lanterns or fairy lights, to add a magical touch while reducing your carbon footprint. For the ceremony and reception, consider using natural light as much as possible during daylight hours."
