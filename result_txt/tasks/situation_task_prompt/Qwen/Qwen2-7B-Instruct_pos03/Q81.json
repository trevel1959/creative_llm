    "**DNA Profiling**: If an individual's DNA is unique to them, it could serve as a means of proving identity. This would require a universal database accessible by authorities, which could match DNA samples against a known profile. This method is highly secure but raises significant privacy concerns.",
    "**Retinal Scans**: The pattern of blood vessels in the retina is also unique to each person and does not change over time. By scanning the retinas of individuals, their identities could be verified instantly. This technology already exists but is currently limited to certain industries and high-security areas.",
    "**Behavioral Biometrics**: This involves analyzing patterns in human behavior, such as typing speed, voice pitch, or even walking style. These patterns are unique to each individual and can be used to verify identity through sensors and software that learn these unique characteristics.",
    "**Personal Artifacts**: Each person may have personal items that they carry around with them regularly (like a watch, wallet, or phone). These artifacts can be used as proof of identity if they are registered under the owner's name. However, this method relies heavily on the individual's adherence to carrying these items at all times.",
    "**Memory Challenges**: Designing a series of memory-based questions that only the individual would know the answers to can also be a method of proving identity. These questions could be related to specific life events, personal preferences, or other unique knowledge only the individual would possess. This method requires careful planning to ensure the questions are secure and cannot be easily guessed or found out by others."
