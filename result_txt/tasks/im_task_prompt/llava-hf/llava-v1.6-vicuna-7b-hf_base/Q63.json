    "Magnetic Locking System: Integrate a magnetic locking mechanism into the skates to easily secure the wheels in place when not in use. This will reduce the risk of accidents and make it easier for skaters to store their skates.",
    "Energy-Efficient Motors: Upgrade the skates with more energy-efficient motors that prolong the battery life and provide smoother acceleration and braking.",
    "Ergonomic Design: Optimize the shape and size of the skates to reduce strain on the ankles, knees, and hips during longer sessions. This could include a more comfortable and supportive toe and heel stops.",
    "Light System: Add LED lights to the skates for improved visibility, particularly useful for skating in low-light conditions or night-time sessions.",
    "Integrated App: Develop an app that connects with the roller skates, allowing for features such as GPS tracking, speed monitoring, and personalized coaching tips."
