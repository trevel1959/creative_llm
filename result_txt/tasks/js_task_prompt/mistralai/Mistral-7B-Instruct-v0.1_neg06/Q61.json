This could create a unique and expressive musical experience for the musician, as the sound would be directly connected to their movements.",
    "A musical instrument that uses a combination of traditional and unconventional sound sources. For example, the instrument could incorporate sounds from electronic devices, nature sounds, or even the musician's own voice. The resulting sound would be a fusion of different genres and styles, creating a truly original and innovative sound.",
    "A musical instrument that is designed to be played by multiple musicians simultaneously. The instrument would have multiple parts or sections that can be played by different musicians, each contributing their own unique sound. This would create a complex and dynamic musical experience, as the different parts work together to create a cohesive whole.",
    "A musical instrument that uses a unique and unconventional method of sound production.
