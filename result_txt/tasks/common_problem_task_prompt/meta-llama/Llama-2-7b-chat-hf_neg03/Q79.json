    "\"Housing Hubs\": Create a network of interconnected, modular housing units that can be easily assembled and disassembled to accommodate the changing needs of the homeless population. These hubs could be placed in underutilized spaces throughout the city, such as abandoned parking garages or industrial lots. The units would be designed to be self-sustaining, with on-site solar panels, rainwater collection systems, and composting toilets. The hubs could also include community spaces for socializing, job training, and mental health services.",
    "\"Street Sleepers\": Design a series of innovative, portable sleeping pods that can be easily deployed in public spaces to provide temporary shelter for the homeless. These pods could be made from recycled materials and equipped with climate control, bedding, and personal storage. The pods could be placed in areas where homeless individuals are known to congregate, such as bus stations, park benches, or under bridges. The pods could also include charging stations for electronic devices and access to basic hygiene facilities.",
    "\"Green Roofs\": Develop a system of green roofs on existing buildings throughout the city that can be used as temporary or permanent housing for the homeless. The green roofs could be designed with a series of interlocking modules that can be easily assembled and disassembled, allowing for flexibility in design and layout. The modules could be made from a combination of soil, plants, and recycled materials, and could include insulation and climate control systems. The green roofs could also include community spaces, such as gardens, kitchens, and social areas.",
    "\"Bridge Housing\": Create a network of temporary, portable housing units that can be quickly deployed in areas where homelessness is most prevalent. These units could be made from a combination of shipping containers and modular construction, and could be equipped with climate control, bedding, and basic amenities. The units could be placed in areas where homeless individuals are known to congregate, such as encampments or under bridges, and could be easily relocated as needed. The units could also include job training and placement services to help individuals transition into permanent housing.",
    "\"Community Land Trust\": Establish a community land trust that"
