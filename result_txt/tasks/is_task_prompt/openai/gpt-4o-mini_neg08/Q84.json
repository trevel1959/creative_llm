Its shimmering spires, woven from crystal and light, glimmered under the sun. The citizens, known as Skyrunners, glided through the air on feathered wings, crafting dreams into reality.

Realizing the balance between sky and earth was fragile, Lira vowed to unite both worlds, creating harmony above and below.",
