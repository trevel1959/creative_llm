    "**Solar-Powered Wedding:** Organize your wedding in a location that allows for solar-powered energy usage. You can hire a company that provides solar-powered lighting, sound systems, and even food preparation facilities. This not only reduces carbon footprint but also adds a unique, eco-conscious touch to your special day.",
    "**Eco-Friendly Decor:** Use natural elements like plants, flowers, and biodegradable materials for decorations. Opt for reusable or recyclable items instead of disposables. For example, use real flowers and potted plants that guests can take home, or incorporate recycled glass bottles as vases or centerpieces.",
    "**Seasonal and Local Cuisine:** Serve dishes made from locally-sourced, seasonal ingredients. This minimizes the environmental impact associated with transportation and supports local farmers. Additionally, it ensures that the food is fresh and flavorful. You can also offer a vegetarian or vegan menu option to further reduce the carbon footprint.",
    "**Sustainable Transportation:** Encourage guests to use public transport, carpool, or cycle to your wedding venue. You could provide incentives like free parking passes for those who use these methods. Alternatively, arrange for eco-friendly shuttles or bicycles to transport guests to and from the venue.",
    "**Eco-Friendly Guest Gifts:** Instead of traditional favors, give guests gifts that promote sustainability, such as reusable water bottles, bamboo utensils, or organic toiletries. These items will be useful to guests and remind them of the eco-friendly efforts made on their special day."
