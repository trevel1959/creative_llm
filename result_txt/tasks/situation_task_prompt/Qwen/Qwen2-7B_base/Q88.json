    "By Bicycle: Bicycles are a good option for traveling short distances, especially if the terrain is relatively flat and easy to navigate. They can be folded up and carried on public transportation for longer distances.",
    "By Horse or Mule: If traveling over rough terrain or long distances is necessary, horse or mule transport could be an option. This method of transportation has been used for centuries and is still used in some rural areas today.",
    "By Sledge: If traveling over snow or ice, a sledge could be used to transport cargo or people. Sledges are relatively simple to make and can be pulled by people, animals, or even motorized vehicles.",
    "On Foot: The most basic method of transportation, walking can be used for short distances or as a last resort in the event of all other options being unavailable. Even in the absence of roads, there will always be trails, paths, and other ways to navigate your environment.",
    "By Bike Towed by a Fitting Car or Vehicle: This option involves towing a bike using a car or a vehicle. Bikes are much more fuel-efficient and offer a greater range of speed and distance while also being easy to tow if the need arises."
