    "**Ergonomic Handle Design**: Create a pair of scissors with a customizable ergonomic handle that can be adjusted to fit the user's grip size. This could include interchangeable grips made from different materials (e.g., rubber, foam) and shapes that cater to different hand sizes and cutting tasks, thereby reducing strain and improving comfort during prolonged use.",
    "**Self-Sharpening Blades**: Incorporate a self-sharpening mechanism into the blades of the scissors. This could involve a small grinding system that activates when the scissors are closed, maintaining sharpness without the need for manual sharpening. Users would benefit from consistently sharp blades, improving cutting efficiency and longevity.",
    "**Magnetic Cutting Guide**: Design scissors with a built-in magnetic cutting guide that can be adjusted to different angles and distances from the blade. This guide would help users achieve precise cuts, especially for straight lines or specific measurements, making them ideal for crafts, sewing, or any project requiring accuracy.",
    "**Multi-Functional Scissors**: Develop a pair of scissors that can transform into other tools. For instance, they could include detachable components that allow them to function as a screwdriver, bottle opener, or even a small ruler. This would make them a versatile tool for various tasks, especially for those who need to carry multiple tools in a compact form.",
    "**LED Light Feature**: Incorporate a small LED light into the scissors that activates when the handles are squeezed. This would illuminate the cutting area, making it easier to see in low-light conditions or when working on intricate projects. It would be particularly useful for crafters, seamstresses, or anyone working with detailed materials."
