    "Modular Oven Racks: Design oven racks that can be easily customized and reconfigured based on the user's needs. The modular design would allow for more efficient use of space, making it easier to cook multiple dishes simultaneously. Users could also swap out racks with different materials (e.g., wire, solid metal) to suit various cooking techniques and preferences.",
    "Air Fryer Integration: Combine traditional oven functionality with an air fryer to offer users a versatile appliance that can grill, bake, roast, and air fry. This would save space in the kitchen and provide more options for cooking various foods, reducing the need for multiple appliances. It could also include preset programs for popular air fryer recipes to ensure consistent results.",
    "Self-Cleaning Oven: Develop an oven that automatically cleans itself using advanced steam cleaning technology. This would eliminate the need for manual cleaning and save time and effort for users. The self-cleaning feature could also extend the lifespan of the oven by preventing buildup and maintaining optimal performance.",
    "Touchscreen Controls with Recipe Library: Introduce an oven with a high-resolution touchscreen display that offers intuitive controls and access to a vast library of recipes. Users could easily select recipes, adjust settings, and receive step-by-step instructions right on the oven's interface. This feature would be particularly helpful for beginners or those who enjoy experimenting with new recipes.",
    "Smart Cooling System: Incorporate a smart cooling system that adjusts the temperature based on the type of food being cooked and the stage of the cooking process. This would help prevent overcooking or undercooking and ensure consistent results. The system could also monitor the internal humidity levels, making it ideal for delicate items like bread or pastries."
