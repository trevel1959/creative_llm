    "Build a Solar-Powered Water Purification System: Create a solar-powered water purification system that harnesses the sun's energy to filter and purify seawater or rainwater. The system could use a combination of UV light, activated carbon, and reverse osmosis to remove impurities and bacteria, making it safe for consumption. This would provide a reliable source of clean drinking water, essential for survival on a deserted island.",
    "Create a Vertical Garden: Develop a vertical garden that utilizes a trellis or a green wall to grow a variety of fruits, vegetables, and herbs. This would provide a sustainable source of food, reducing the need to forage for wild plants or rely on limited resources. The garden could also help to purify the air and provide shade, making the island a more habitable environment.",
    "Build a Floating Ocean Observatory: Construct a floating ocean observatory that collects and analyzes data on ocean currents, temperature, and marine life. This would provide valuable insights into the island's marine ecosystem, helping to identify potential hazards or opportunities for survival. The observatory could also serve as a beacon for passing ships, increasing the chances of rescue.",
    "Develop a Biodegradable Shelter: Design a biodegradable shelter made from natural materials such as coconut husks, bamboo, and palm fronds. This would provide a sustainable and eco-friendly shelter, reducing the impact on the island's ecosystem. The shelter could also be designed to blend in with the surrounding environment, making it less noticeable to potential rescuers.",
    "Create a Solar-Powered Watercraft: Design a solar-powered watercraft that can be used to explore the surrounding waters and potentially signal for help. The watercraft could be made from sustainable materials and powered by solar panels, providing a reliable and eco-friendly means of transportation. Additionally, the watercraft could be equipped with a communication device, such as a satellite phone, to facilitate communication with potential rescuers."
