    "**Biodegradable Polymers**: These are made from natural resources like cornstarch or sugarcane, and break down easily over time, reducing environmental impact. They could be used in single-use products such as straws, cutlery, and packaging.",
    "**Cellulose-Based Materials**: Cellulose can be extracted from wood pulp and transformed into strong, lightweight, and biodegradable materials. These could replace plastics in items like bottles, bags, and even some forms of textiles.",
    "**Recycled Materials**: Using recycled glass, metal, or even old clothing and textiles to create new products. This approach not only reduces waste but also conserves resources. For example, old plastic bottles could be repurposed into insulation material.",
    "**Plant-Based Composites**: By combining natural fibers like hemp, flax, or bamboo with plant-based resins, we can create durable, sustainable alternatives to traditional plastics. These composites could be used in furniture, automotive parts, and construction.",
    "**Innovative Bioplastics**: Developing new types of bioplastics that are derived from renewable sources and have improved properties compared to conventional plastics. This might include using algae, fungi, or bacteria to produce materials that are stronger, more flexible, or more heat-resistant."
