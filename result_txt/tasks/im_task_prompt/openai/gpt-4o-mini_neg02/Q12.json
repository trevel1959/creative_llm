Additionally, for every wallet sold, a portion of the proceeds could go towards environmental conservation efforts, making it a socially responsible choice.",
    "**Wallet with Integrated Charging Capability**: Design a wallet that includes a built-in wireless charging pad for smartphones.

This feature would be particularly useful for busy individuals who rely heavily on their smartphones throughout the day.",
    "**Modular Wallet System**: Create a modular wallet that allows users to customize their wallet by adding or removing components based on their needs.

This adaptability would cater to various lifestyles and preferences, making it a versatile accessory.",
    "**Augmented Reality Wallet App**: Develop an accompanying app that uses augmented reality (AR) to help users organize their wallets digitally.

The app could also remind users of expiration dates for gift cards or loyalty programs, enhancing the overall wallet experience.",
    "**Travel-Friendly Wallet with RFID Protection and Built-in Tracker**: Create a travel-specific wallet that features RFID-blocking technology to protect against electronic pickpocketing.
