    "Smart Ski Poles: Develop ski poles with built-in sensors that track speed, distance, and calories burned. The sensors could connect to a mobile app that provides real-time data and offers personalized recommendations for improvement. This innovation would enhance the skiing experience and provide skiers with valuable data to monitor their progress.",
    "Glow-in-the-Dark Ski Poles: Create ski poles with a glow-in-the-dark material that illuminates the dark slopes, making it easier for skiers to navigate in low-light conditions. This feature would be particularly useful for night skiing and could provide an added layer of safety.",
    "Heated Ski Poles: Develop ski poles with built-in heating elements that warm the hands during cold weather. This innovation would provide a more comfortable skiing experience and could be especially useful for skiers who spend extended periods on the slopes.",
    "Adjustable Ski Poles: Design ski poles with adjustable lengths and grips, allowing skiers to customize their poles to fit their height and skiing style. This feature would provide a more comfortable and personalized skiing experience.",
    "Augmented Reality Ski Poles: Create ski poles with augmented reality (AR) displays that provide real-time information and enhance the skiing experience. The AR display could show information such as the slope gradient, obstacles, and even virtual ski trails. This innovation would revolutionize the skiing experience and provide skiers with a new level of immersion and engagement."
