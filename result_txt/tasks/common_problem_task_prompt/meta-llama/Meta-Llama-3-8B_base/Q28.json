    "The task force has been meeting for several weeks and has identified several potential problems that could arise in connection with the initiative. The task force has asked you to help them identify additional potential problems.",
    "Your job is to think about the situation and identify as many potential problems or issues that may arise in connection with the initiative. You should try to think of as many potential problems as you can, even if they seem unlikely or unlikely to occur.",
    "When you have identified a potential problem, you should describe it in as much detail as possible. You should also explain why you think the problem might occur and what the consequences of the problem might be.",
    "You should also consider whether there are any solutions or strategies that could be used to prevent or mitigate the problem. If you think of a solution or strategy, you should describe it and explain why you think it would be effective.",
    "You should try to be as creative and original as possible in your thinking. There is no right or wrong answer, and you should not worry about whether your ideas are practical or realistic. The goal is to generate as many potential problems or issues as possible."
