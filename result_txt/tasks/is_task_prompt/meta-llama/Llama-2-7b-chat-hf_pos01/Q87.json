    "Create a virtual reality experience where users can train a cheetah to run faster. Users can interact with the cheetah by providing it with different environments to run in, obstacles to overcome, and rewards for achieving their goals. The user's goal is to help the cheetah reach its full running potential. Confidence Score: 0.8",
    "Develop an augmented reality game where players take on the role of a cheetah and must navigate through a series of challenges, such as avoiding predators, crossing rivers, and catching prey. The game will use motion capture technology to track the player's movements and provide a realistic cheetah experience. Confidence Score: 0.9",
    "Create a robotic cheetah that can learn from its environment and adapt its running style to improve its speed. The robotic cheetah will be equipped with sensors and cameras to gather data on its surroundings and use machine learning algorithms to optimize its running technique. Confidence Score: 0.7",
    "Develop a cheetah-inspired prosthetic leg for individuals with mobility impairments. The prosthetic will be designed to mimic the cheetah's agility and speed, allowing users to move more efficiently and easily. Confidence Score: 0.6",
    "Create a wearable device that uses electrical stimulation to help people run faster and more efficiently, inspired by the cheetah's powerful legs. The device will use sensors to monitor the user's muscle activity and provide targeted electrical stimulation to improve running performance. Confidence Score: 0.8"
