    "**Island Innovation Lab**: Upon arrival, I'd quickly assess the island's resources, identifying potential materials for shelter, tools, and food. I'd create a makeshift lab using natural materials like palm fronds, leaves, and vines. Using the island's resources, I'd design and build a functional water filtration system, allowing me to access clean drinking water. This would be the foundation for my survival.",
    "**Fish Farming**: I'd focus on establishing a sustainable food source by creating a fish farm. Using natural materials, I'd construct a series of interconnected pools and channels, allowing me to cultivate fish for food. This would not only provide a reliable source of protein but also help maintain a balanced ecosystem on the island.",
    "**Solar-Powered Energy**: To overcome the challenges of limited resources, I'd harness the island's solar energy to create a sustainable power source. Using natural materials like bamboo and coconut shells, I'd design and build a solar panel, allowing me to charge devices, power tools, and even create a makeshift communication system.",
    "**Island Agriculture**: I'd focus on cultivating a diverse range of crops, using the island's unique climate and soil conditions to my advantage. By creating a permaculture system, I'd design a sustainable food network, incorporating fruit trees, vegetables, and other essential crops. This would provide a reliable source of nutrition and help maintain a healthy ecosystem.",
    "**Signal Fire and Communication**: To signal for help and potentially establish communication with potential rescuers, I'd create a signal fire using dry wood and other flammable materials. I'd also design a series of reflective surfaces using polished shells, mirrors, or other materials, allowing me to reflect sunlight towards any passing aircraft or ships. This would increase my chances of being spotted and potentially leading to rescue."
