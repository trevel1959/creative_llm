    "Create a garden: If I were the last person on Earth, I would spend my time creating a beautiful garden. I would plant a variety of flowers, fruits, and vegetables to provide me with sustenance and a source of joy. I would also create a cozy seating area where I could relax and enjoy the beauty of nature.",
    "Write a book: I would spend my time writing a book that would be passed down to future generations. It would be a memoir of my experiences and thoughts, and would serve as a reminder of the human spirit and our place in the world.",
    "Build a shelter: I would spend my time building a sturdy shelter that would protect me from the elements. It would be a place where I could feel safe and secure, and would serve as a home base for my survival.",
    "Create art: I would spend my time creating art that would reflect my thoughts and emotions. It could be paintings, sculptures, or any other form of creative expression. It would be a way for me to express myself and connect with my inner self.",
    "Learn new skills: I would spend my time learning new skills that would help me survive in a world without other humans. I could learn how to hunt, fish, and forage for food, how to start a fire, and how to navigate using the stars. It would be a way for me to adapt to my new reality and find a sense of purpose in my existence."
