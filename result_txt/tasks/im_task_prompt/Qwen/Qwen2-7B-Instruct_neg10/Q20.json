It could include features like a solar-powered option, energy-efficient heating elements, and a design that maximizes efficiency while minimizing waste. Additionally, the machine could encourage recycling by offering a system where users earn points for returning used coffee grounds for composting or recycling.",
    "**Social Coffee Maker**: Create a coffee maker that promotes social interaction by integrating a built-in screen or projector. Users can connect their devices to the coffee maker to share photos, videos, or play music during their coffee-making experience. This could turn the mundane task of making coffee into a fun social activity, especially in shared spaces like offices or dormitories.",
    "**Customizable Coffee Maker**: Offer a coffee maker that allows users to customize their brewing process down to the finest detail.

Users can create profiles for their favorite drinks, which the machine will remember and replicate consistently.",
    "**Interactive Coffee Maker Interface**: Design a coffee maker with an interactive touch screen that engages users through games, trivia, or educational content. For instance, while waiting for their coffee to brew, users can answer questions about coffee history, brewing techniques, or participate in mini-games related to coffee production.

    "**Health-Oriented Coffee Maker**: Develop a coffee maker that incorporates health-tracking features, such as measuring the caffeine content in each cup, tracking daily intake, or suggesting alternative ingredients based on dietary restrictions or health goals.
