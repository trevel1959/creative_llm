    "**Augmented Reality (AR) Prosthetic Hand**: I would design a custom AR-enabled prosthetic hand that can interpret my brain signals and translate them into text or speech. This would allow me to communicate through a virtual keyboard or by speaking through a synthesized voice. The prosthetic hand would be equipped with sensors and AI-powered algorithms to detect my brain activity and convert it into a digital format. I could control the hand using my thoughts, and it would respond accordingly. (Confidence score: 0.8)",
    "**Brain-Computer Interface (BCI) Helmet**: I would wear a BCI helmet that uses electroencephalography (EEG) sensors to read my brain activity. The helmet would be connected to a computer or a mobile device, allowing me to communicate through a virtual keyboard or by sending emails/text messages. The BCI would use machine learning algorithms to learn my brain patterns and improve the accuracy of the communication system over time. (Confidence score: 0.9)",
    "**Artistic Expression**: I would express my thoughts and emotions through art, using various mediums like painting, drawing, or sculpture. I would create a series of artworks that convey my ideas and feelings, and others could interpret and respond to them. This would allow me to communicate in a more abstract and creative way, using my imagination and intuition. (Confidence score: 0.7)",
    "**Storytelling through Music**: I would compose music that tells stories and conveys my thoughts and emotions. I would use various instruments or digital tools to create a soundtrack that reflects my inner world. Others could listen to the music and interpret the narrative, allowing us to connect and understand each other on a deeper level. (Confidence score: 0.8)",
    "**Kinetic Sculpture**: I would create a kinetic sculpture that responds to my movements and brain activity. The sculpture would be equipped with sensors and motors that would allow it to change shape, color, or pattern in response to my thoughts. Others could observe the sculpture and interpret its movements as a form of communication, allowing us to engage in a non-verbal dialogue. (Confidence score: 0.9) [/INST] "
