    "**Adjustable Seating with Pressure Relief**: Design an adjustable seating system that automatically adapts to the userâ€™s body shape and weight distribution. This feature could include pressure-relieving materials and a built-in sensor system that detects pressure points, prompting the user to shift positions or adjust the seat to prevent sores and discomfort. The seating could also have heating and cooling options for enhanced comfort in varying climates.",
    "**Integrated Health Monitoring**: Develop a wheelchair that comes with integrated health monitoring devices, such as heart rate monitors, blood pressure sensors, and oxygen saturation meters. These devices could sync with a mobile app to provide users and caregivers with real-time health data, alerts for abnormal readings, and reminders for medication or physical therapy exercises, promoting better health management.",
    "**Multi-functional Armrests**: Create armrests that serve multiple purposes, such as a built-in charging station for devices, cup holders, and even small storage compartments for personal items. Additionally, the armrests could be adjustable to different heights and angles to provide ergonomic support and comfort, making it easier for users to access their belongings or rest their arms during long periods of sitting.",
    "**Foldable and Lightweight Design**: Innovate a wheelchair that is not only foldable but also constructed from lightweight materials like carbon fiber or advanced aluminum alloys. This would make it easier for users to transport their wheelchairs in vehicles or carry them up stairs. The folding mechanism could be designed to be user-friendly, allowing for one-handed operation, and could include a self-locking feature to ensure safety when in use.",
    "**Augmented Reality (AR) Interface**: Integrate an AR interface into the wheelchair that projects information onto the user's field of vision. This could include navigation prompts, notifications about nearby facilities (like restrooms or charging stations), and even social media updates. Users could interact with the AR interface through voice commands or gestures, providing a hands-free way to access information while on the go."
