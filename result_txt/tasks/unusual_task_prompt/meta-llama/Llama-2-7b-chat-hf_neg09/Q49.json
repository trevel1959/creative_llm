    "A \"Timeless\" Picture Frame: Create a picture frame that can shift through time. It can have different settings for different eras, such as a vintage setting for old photographs, a modern setting for recent memories, or even a futuristic setting for a glimpse into the future. The frame can be powered by a small motor or a battery, and the user can simply turn a dial to switch between the different settings.",
    "A \"Mood\" Picture Frame: Design a frame that changes its color or design based on the user's mood. The frame can have different moods, such as a bright and cheerful yellow for a happy mood, a soft and calming blue for a relaxed mood, or a bold and energetic red for a more energetic mood. The frame can use LED lights or color-changing paint to achieve the desired effect.",
    "A \"3D\" Picture Frame: Create a frame that can display 3D images. The frame can use holographic technology or 3D printing to create a 3D image of a person, place, or object. The user can choose the image they want to display and the frame will create a 3D version of it.",
    "A \"Smart\" Picture Frame: Design a frame that can recognize and display images based on the user's preferences. The frame can use facial recognition technology to identify the people in the images and display them in a collage or slide show. It can also use natural language processing to identify the objects or places in the images and provide information about them.",
    "A \"Portal\" Picture Frame: Create a frame that serves as a portal to another location. The frame can have a small screen or display that shows a live feed of a different location, such as a beach or a mountain range. The user can choose the location they want to view and the frame will display it in real-time. This can be achieved through the use of a camera and a small screen, or through the use of augmented reality technology."
