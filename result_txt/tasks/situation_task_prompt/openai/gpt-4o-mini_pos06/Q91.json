    "**Augmented Reality (AR) Safety Glasses**: Create AR glasses that overlay critical safety information onto the wearerâ€™s field of vision. The glasses could highlight potential dangers in the environment, such as wet floors or obstacles, using visual cues like bright colors or symbols. Additionally, they could provide real-time feedback on the user's movements, helping to prevent falls or collisions.",
    "**Environmental Awareness Training**: Implement a comprehensive training program focused on enhancing situational awareness. This program would teach individuals how to read their environment and identify risks based on visual and auditory cues rather than physical sensations. Techniques could include mindfulness practices that help individuals become more attuned to their surroundings, enabling them to anticipate dangers.",
    "**Adaptive Clothing with Protective Features**: Design clothing that incorporates protective features, such as padded layers or built-in armor, to shield the body from impacts. These garments could be lightweight and stylish, allowing the wearer to move freely while providing an extra layer of safety against accidental bumps, falls, or collisions.",
    "**Automated Home Safety Systems**: Install smart home technology that monitors the living environment for hazards. For example, smart sensors could detect smoke, gas leaks, or even the presence of intruders, automatically alerting the individual through visual or auditory notifications. Additionally, smart lighting could illuminate pathways to prevent trips and falls.",
    "**Buddy System with Alert Mechanism**: Establish a buddy system where individuals without sensation work closely with a partner who can help monitor their safety. The partner could carry a small device that communicates with the individual, sending alerts if they are in a potentially dangerous situation. This system would encourage teamwork and provide an additional layer of protection."
