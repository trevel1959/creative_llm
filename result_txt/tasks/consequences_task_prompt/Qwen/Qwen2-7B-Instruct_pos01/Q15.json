    "**Transition to Renewable Energy**: A global shortage of oil would likely accelerate the shift towards renewable energy sources like solar, wind, and hydroelectric power. This transition would require significant investments in infrastructure and technology development, leading to a boom in green industries. The shift could also stimulate innovation in energy storage solutions and efficiency improvements, potentially reducing the overall cost of energy.",
    "**Economic Shifts and Job Losses**: The oil industry is a major employer worldwide, so a sudden shortage would lead to job losses in sectors such as drilling, refining, and transportation. This could trigger economic downturns in regions heavily dependent on oil production or export. However, it might also create new opportunities in renewable energy sectors, leading to a net increase in jobs over time.",
    "**Increased Global Cooperation**: Facing a common challenge like a lack of oil would likely spur international cooperation. Nations could collaborate on developing alternative energy sources, sharing technologies, and creating a global framework for sustainable energy use. This could lead to stronger diplomatic ties and more effective global policies.",
    "**Geopolitical Changes**: Oil has historically played a significant role in geopolitics, particularly in terms of power dynamics and conflict. Without a stable supply, existing alliances could weaken, and new ones could form around shared interests in alternative energy resources. This could lead to shifts in regional power balances and influence the direction of international relations.",
    "**Rapid Urbanization and City Planning**: With increased concerns over resource scarcity, cities might see a push for more efficient urban planning, including denser housing, better public transportation systems, and smarter energy usage. This could lead to a reevaluation of current urban development models and a greater focus on sustainability in city design."
