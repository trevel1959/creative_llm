This allows you to reach high areas of your vehicle without straining your back. The sponge's porous surface will trap dirt and grime, making it easier to clean your car's exterior.",
    "**Scented Air Freshener**: Soak a sponge in a mixture of water and your favorite essential oils, then place it in a small dish or hang it in a mesh bag in your car or home. The sponge will slowly release the scent into the air, providing a natural and long-lasting air freshener. You can change the oils based on the season or your mood.",
