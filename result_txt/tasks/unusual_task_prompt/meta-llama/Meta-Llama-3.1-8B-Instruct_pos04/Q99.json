For example, a hair clip could offer suggestions for adjusting the clip's position or tension to achieve a more polished or textured look.",
    "\"Hair Accessories that Interact with Your Surroundings\": Design hair accessories that can interact with their environment, using sensors and actuators to respond to sounds, lights, or other stimuli.

    "\"Hair Styling Tools that Help You Achieve a Sustainable Lifestyle\": Create a line of hair styling tools that incorporate eco-friendly materials and sustainable design principles. These tools could be made from recycled or biodegradable materials, and designed to be reusable or compostable.
