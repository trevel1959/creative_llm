    "**Self-Cleaning Mechanism**: Design a washing machine with a built-in self-cleaning feature that utilizes steam and high-frequency vibrations to eliminate mold, detergent residues, and odors from the drum. This would reduce maintenance for users and ensure that clothes come out fresh without any unwanted smells or contaminants.",
    "**Eco-Friendly Detergent Dispenser**: Create a compartment that allows for the use of eco-friendly detergent pods that dissolve during the wash cycle. This would eliminate plastic waste from traditional detergent bottles and provide users with a convenient, pre-measured amount of detergent that is effective and environmentally friendly.",
    "**Augmented Reality (AR) User Interface**: Develop an AR interface that allows users to visualize the washing process through their smartphones or tablets. Users could see the progress of their wash, receive notifications about maintenance needs, and even troubleshoot issues by overlaying instructions directly onto the machine via their deviceâ€™s camera.",
    "**Multi-Functional Laundry Hub**: Transform the washing machine into a multi-functional laundry hub that includes a built-in dryer, ironing feature, and folding assistant. The washing machine could wash and dry clothes, then use steam technology to flatten wrinkles before folding them into a neat pile, saving time and space for users.",
    "**AI-Powered Cycle Recommendations**: Implement an AI system that learns the user's laundry habits over time. Based on previous cycles, it could recommend optimal wash settings, detect when certain items need to be washed more frequently, and even suggest the best times to run cycles based on energy costs and availability."
