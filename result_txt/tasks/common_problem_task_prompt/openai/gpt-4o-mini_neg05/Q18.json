    "**Food Preservation Challenges**: Refrigeration is essential for preserving perishable foods. Without electricity, food spoilage can occur rapidly, leading to waste and potential foodborne illnesses. To address this, one could explore alternative food preservation methods, such as canning, drying, or using cool storage techniques like root cellars or iceboxes.",
    "**Water Supply Issues**: Many households rely on electric pumps for their water supply. Without electricity, accessing clean water could become a significant challenge, especially in areas without natural water sources. One solution could be to install a hand pump or rainwater harvesting system to ensure a reliable water supply.",
    "**Heating and Cooling Problems**: Extreme temperatures can pose health risks without electricity for heating or cooling systems. In cold weather, homes may become dangerously cold, while hot weather can lead to heat-related illnesses. One creative solution could be to design passive solar homes that maximize natural light and warmth, along with using thermal mass materials to regulate indoor temperatures.",
    "**Inability to Cook**: Electric stoves and microwaves become useless without power, making meal preparation difficult. To overcome this, one could invest in alternative cooking methods, such as a solar oven, camp stove, or charcoal grill, which would allow for meal preparation without relying on electricity.",
    "**Loss of Entertainment and Leisure Activities**: The absence of electricity can lead to boredom and a lack of entertainment options. To combat this, families could engage in traditional games, storytelling sessions, or outdoor activities like hiking and biking.
