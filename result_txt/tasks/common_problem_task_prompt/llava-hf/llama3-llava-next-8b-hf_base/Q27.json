    "Limited understanding of the disease: To develop an effective vaccine, researchers need to understand the biology of the disease, including its causes, transmission, and symptoms. If there is limited understanding of the disease, it can be difficult to develop a vaccine.",
    "Ethical considerations: Developing a vaccine for a new disease raises ethical questions, such as who should have access to the vaccine and how it should be distributed.",
    "Safety concerns: Vaccines can cause side effects, and there may be concerns about the safety of the vaccine, especially if it is being developed quickly.",
    "Distribution challenges: Once a vaccine is developed, it needs to be distributed to the people who need it. This can be a challenge, especially if the disease is widespread and the vaccine is not widely available.",
    "Resistance to vaccination: Some people may be resistant to getting vaccinated, either because they are skeptical of the vaccine or because they have concerns about its safety."
