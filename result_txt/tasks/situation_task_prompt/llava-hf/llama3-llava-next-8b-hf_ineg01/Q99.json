[
    "Shape: Objects would have distinct shapes that would be easily recognizable even in black and white. For instance, a circular object like a coin would stand out from a square or rectangular object.",
    "Reflection: In black and white, objects would have a unique reflection that could be used to differentiate them. A shiny metal surface would have a different reflection compared to a matte surface.",
    "Shadow: Objects would cast different shadows due to their shapes and materials. Shadows would provide a visual clue to the object's form and could be used to differentiate between objects.",
    "Light absorption: Objects would absorb light differently, which could be used to differentiate them. A white surface would absorb more light than a dark surface, creating a stark contrast.",
    "Sound: In a black and white world, objects would make different sounds when moved or touched. The sound of a hard surface compared to a soft one would be a clear indicator of the object's material."
