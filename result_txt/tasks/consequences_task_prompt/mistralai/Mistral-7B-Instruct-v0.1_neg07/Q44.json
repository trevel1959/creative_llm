    "The world would become a musical utopia, with everyone able to create and appreciate music on a new level. Concerts and performances would become even more spectacular, with everyone able to sing along and participate.",
    "However, not everyone would be able to sing perfectly, and this could lead to social inequality and discrimination. Those who cannot sing may feel left out and excluded, while those who can sing may privileged.",
    "The music industry could also be greatly affected, with many musicians potentially becoming obsolete and struggling to find work. This could lead to economic hardship and social unrest.",
    "It could also lead to a new form of entertainment, with people able to create and perform music in new and innovative ways. This could lead to a new cultural movement and a shift in the way we think about music.",
    "The ability to sing perfectly could also have a profound effect on our emotions and mental health. Singing is known to be a powerful way to express emotions and relieve stress, and if everyone had this ability, it could have a positive impact on the overall well-being of society."
