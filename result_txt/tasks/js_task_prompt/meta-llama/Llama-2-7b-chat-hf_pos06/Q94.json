    "Gravitational Energy: A new form of energy that harnesses the power of gravity. This energy source would be generated by manipulating the gravitational forces between objects, such as planets, stars, or even galaxies. It could be harnessed through advanced technologies like gravitational wave generators or by exploiting the natural gravitational interactions in the universe. Confidence score: 0.8",
    "Solar Wind Energy: A novel approach to harnessing the immense energy of the solar wind, a stream of charged particles emanating from the sun. This energy source would involve creating a large, orbiting collector device that captures and channels the solar wind, then converts it into electricity using advanced magnetic field technology. Confidence score: 0.9",
    "Quantum Fluctuation Energy: A groundbreaking concept that taps into the zero-point energy present in all matter at the quantum level. This energy source would involve developing advanced sensors and technology to detect and harness the fluctuations in quantum energy, which could be converted into usable power. Confidence score: 0.95",
    "Resonance Energy: A new form of energy based on the principle of resonance, where energy is generated by manipulating the natural resonance frequencies of materials. This could involve creating specialized structures or devices that vibrate at specific frequencies to generate energy, or using advanced materials with unique resonance properties to enhance the efficiency of energy production. Confidence score: 0.9",
    "Zero-Point Field Energy: A revolutionary concept that harnesses the energy present in the quantum vacuum, or zero-point field. This energy source would involve developing advanced technologies to extract energy from the quantum vacuum, which could be converted into usable power using sophisticated quantum computing and nanotechnology. Confidence score: 0.95"
