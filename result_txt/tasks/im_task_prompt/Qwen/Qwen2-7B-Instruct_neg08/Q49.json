    "**Personalized Oral Care Experience**: Create a smart electric toothbrush that can track your brushing habits, offer personalized feedback, and even suggest new techniques based on your dental health needs. It could have a companion app that not only logs your brushing history but also provides nutritional advice based on your dietary intake (e.g., recommending foods rich in calcium for better teeth). This way, you can feel motivated to improve your oral hygiene routine without feeling envious of others.",
    "**Social Sharing Feature**: Develop an electric toothbrush with a social media integration feature. After brushing, users can share their brushing session stats (time spent brushing, frequency, etc.) on platforms like Instagram or Facebook. The platform could reward users for consistent brushing through points or badges, which could be redeemed for discounts on dental products or other services. This encourages healthy competition and community support, reducing feelings of jealousy by fostering a sense of belonging and accomplishment.",
    "**Dental Health Insurance Integration**: Integrate the electric toothbrush with dental health insurance platforms. Users can link their insurance information to the toothbrush's app, allowing them to monitor their dental health expenses and claim benefits directly from their phone. This feature can provide peace of mind and financial management, helping users prioritize their dental care without comparing themselves to others.",
    "**Virtual Dental Coach**: Incorporate a virtual assistant within the electric toothbrush that uses AI to mimic the guidance of a professional dentist. The AI can provide real-time feedback during brushing sessions, ensuring that users are using the correct technique and pressure. Additionally, it can offer personalized advice based on their brushing history and dental goals, making users feel more confident and in control of their oral health journey.",
    "**Customizable Brushing Sounds and Themes**: Allow users to customize the brushing experience with various sounds and themes. They can choose music playlists, nature sounds, or themed backgrounds that change color and pattern based on their brushing progress. This personal touch can make the act of brushing more enjoyable and less monotonous, helping users develop a positive association with their oral hygiene routine. Moreover, users can share their custom settings with friends or challenge each other to see who can maintain the most creative and engaging brushing session, creating a fun and collaborative environment."
