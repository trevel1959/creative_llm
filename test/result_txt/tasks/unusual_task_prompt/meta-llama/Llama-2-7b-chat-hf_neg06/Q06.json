    "Tire-themed Art Installation: Create an immersive art installation that transforms a gallery space into a surreal tire landscape. Use recycled tires to create a maze-like structure, with each tire serving as a unique work of art. Incorporate lighting, sound, and scent to enhance the overall experience.",
    "Tire-powered Generator: Develop a generator that harnesses the power of recycled tires to produce clean energy. The generator would use the tire's rubber and other materials to create a sustainable and efficient energy source. This could be used in communities without access to traditional energy sources or as a supplement to traditional energy sources.",
    "Tire-based Furniture: Create a line of furniture made entirely from recycled tires. This could include chairs, tables, and other pieces that showcase the unique texture and pattern of the tires. The furniture could be designed to be both functional and aesthetically pleasing, with a focus on sustainability and durability.",
    "Tire-based Playground: Design a playground that incorporates recycled tires as the primary material. The playground could include tire swings, tire slides, and other interactive elements that encourage creative play and imagination. The tires could also be used to create a unique and visually striking playground structure.",
    "Tire-based Water Filtration System: Develop a water filtration system that uses recycled tires to remove impurities and contaminants from water. The system would use the tire's porous surface to filter out pollutants and contaminants, producing clean and safe drinking water. This could be particularly useful in communities where access to clean water is limited."
